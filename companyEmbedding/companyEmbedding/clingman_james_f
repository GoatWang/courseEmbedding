Reciprocity in the Marketplace   —  July 2017
Articles | Posted by Jim Clingman
							July 22nd, 2017						


We hear a great deal of discussion about the percentage of money Blacks spend with Black businesses versus how much we spend with White businesses—and others as well.  It is said that 90%+ of Black dollars are spent at non-Black businesses.  Obviously, that leaves about 10% for our businesses. What are we getting for that 90%?  Blacks must drastically change our spending habits and/or leverage what we do spend.  
The average annual revenue (sales) for Black owned businesses without employees is $58,000 and for those with paid employees it is $948,000, both of which are much lower than other so-called “Minority Groups.”
A report published by the U.S. Small Business Administration, titled, “Minority Business Ownership: Data from the 2012 Survey of Business Owners” by Michael McManus, Regulatory Economist, had this to say about Sales Disparities: 
“Evaluating disparities using per-firm sales average shows the stark difference between minority and nonminority firms. It also highlights key variations between minority groups. For example, [Black]-owned firms average about $58,000 in sales per firm, while Hispanic firms generate two and a half times this amount; Asian-owned firms, 6 times as much; and nonminority-owned firms over 9 times this amount.”
One can reasonably extrapolate a couple of things from that point: Black businesses must grow to the point of being able to hire employees; and Black businesses need a great deal more support—from Black consumers as well as other consumers—to reach parity.  
One other point of consideration is the industry in which we choose to start a business. The report states, “While the number of minority-owned businesses is growing rapidly, disproportionate amounts are in the lowest 20 industries in terms of sales. In aggregate almost 58.9% of all African American-owned businesses are in the 20 lowest sales-generating industries…”
Finally, as I have cited many times, of the more than 2.6 million Black businesses only 111,000 have employees.  Do the math and see why we must grow our businesses in order to make them more viable in the marketplace.  In order to have more of our $1.2 trillion flowing through Black businesses we must have larger ones in more profitable industries.  Make sense?
Now here’s the rub against us as consumers of Black products and services from Black entrepreneurs.  Paradoxically, while we must have more sustained growth and we must venture into more scalable business ventures, many Black consumers are buying  from other groups and some are even refusing to do business with Black firms, for one reason or another.  Add that reality to the fact that other groups do not support our businesses to any great degree, which could be due in part to the industries we select, and Black business is stuck on a treadmill, expending a lot of energy without moving forward, multiplying but never growing.  
Top all of this off with the fact that we hold our entrepreneurs to a higher standard than we hold others.  We want reciprocity from them, and we want them to “give back,” which is quite reasonable and appropriate.  However, we do not demand the same level of reciprocity from the other businesses that we support virtually every day.  Don’t agree?  Then tell me, where is the balance of our $1.2 “trillion” annual income when we deduct the $188 “billion” in annual revenues earned by Black businesses, not all of which comes from Black consumers?  
Let’s face it, Black consumers could never spend all of our $1.2 trillion with Black owned businesses; we do not have enough businesses for that ideal to become a reality.  We can certainly increase the amount we currently spend, but until we establish and grow more businesses, which will take at least a generation if we concentrate on it, we will continue to spend vast sums of money with businesses other than our own.  So why are we not seeking reciprocity from them?
We must use collective leverage that can be given or withdrawn at a moment’s notice.  Understanding that Black consumers cannot get around spending dollars with non-Black companies, the Collective Banking Group of Maryland (www.collectiveempowermentgroup.org), and its local chapters, work with White owned and other companies, in mutually beneficial strategic partnerships,  to obtain reciprocity. Banks, furniture stores, carpet stores, automobile companies, restaurants, movie theaters, supermarkets, and many other companies that profit from the Black dollar should reciprocate to their Black customers beyond sponsoring a dinner or a youth baseball team.
If we are going to spend tremendous sums of money with White owned, Indian owned, Chinese owned, and Arabic owned businesses, then it’s up to us to initiate and negotiate reciprocal agreements that benefit both groups.  One side of that equation is already complete: We benefit them.  Since we inevitably will keep spending our money with them, don’t you think we should complete the equation by getting some benefit ourselves?

It’s your money.  —  July 2017
Articles | Posted by Jim Clingman
							July 17th, 2017						


Yet another report, the Nielsen African American Consumer Report, was released in October 2016.  Titled, “Young, Connected, and Black – African American millennials are driving social change and leading digital advancement,” it points out various issues related to how Blacks spend our dollars, with an emphasis on our young people.   To put it bluntly, this report is about your money—how much you earn, what you spend it on, and how it can be obtained from you in exchange for products and services.  Yes, it’s your money, but for how long?
Since most of us will not read a 56-page consumer report, I am going to draw heavily from its contents in hope that you, the Black consumer, will learn to teach your dollars how to make more sense.  Information is only power if you use it appropriately.  The Nielsen Report contains a lot of information, but the question is:  Who will benefit from it?    
The report states, “African-Americans are exuberant and reflective—optimistic about present-day advances in income, education, entrepreneurship and healthcare, and determined to forge a better future as influential leaders and catalysts of social awareness against discrimination and social injustice. With incomes steadily rising at a rate that outpaces that of the general population, African-Americans’ ‘buying power’ is expected to grow 21.6% between now and 2020, by which time it will reach just over $1.4 trillion…”  Is it Black buying power or Black buying weakness?
Nielsen says, “African-American consumers are focused on ‘eating well’ and ‘looking good,’ over-indexing across a wide variety of product categories, ranging from beauty products to fresh foods and ingredients that reflect their proud heritage and cultural traditions. ..There is a ‘clear opportunity’ for innovation and new-product development in the convenient-healthy eating space.” Are Black people taking advantage of the “opportunity” we have created? 
In a section titled, Valuing the Beauty Within, the report states, “Personal image is highly valued and is regarded with an immense sense of pride in the African-American community. African-American millennials have higher buying rates (per household) for hair care products and personal soap and bath products than their millennial counterparts.”  Do you think they are talking about Black manufactured products?
Another section, Feeling Proud, Looking Good, and Spending More, points out that, “Personal image is highly valued and is regarded with an immense sense of pride in the African-American community. Consumer product companies have long been aware of the ‘dedicated consumption’ of personal healthcare items by Black consumers. African-Americans of all ages show higher buying rates than non-African-Americans for women’s fragrances, grooming aids, personal soap and bath needs, deodorant, sanitary protection, family planning, and feminine hygiene…The long history of personal care spending has led many consumer products companies to offer highly-developed lines of popular African-American cosmetic, fragrance, and hair-care products that cater to the wants and needs of African-American men and women.”  Is that why L’Oréal has purchased Black hair care and cosmetic companies? As their commercial says, “Because [you’re] worth it.”   
Uh oh, here it comes, the pièce de résistance:  “Optimism about the future. In 2012, for the first time in American history, African-Americans had the highest rate of voter registration and turnout of all races, 66% versus 64%. And while the majority of African-Americans are optimistic that the country is headed in the right direction, there is an ongoing need in their communities for more affordable housing, healthcare, childcare and higher education.”  Does that seem a bit oxymoronic to you?  Besides, what did we get from all that voting?
The report says, “In 2015, African-Americans ‘controlled’ $1.2 trillion in buying power, 8.6% of the nation’s total, and a 21% increase over 2010…The gains in Black buying power reflect not only African-Americans’ population growth, but also their increasing education and entrepreneurship, as well as their advancing into their peak earning years.”  Our money is “subject” to our “control” but we are not appropriately controlling it; we do not leverage it. 
Finally, the report says, “Nielsen has provided these reports to better illustrate the ‘unique’ qualities of the African-American community, the ‘business opportunities’ that exist, and the best methods for a productive and successful ‘connection.’  As business executives look for opportunities to grow their businesses and gain market share, it is critical to measure and evaluate the opportunities.”

Dr. James Lance Taylor points out that Black millennials, many who earn $60,000 to $85,000 straight out of college, are migrating to the south in record numbers.  Armed with that kind of money they must take full advantage of it, collectively, and build something for themselves and their progeny—something they “control.”
Black consumers are the most studied segment in this nation, because as Willie Sutton once said when asked why he robbed banks, “That’s where the money is.”  It’s our money this report is talking about, Black folks; are we accessing the opportunities therein?

A Timeless Strategy  —  July 2017
Articles | Posted by Jim Clingman
							July 9th, 2017						


Before we are able to make the kind of meaningful progress necessary to bring about a change in our economic status, we must educate ourselves in the areas of collectivism, mutual economic responsibility, and the advantages of supporting one another in our endeavors.
Economic empowerment does not have to be shrouded by confusing economic terms nor as complicated as many of us think it is.  Economics, for our purposes, must be brought down from the lofty heights of academia to the “street talk” with which we are all familiar.  It too must become a part of our vernacular, because at that level we will be able to deal with our concerns, our complaints, and our problems with the only ammunition that is effective:  Our Dollars.
During the sit-ins of the 1960’s, while we were seeking equality and the right to integrate socially, we began to lose sight of the economic advantages we did have, the most important of which were Black owned businesses; they soon began to fade away. As we explored our new found “right” to buy the same products and services we had always bought, only now we could enter through the front door instead of the back door, we forgot about our own businesses.  Another boycott was about to begin—that of our own businesses by our own people.

This is not to discredit the sacrifices we made to bring about our civil rights; those were some of the most important and significant times in Black history.  We owe a debt of gratitude to those who helped make it possible for many of us to have the things we have today.  But now, with the so-called “New World Order”, with all of our political and social progress, we are even more behind, economically, than we were a generation ago.
Why is this true?  One reason is the political complacence that sets in after we elect Black people.  Black Mayors and Black Congresspersons do not necessarily equate to Black economic prosperity.  Our African-American politicians can only do so much, and sometimes that’s very little, to relieve the plight and blight of our communities.  After we have helped them get into office, we cannot then sit back and wait to see what they are going to do “for” us.  We must continue to help them so they will be able to do something “with” us.
Our politicians, at least the ones we helped get elected, must be accountable to us, and that will only happen if we abide by the one rule that counts in politics:  The money rule.  Unless African Americans are willing to support our candidates with our dollars as well as our voices, we will have neither accountability nor influence in the political arena. 
We, as a national community, are generally well skilled in making our points when it comes to social issues.  But, we are sorely lacking in our knowledge and execution of basic economic strategies for our local communities.  Politics is important but first we must support one another, demand reciprocity from those with whom we do business, and work together toward ownership of our communities.  Politics will fall in place when economics succeeds.
Collectivism was a very positive precept of our African ancestors. Today, in some circles, that principle has been put forth as the sole reason for the dearth of African-American entrepreneurs.  Some say that because we are a communal people, we are reluctant to seek the individual path of entrepreneurship.  This may be partially true, but it does not have to prevent us from using that same spirit of communality to support those of us who are entrepreneurs.  Can you imagine how empowered we would be if we drew upon our basic natural inclination to be a real community?  We would be well on our way to economic, social, and political parity.
Right now, we don’t count.  Can you imagine that?  We spend a trillion dollars, and we don’t count.  Why?  There’s no need for the majority to deal with us in any serious manner, especially economically, because we do not act collectively.  That’s not to say that we should all think alike and act alike and never disagree.  It simply means that we should consider one another first and not be so willing to push one another aside for own individual advancement.  
In this country, for Blacks, economics must be collective and cooperative.  Witness all of the mergers, buyouts, alliances, and conglomerates occurring today among other companies.  African Americans must practice the principle some of us only celebrate one day each year: UJAMAA (Cooperative Economics).  If we do that, we will count, we will be empowered, and we will prosper.
Note: Believe it or not, with the exception of two updates, I wrote this article in March 1993.

Look back and see the future.  (Part Two)	 —  July 2017
Articles | Posted by Jim Clingman
							July 3rd, 2017						


An excellent example of the impact our history has on the way we are today, especially economically, can be found in an article titled, The Reluctant Entrepreneurs, by Joel Kotkin, author of the book, Tribes.
The feature discusses several reasons for Blacks not going into business and being surpassed in this area by other ethnic groups.  Among other reasons, the history of African Americans was cited.  The article quotes Robert Hill, a Black Historian at the University of California at Los Angeles, who traced the lack of entrepreneurial tradition to African origin and the brutality of the American system of slavery.  “Africa”, Hill explained, “is more a communitarian society, where notions of private property have never been so entrenched as in Europe or North America.  The culture of capitalism is just not part of our African heritage.”
The piece goes on to say, “…certainly slavery and its progeny, the sharecropper system, did nothing to foster confidence, independence, or a capitalist inclination among African Americans.  Before slavery and after, white landowners believed the proper way to treat the Black was, in the words of one slave owner, ‘to create in him a habit of perfect dependence…’ And it was a system that proved to be enormously successful and enduring.”
The article continued, “we are a race of people who for generations, both before and after Emancipation, were denied freedom of movement, education, and even a rudimentary familiarity with the free market, not to mention credit, legal status, or safety from lynch mobs.  That we, as descendants, have not taken naturally to entrepreneurship should hardly come as a big surprise.”
The fact still remains that despite their poorest of circumstances, some Black people engaged in entrepreneurship even before the Emancipation, and did well at it.  According to John Sibley Butler, in his outstanding work, Entrepreneurship and Self-Help Among Black Americans, “They (Black entrepreneurs) became the merchant class in northern cities, and it was through their enterprises that Black income in the last third of the nineteenth century grew faster than that of whites.”
The INC. article cited the economic protestations of Booker T. Washington, who established the National Negro Business League, exhorting Blacks to “uplift” themselves by striking out on their own.  It celebrated the “new” ministers like Adam Clayton Powell, who urged aspiring congregants to go into business on a larger scale.  
While early Black businesses had to rely solely on the Black consumer market, such is not the case today.  However, if we do not move collectively through the economic maze, making our monetary clout felt in the widest of circles and obtaining the reciprocity we deserve as a massive consumer army, our businesses will not achieve the growth they need to prosper in this economy.  Moreover, African Americans will have abdicated our responsibility to carry forth the legacy passed on to us by our fathers and mothers.
We must never forget our history and the reasons for our attitudes on economics, business ownership, and mutual support.  We must also realize that if we are going to make it in this country, we had better get down to business NOW!  I think our ancestors would be proud.
Economic empowerment is a constant struggle, and if we do not view it as a struggle, we will never achieve the goals to which we aspire.  No one is going to “give” us anything.  If they do, it will not be without encumbrances.   The economic power we seek is within us all, and examples for us to follow are everywhere.  We simply need more cooperation within our own ranks.
In seeking that economic power, remember what Frederick Douglass said:  “…This struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be moral and physical; but it must be a struggle.  Power concedes nothing without demand.  It never did and it never will.  Find out just what people will submit to, and you have found the exact amounts of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them…The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress.”
I say: If we rise up, as Marcus Garvey exhorted us, resolving to cooperate with one another and do for ourselves, our economic manifesto would be clear.  Our struggle will be easier, and the powers we face will concede to our demands.  However, if African Americans choose individuality over collectivism, yes a few of us will “make it”, but we will go down in history as a paradoxical people; a people who, with all of our wealth and knowledge, acquiesced and continued in economic oppression.   And the blame will rest squarely upon our shoulders.  
Let our past be the light that guides us to a brighter economic future.

Look back and see the future.  (Part One)	  —  June 2017
Articles | Posted by Jim Clingman
							June 24th, 2017						


I often use the phrase, “Our history is our future,” to express the fact that everything we need to do today, vis-à-vis economic empowerment, has been done before by African Americans in this country.  Just look back at what Black people built in Mound Bayou, Mississippi, Durham, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma’s Greenwood District. Take a closer look at what Booker T. Washington was doing with his National Negro Business League; read about Black entrepreneurs in Cincinnati and Philadelphia during the early 1800’s, and you will see the economic future of African Americans is, indeed, grounded in our history.		
I wonder why it takes us so long to do what we know is right.  In the context of the economic well-being of African Americans, most of us know what “we need” to do. Yet we seem content to discuss, “intellectualize,” meet, and complain about how unfair the system is.  For those “we need to…” folks out there, if you see the need, do the work.
One thing most of us know is that economic empowerment and business development—vertical business development—are vital to our economic prosperity.  Naturally following the development of businesses is the support of those businesses by consumers.   To illustrate that point, I am reminded of what a friend once told me: “Production minus sales equals scrap.”
In the 1800’s there were many flourishing Black owned businesses.  In spite of the worst brand of slavery ever perpetrated on a people, Black businesses survived and grew.  Economic growth was a reality, even in the face of the racial prejudice that existed, because we were determined, and we stuck together.	
In 1853, a convention was held in Rochester, New York, to discuss “Afro-American Economics.”   Slogans like “Buy Black” and “Double Duty Dollars” began at conventions like this one, all over the country.  What happened to us since that time?  Have we drifted so far from our heritage and from the things that benefit us as a whole?  Have we become so selfish and so self-centered that we have completely lost sight of our values toward one another?	
Businesses are the foundation of a true community.  Our current 2.4 million Black owned businesses, compared to the 45 million of us, are but a drop of water in the ocean, especially when you factor in the relatively meager annual revenues those businesses take in.  We must change that.

Our time should be devoted to starting and supporting business ventures, rather than complaining about how difficult things are out there and how the “Arabs” and Asians dominate our neighborhoods when it comes to business ownership.  We must find common ground to move beyond the stagnation and complacency in which we have been mired for so long.  Organization, unity, and mutual support are the keys to our economic freedom.
Cooperative economics among African Americans is an idea that has been around for hundreds of years.  It could not be resisted during the early years of American history, and it cannot be resisted today.  It is up to us to take advantage of that fact as we move forward.  It is time to make individual commitments to “do” something rather than sit back and “let someone else do it.”  It is time to stop complaining and blaming someone else for our plight.  It is time for us to give up that lame excuse, “There is no use trying to change things, because we are never going to get together anyway.”	 I don’t buy those tired words, and I hope you don’t buy them either.  All we have to do, instead, is buy from one another, for the benefit of us all.  The precedent exists; look at it and learn from it.
My primary example of seeing a need and doing the work (although there are several during my lifetime that I could share) is my current work for our people: THE One Million Conscious and Conscientious Black Contributors and Voters (OMCCBCV).  Our historical grounding is found in the words of Marcus Garvey: “The greatest weapon used against [Black people] is disorganization.”  Thus, we are organized, united, and unapologetically determined to contribute to the economic elevation of our people.  We saw the need and set out to do the work; and we will continue that work as we learn from our past and strive for a better future for our children.  If you would like to join us, go to www.iamoneofthemillion.com Next week, part two of this article will give a deeper look at why and how the system in which we live has caused some of us to be complacent.  It will also offer a way to change our situation.

Another opportunity to support a Black business  —  June 2017
Articles | Posted by Jim Clingman
							June 17th, 2017						


This week’s article is a follow up to my Food Desert article.  One week after writing it I learned about a young sister in the Los Angeles area, Compton to be exact, who had bought a supermarket.  Kia Patterson, the first Black in L.A. to do so, now is the independent owner-operator of a Grocery Outlet store that, in essence, presents yet another opportunity for us to support a Black owned supermarket.  Question is: Will we do it?

I called Ms. Patterson immediately after watching a video interview of her inside her store; I was thoroughly impressed.  After speaking to her I contacted her marketing/PR rep and suggested ways I could help get the word out about Ms. Patterson’s venture.  This article is part of that effort, in addition to my asking radio talk show personalities to feature her as a guest.  Even those of us who do not live in L.A. or its surrounding cities should be willing to cheer Ms. Patterson on and share her information with others across this nation.  Hers is one of the examples I wrote about in my previous article; maybe similar ventures by Black people will come from this latest foray into the food industry, and this time it will be sustained; I truly hope so.

Kia Patterson was born in Gardena and raised in Lynwood, both located in California. She has been in the grocery industry since the age of 17, starting as the “service clerk” for a well-known supermarket. Her career moved very fast and was later promoted to store manager. After that, she had the opportunity to join the corporate office for a special project, which resulted in a promotion to a Store Systems Specialist. Kia’s dedication and professionalism did not go unnoticed and, after having spent seventeen years in her first grocery job, Grocery Outlet approached with the opportunity to become an independent owner-operator. 
Kia joined the Grocery Outlet family in June 2016. She trained at their Long Beach location and was very grateful to have received training by two very experienced operators. On April 1, 2017, Kia made her dream of becoming an entrepreneur a reality when she became the independent owner-operator of the Compton location.

I know the demographics have changed for Compton over recent years, but that should not be used as an excuse not to support Kia’s store.  Maggie and John Anderson drove 36 miles round trip, from Oak Park to Southside Chicago to support a Black owned grocery store.  I drove a similar distance to support a Black owned dry cleaners in Cincinnati, Ohio.  Call us crazy, but we believe as W.E.B. Dubois said, “We must cooperate or we are lost.  Ten million people who join in intelligent self-help can never be long ignored or mistreated.  The mass of the Negroes must learn to patronize business enterprises conducted by their own race, even at some disadvantage.”
Kia immediately connected with the community of Compton because it is the neighboring city to Lynwood (where Kia grew up) and started donating food items on a weekly basis to some of the local churches. Kia has also partnered with El Camino Compton Center to launch their food pantry to help less fortunate students with food items. Most recently, Kia began to help the community learn how to incorporate healthy and affordable eating habits, by hosting “smart shopping” store tours where a registered nutritionist guided shoppers to identify nutritious food choices. 
In addition to these initiatives and to further contribute to the advancement of her community, during the month of May and June, Kia has partnered with the Magic Johnson Foundation to conduct a fundraising competition to benefit four elementary schools in the Compton Unified School District. As a result, the schools will receive cash prizes that will be used in different educational activities.  And for those looking for healthier food choices, Grocery Outlet stores like Kia’s offer more than 500 Natural, Organic, Specialty, and Healthy items.

Now here is an appropriate response to Kia’s business venture and her efforts to “give back” to the community:  Dr. Rosie Milligan, nationally acclaimed author, local entrepreneur, community activist, and self-proclaimed “Mayor of South Central L.A.,” will revise her “Get on the bus” campaign, which she implemented in past years to take groups of customers to Black businesses to shop. Dr. Rosie will now organize groups to visit Patterson’s store and do their weekly shopping.     
I am very excited about this news, and I want to see this business grow from the support of Black consumers as well as all consumers—the same way Black people support everyone else’s stores.  Let’s flip the script on the mantra, the song, and the movie, “Straight outta Compton,” by making our refrain, “Straight into Compton” to support a Black business.

Food Deserts	  —  June 2017
Articles | Posted by Jim Clingman
							June 3rd, 2017						


Why do we have Food Deserts?  One reason is that we have deserted our own stores.  Instead of taking care of ourselves, we complain about stores owned by someone else.  We petition our politicians for a grocery store or seek private companies to open stores where we live, but seldom do we open stores ourselves.  Even when Blacks do open new supermarkets we do not support them, and they eventually are forced to close.  Think I’m wrong? Keep reading.
At the turn of the last century (1900) Black people began to form food co-ops and other collective purchasing programs to feed themselves and to leverage lower prices for Black consumers. Two of the first grocery co-ops were started in St. Louis and Chicago by B. G. Shaw and Robert Jackson, respectively, in 1919.
The most notable co-op was the Colored Merchants’ Association (CMA), founded by A.C. Brown in Montgomery, Alabama in 1923.  With assistance from the National Negro Business League, under the leadership of Albon Holsey, the CMA became a national organization that encouraged Black grocers to unite.  In 1936, Holsey stated, “…the CMA began to lose the confidence of the Black consumer.”  Black Economist, Abram Harris, said, “Members always found it difficult to sell CMA brands.  The Negro, like the White consumer, is habituated to the popular brands carried by the chains.”  Source:  Dr. Juliet E.K. Walker.
Desertion of Black stores by Black consumers led to market opportunities for outsiders to take full advantage of the Black food dollar.  We became dependent upon others, and now we even request their presence in our neighborhoods.  No better picture of that reality than Singletary’s Supermarket in Columbus, Ohio in the mid-1980’s.  I wrote many articles about Singletary’s and even spent time there doing a product sampling program.  Singletary’s was a brand new business at that time, clean, well-stocked, and more convenient to Blacks in the Mt. Vernon neighborhood than other grocery stores.
Author of “Tribes,” Joel Kotkin, wrote:  “In Columbus, Ohio…Singletary Plaza Mart, the nation’s largest Black-owned ‘superstore,’ went out of business…due to a lack of community patronage. Although Blacks in Columbus spend $2.5 million each week on food, they couldn’t be convinced to spend less than a tenth of it, or $200,000, to keep Singletary afloat.”   The Reluctant Entrepreneurs, INC Magazine, 1986.  Desertion.
In 1995, in Lakeland, Florida, an interdenominational group of Black ministers took their church members shopping.  A two month-old Black-owned grocery store was not doing very well in the community, so the ministers got together to help.  The ministers took 150 people to the store, called Fresh Supermarket Foods.  After two hours, the shoppers had spent $4,000.00, according to the owner, Mr. Frank Jackson.  Paul Sanders, pastor of Greater St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church, said, “At stake is getting more Blacks to support [one another].  We talk about power.  But if we don’t have some businesses or some money, we can talk about power all we want and it won’t come.”  Sanders continued, “If the store does not succeed, it will be because of a lack of community support.”  Desertion. 
Three other recent examples include Fresh Market supermarket in nearly 100% Black, Southside Chicago.  Owner, Karriem Beyah, whose store was included in Maggie and John Anderson’s “Empowerment Experiment,” agreed that the awareness and enthusiasm the Anderson’s created was important, but Beyah added that his business may have suffered from being highlighted as an enterprise owned by an African-American.  (He closed the store in August 2009)  “If you’re under the radar, then maybe you won’t get that belief from customers that the other guy’s ice is colder than yours,” he said. But, “I’m not giving up.”  (Beyah plans to open a new store this year, 2017.
Second is the 2014 closing on the last Calhoun’s Supermarket in Montgomery, AL., after losing money for “three or four years,” according to owner, Greg Calhoun, who made history as the first African American in the South to own a supermarket.  At one point, Calhoun had seven stores in Montgomery alone, a majority Black city.  ShaKenya Calhoun cried as she closed the doors one final time. “The market has just been oversaturated with grocery stores…With the lack of sales, there’s not an economic impact for us to be in business.”
Third, there’s the much ballyhooed Sterling Farms’ grocery store in New Orleans, co-owned by actor, Wendell Pierce, who wanted to bring healthy food to underserved communities.  That store closed one year after opening.  It drew national media attention when it opened, including a visit from Michelle Obama who was touting her Fresh Food Initiative to bring healthy grocery options to so-called “food deserts.”
What will it take for us to feed ourselves?  We have the money; we just lack the mindset.  History will not treat us kindly if we fail to act appropriately.

NAACP in Transition	  —  May 2017
Articles | Posted by Jim Clingman
							May 29th, 2017						


The national office of the NAACP has made a couple of significant changes lately; they dismissed the Chairwoman, Roslyn Brock, and the President, Cornell Brooks.  Although I served in various capacities within the Cincinnati branch for nine years (2005-2014), through which we did excellent work for our community, I have not been a fan of the national office since Myrlie Evers took over back around 1994 or so.  My experiences in our local branch left a bitter taste in my mouth as I watched the national office use its national representative, the “Luca Brasi” of the NAACP, Gill Ford, to intimidate members and even suspend them for life because they refused to capitulate to his will. 
Many branches across the country have suffered from Ford’s arrogance, collusion, and disruption of local branch elections and other branch activities.  He had his own agenda for certain branches and exercised it summarily and arbitrarily without sanction or even a response from his national bosses.  Despite branches calling, writing, suing, and filing complaints against this guy, he continued to ride roughshod over the local proletariat, the volunteers, who do much of the work and pay a great deal in dues and assessment fees to the national office.
Ford’s actions, supported or ignored by his superiors in Baltimore, showed me it was all about control and money, and never about support of local branches, that is, unless those branches bent to the dictatorial will of Gill Ford.  But, I am proud to say that during my tenure we stood up to the bully and did our work in spite of him doing everything he could to control us. Although I have not seen an announcement of his dismissal, I really hope he is gone as well and, if not, that the new administration will reel him in and monitor what he does a lot more than his former bosses did.  Much of the negativity and chaos within branches has been caused by Ford, and overlooked by Brock, Brooks, and Ben Jealous.
Leon Russell, Board Chair, and Derrick Johnson, Vice-Chair, sent a letter out announcing the termination of Brooks along with their intentions for the future of the NAACP.  Following is an excerpt from that letter:
“… in the coming months, our leadership will embark on a ‘listening tour for the first time in our history’. It is clear that Americans of all genders and ages, from all of the corners of all 50 states, have been aching to be understood, to be seen — and now, they are demanding to be heard. We want to meet those demands, and in doing so, ensure that we are harnessing the energy and voice of our grassroots membership as we pursue transformational change. As we reimagine ourselves, we want to be formed in the likeness of the people whom we serve — and to do so, we must first see, meet and listen to them…As we embark on this journey, everyone will have a place at the table”
The most striking statement to me is that in 107 years, the NAACP has never gone on a “listening tour” to hear from its branches; but I will let you draw our own conclusions from that excerpt, and I encourage you to read the entire letter; read it and critically analyze it to see if it meets your approval, especially if you are a member.  
The once vaunted and heralded NAACP has finally gotten the message it seems, and is ready to hear from the grassroots.  I trust they are truthful in that regard and will follow through on their statements.  If they do not and merely put a new face on the same old problems, my advice is for members to walk away and leave them to their own devices. If they are sincere, I urge you to support this new vision and get involved to help bring it to fruition.
A Black organization with over a half million members can do so much to move us toward economic empowerment. It will not happen if corruption and distrust exist at the top.  Nor will it happen if those on the local level participate in that corruption and/or turn a blind eye, a deaf ear, and a mute voice to election tampering and mistreatment of branches that refuse to go along with the nonsense from the national office.
I wish Brothers Russell and Johnson well in their quest to recapture the glory of the NAACP, but they should know there is a great deal of discontentment out there, which must be heard and respected.  When that is acknowledged and dealt with, fairly and immediately, the organization can move forward; but it will not until that happens. Suggestion: A great place to start the listening tour is Ohio; it has been at the center of the storm for years.

Fathers and Daughters
Book Orders | Posted by Jim Clingman
							February 6th, 2017						



In celebration of a very special love affair, this book is nationally acclaimed by parents and children, young and older. It is timeless. “Clingman encourages positive relationships between fathers and their daughters. His reflections show how powerful and enhancing the father/daughter bond can be. It is important for dads to understand how much their little girl needs them.” Alvin F. Poussaint, MD. Fathers and Daughters is prose, poetry, and pictorials of fathers and their “Little Girls.” A definite keeper–on your coffee table.
Price: $20.00 plus postage.

Sticky: The “Little” Book – First, You Cry
Book Orders | Posted by Jim Clingman
							April 20th, 2016						



A poignant and personal disclosure of the thoughts, feelings, fears, and hopes of a victim of ALS.  A spiritual perspective tempered by real-life issues, the writer describes his particular trial in a way in which anyone, whether afflicted or in great health, can relate.  He also acknowledges and describes the difficulties appertaining to caregivers of those who suffer from debilitating illnesses.  
Uplifting and victorious in the end, but along the way, “First, You Cry” reaches deep into our hearts and souls to challenge and strengthen our fundamental beliefs, not in an ominous or fatalistic manner, but with a hopeful resolve and a buoyant spirit.  This “Little Book,” as Clingman describes it, began as a personal journal for his family members to read, but is now a public disclosure of his trial, his tears, and his ultimate triumph over the scourge of ALS.
Price:  $15.00 (Free S&H).  Churches and Non-Profits: $10.00 plus S&H for 10 or more books
To order call 513 315 9866 or email to jamesclingman653@yahoo.com

New Book: Black Dollars Matter
Book Orders | Posted by admin
							May 2nd, 2015						


Black Dollars Matter – Teach your dollars how to make more sense
AVAILABLE NOW! in hard copy and Kindle eBooks on Amazon.com, the latest offering from the nation’s most prolific writer on economic empowerment for Black people, Clingman’s 5th book on the subject aptly describes the dominant-submissive relationship between economics and politics, respectively. It contains stark and sometimes biting commentary, statistical data, and documentary information, with thought provoking quotations sprinkled throughout.
Beginning with the run-up to the U.S. Presidential election in 2007, and ending with practical tactics and strategies for economic and political success heading into the 2016 election, Black Dollars Matter is a searchlight to find solutions; it is also a spotlight that illuminates the way forward, and it definitely admonishes us to “teach our dollars how to make more sense.”

BLACK EMPOWERMENT WITH an ATTITUDE! – You got a problem with that?
Book Orders | Posted by admin
							January 17th, 2010						


Black Empowerment must be accompanied by an “Attitude” if we are going to build an economic future for our children, if we are serious about obtaining an economic foothold in our neighborhoods with the goal of changing them from “hoods” into real communities, and if we are determined to move from being consumers, for the most part, to producers, wholesalers, retailers, and distributors.
Let no one inoculate you with evil doctrines to suit their conveniences. There’s no humanity before that which starts with yourself, ‘Charity Begins at Home.’ First to thyself be true and thou canst not then be false to any man.
[God] first made us what we are and then out of our own creative genius we make ourselves what we want to be.
Marcus Mosiah Garvey
“Be angry, but do not sin…” Ephesians 4:26
