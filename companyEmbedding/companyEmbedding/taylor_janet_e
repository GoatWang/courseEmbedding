Spring clean your closetMakeup in minutes – 3, 5 or 10Paris Fashion Week Fall 20175 tips to healthier hair

Spring clean your closet

April 7, 2017 by Taylor Janet 


Now that it is actually more than 30 degrees here in New York, I can truly celebrate that spring has sprung. However, with spring comes the dreaded spring cleaning. Unless you are anything like cleaning obsessed Monica Geller, you probably hate cleaning out your closet. For me, it’s a day of mourning. You mean I have to part ways with that amazing pink silk tank I only wore once to that really fun party, but haven’t worn since because it no longer fits even though I paid like $60 for it? Ugh. I really despise cleaning out my closet because I’m hit with all the feels. I feel guilty I purchased items that I never wore or only wore a handful of times. I worry that by purging my closet I will have nothing to wear. I feel overwhelmed thinking about the amount of clothing and time it will take to go through my closet and drawers.
In order to prevent myself from second guessing the process, I wanted to create something which made it easy to part ways with my beloved wardrobe. At the end of the day when I have purged the clothing no longer worthy of being part of my closet, I actually feel a sense of satisfaction. So grab those boxes, pour yourself a glass of wine and crank up the volume on your favorite album. After all, getting rid of your closet past opens up space for so many new and exciting pieces!

Makeup in minutes – 3, 5 or 10

March 27, 2017 by Taylor Janet 


A simple morning beauty routine can set the precedence for starting a less stressful day, which is why my everyday makeup routine now takes me no more than 10 minutes to complete. Leaving the house in a rush is never a good feeling or start to the day, so I always attempt to wake up early enough to get ready, make breakfast and head out the door feeling upbeat and relaxed. Now back to the real world. No matter how organized I am, it can be easy to lose track of time. I’m guilty of watching Live with Kelly a little too long or discover the subway is experiencing delays and I need to leave a few minutes earlier than expected – consequently, I have to cut my makeup routine down. After all, nobody likes the girl on the train doing her makeup.
Don’t forget to start with a clean, moisturized and sun-screened palette 🙂

Paris Fashion Week Fall 2017

March 8, 2017 by Taylor Janet 


I returned from charming Paris about two weeks ago and was so inspired by the fashion. I strolled down the infamous Champs-Élysées and Avenue George V to admire my favorite designer houses. My heart fluttered as I walked past Yves Saint Laurent, Balmain, Tom Ford and so many other designers I look to for inspiration and direction. Having been in Paris a mere two weeks ago, Paris Fashion Week Fall 2017 was even more of a treat for me.
After watching several shows, I’ve picked some of my favorite looks that lit up the runway in the city of lights.

5 tips to healthier hair

February 3, 2017 by Taylor Janet 


Lately I have received a lot of questions regarding what I do to keep my hair from being damaged. I’ll be the first to tell you my hair hasn’t always been so healthy. A few years ago it was extremely damaged from excessive heat, bad brushes, not using enough product, color assisted appointments, and of course lack of information on how to properly care for your hair – so much so that I had to cut off a good amount off to begin repairing it. Looking back, it was the best thing I’ve ever done for my locks. Since then, my hair has done a 180 and yours can too!

Winter white

December 2, 2016 by Taylor Janet 



There is nothing quite like curling up under a plush blanket in your coziest sweater to watch holiday movies while savoring a delicious cup of hot cocoa. Find my personal favorite cocoa and marshmallows here. The best kind of sweaters are the ones you can easily wear with a pair of yoga pants and then dress up for a night out. Now that Decemburrr has arrived, it is important to find a cozy sweater that will keep you warm without swallowing your entire frame.

Velvet crush

November 17, 2016 by Taylor Janet 


It’s mid-November and I really should invest in a pair of snow boots, but the fashion industry is telling me to instead splurge on a pair of velvet booties to frolick around Central Park in this fall. Incorporating a pair of these bad boys into your closet is easier than you think. Velvet looks killer when paired with the most simple of fabrics. I suggest rocking your booties with a pair of light denim jeans loosely rolled above the ankle. For a more daring look, pair the shoes with leather pants and a plain white tee. With so many colors and patterns available you are bound to find a pair that perfectly suits you. Otherwise, black velvet if you please.

Concrete jungle where dreams are made of

November 15, 2016 by Taylor Janet 



For as long as I can remember I have dreamed of living in New York City. In the children’s film Oliver & Company, the opening scene shows a box of kittens that need homes in New York. All of the kittens are chosen except Oliver. On his first night alone a storm passes through the city collapsing his box, leaving poor Oliver to fend for himself. After being chased by two large dogs and frightened from the thunder and lightning, he eventually finds shelter on a box truck tire. Oliver is taken in by a group of pups who he roams the city with and by the end of the film is rescued by sweet Jenny. This movie provides me my earliest memory of New York and I am fairly certain it is also the reason I want to rescue every stray cat or dog.
