Career[edit]
Robert Chadwick obtained his Ph.D. in anthropology from Tulane University in 1974. His dissertation, directed by Professor Robert Wauchope, was titled The Archaeology of a New World "Merchant" Culture.
As a graduate student at the University of the Americas, he participated in excavations of three Period I tombs at Yagul.[1] He went on to serve as an archeologist for the Tehuacan Archaeological-Botanical Project and as staff archeologist for the Mexican government's Teotihuacan project. Later, he taught at the University of Alberta, Calgary.[2]
Papers[edit]
His notable collection of works during his years of excavating and reconstruction at Teotihuacan and other sites contains articles, publications, analysis of the artifacts discovered, sketches, illustrations, photographs on pre-Columbian culture, and a significant catalog prepared by Chadwick of the stone, ceramic and semi-precious artifacts found in north-eastern Costa Rica.
Chadwick gave a number of his papers to Dr. Donald Robertson, of Tulane University. They were subsequently saved by his wife Martha Robertson, who recognized their value. She then turned most of them over to the Latin American Library; and the rest of the papers arrived following her death. Mr. Chadwick retired and died in New York City. His collection of unpublished articles is kept at the Latin American Library at Tulane University New Orleans, Louisiana. His last published essay was in 2013: The Olmeca-Xicallanca of Teotihuacan, Cacaxtla, and Cholula; An archaeological, ethnohistorical, and linguistic synthesis. Con una contribución de Angel García Cook, El Epiclásico en la región poblano-tlaxcalteca. Paris Monographs in American Archaeology 30. ISBN 978 1 4073 1102 9.
