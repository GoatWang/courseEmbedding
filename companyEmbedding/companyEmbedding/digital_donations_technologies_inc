Company Overview

The founders of Digital Donations, Inc. have over 30 years experience as a global provider of electronic payment processing services for online (e-commerce) and offline merchants.  Our experience in this highly competive and commoditized industry led to the development of the proprietary Digital Donations™ fundraising platform which allow non-profit organizations (herein referred to as an “NPO” or “NPOs”) to present requests for support to potential donors, as they pay for goods and services purchased at the point of sale (POS) at participating merchants, ATMs, mobile devices or online. These donation requests have the ability to reach large segments of the population.  Our fundraising / technology platforms automate the solicitation, collection, payment and reporting of these donations for NPOs. This software can be integrated into new or existing payment processing technology for companies who have a corporate giving program in place or intend to develop a new one.   As it relates to our technology, most consumers are familiar with point of the point of sale product, having experienced solicitations at check-out by a cashier (such as at PetSmart® in connection with its charity) and automatically captured through the credit card processing terminal. Our newest version of our technology includes the ability to incorporate rewards and loyalty solutions into all of our platforms.   Electronic Payment Processing Our suite of electronic payment products and services are tailored for the special business needs of our clients. Through our industry knowledge and experience, partnership strategy and new processing solutions, such as the Digital Donations platform, we provide what we believe is a unique approach to providing transaction processing solutions and credit card processing for many sectors that have high volume of transactions but are traditionally considered high risk by the banking community and have unique requirements.  This includes emerging industries such as the medical cannabis industry, specialty retail, travel, ecommerce, direct response, multi-level marketing, pharma, health care, and many other segments that fit our strategy for payment processing with integrated fundraising capabilities included.   Our Mission Our mission is to continuously develop “Alternative Payments and Fundraising Solutions” that allow consumers to make small donations as part of a financial transaction.  Our passion for helping nonprofits through non-traditional methods provides a platform for those who wish to make a difference in the communities where they transact business.

Company Description
Digital Donations is headquartered in Melville, New York. Digital Donations will
provide alternative and new fundraising solutions for NPOs and businesses
encompassing an array of techniques and technologies designed to assist large
and small nonprofits to increase their donations and lower


 costs.

Digital Donations develops and distributes creative and innovative fundraising
technologies and will provide payment processing solutions that connect
charities and foundations with the consumer and corporate America. The Digital
DonationsÔ platform will be available for integration at point of sale payment
systems, ATMs, e-commerce, mobile devices (MYGIV) and interactive rewards
crowdfunding (CROWDGIV).

Through the process of integrating a donation request as part of a financial
transaction, retailers, e-tailers and service providers will have the ability to
create a new cause marketing program or enhance their existing strategy. In
addition, the Digital Donation platform will have the ability to connect
nonprofits with corporate partnerships who have the opportunity to promote their
products / services by offering rewards to donors. Rewards are a proven method
of driving donor participation.

Digital Donations is a provider of alternative fundraising solutions for NPOs
that will allow consumers to make charitable donations as part of a financial
transaction. The cornerstone of the business is the Digital Donations
fundraising platform that will allow charities to present requests for support
to potential donors as the potential donors pay for goods and services purchased
from participating merchants, at ATMs, mobile devices (MYGIV) or online through
the CROWDGIV platform. These requests will be for amounts called micro donations
(under $10) and will have the ability to reach large segments of the population.

The Digital Donations software automates the solicitation, collection, payment
and reporting of these donations for non – profit organizations. We expect that
our software can be integrated into new or existing payment processing platforms
and can also operate as a standalone solution for companies who have a corporate
giving program in place or intend to develop a new one.

The Digital Donations suite of fundraising solutions and services will be
tailored for the special philanthropic business needs of clients. Digital
Donations provides what it believes to be a unique approach to providing
transaction processing services and credit card processing for many industries,
such as retail, specialty retail, travel and hospitality, professional sports
and fund raising events, health care, e-commerce, not-for-profit,
municipalities, utilities, online bill payments, and many more. Most consumers
are familiar with this form of fundraising technology having experienced being
solicited at check-out either by a cashier or automatically through the credit
card processing terminal.

PROSPECTUS



Subject
to Completion, Dated November 14, 2016




 

DIGITAL
DONATIONS TECHNOLOGIES, INC.

8,751,920
shares of common stock offered
by selling shareholders at $1.50 per share

 

This
prospectus relates to the offer and sale of (i) 8,751,920 shares of
common stock (the “ Shares ” ) of Digital Donations
Technologies, Inc. ( “ DDTI ” or the “ Company
” ), $.0001 par value per share by the holders thereof who
are deemed to be statutory underwriters. The shares offered by the
selling shareholders (the “Shares”) will be offered at
a price of $1.50 until the Company’s common stock is listed
on a national securities exchange or is quoted on the OTC Bulletin
Board (or a successor); after which, the selling shareholders may
sell their shares at prevailing market or privately negotiated
pries, including (without limitation) in one or more transactions
that may take place by ordinary broker’s transactions,
privately-negotiated transactions or through sales to one or more
dealers for resale.

 

The
maximum number of Shares that can be sold pursuant to the terms of
this offering by the selling shareholders is (in aggregate)
8,751,920 Shares. Funds received by the selling shareholders will
be immediately available to such selling shareholders for use by
them. The Company will not receive any proceeds from the sale of
the Selling Shareholder Shares. All costs incurred in the
registration of the Shares and the Selling Shareholder Shares are
being borne by the Company.

 

The
offering will terminate twenty-four (24) months from the date that
the registration statement relating to the Shares is declared
effective, unless earlier fully subscribed or terminated by the
Company. The Company intends to maintain the current status and
accuracy of this prospectus and to allow selling shareholders to
offer and sell the Shares for a period of up to two (2) years,
unless earlier completely sold, pursuant to Rule 415 of the General
Rules and Regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.

 

Prior to
this offering, there has been no public market for the
Company’s common stock. No assurances can be given that a
public market will develop following completion of this offering or
that, if a market does develop, it will be sustained. The offering
price for the Shares has been arbitrarily determined by the Company
and does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the
assets, operations, book or other established criteria of value of
the Company. The Shares will become tradable on the effective date
of the registration statement of which this prospectus is a
part.

 

Neither
the Company nor any selling shareholders has any current
arrangements nor entered into any agreements with any underwriters,
broker-dealers or selling agents for the sale of the Shares. If the
Company or selling shareholders can locate and enter into any such
arrangement(s), the Shares will be sold through such licensed
underwriter(s), broker-dealer(s) and/or selling
agent(s).

  PROSPECTUS
SUMMARY

 

This
summary highlights some information from this prospectus, and it
may not contain all the information important to making an
investment decision. A potential investor should read the following
summary together with the more detailed information regarding the
Company and the common stock being sold in this offering, including
“Risk Factors” and the financial statements and related
notes, included elsewhere in this prospectus.

 

The
Company

 

History

 

Digital
Donations Technologies, Inc., formerly known as Fishing Ridge
Acquisition Corporation ( “ DDTI ” or the “
Company ” ), was incorporated in Delaware on May 21, 2015 and
filed a registration statement on Form 10 with the Securities and
Exchange Commission on July 28, 2015 and became a public reporting
company sixty days thereafter.

 

In
January, 2016, Fishing Ridge Acquisition Corporation changed its
name to Digital Donations Technologies, Inc. pursuant to a change
of control with the resignation of the then officers and directors,
redemption of 19,500,000 shares of the 20,000,000 outstanding
shares of its common stock, the appointment of new officers and
directors and the issuance of 5,000,000 shares of common stock, pro
rata, to the new shareholders of the Company.

 

On October
17, 2016 DDTI effected the acquisition of Digital Donations, Inc.,
a New York corporation ( “ Digital Donations ” ) (the
“ Acquisition ” ) as a wholly-owned subsidiary with the
issuance of 79,084,807shares of its common stock in exchange for
the 79,084,807 outstanding shares of common stock of Digital
Donations Inc.

 

Prior to
the Acquisition, the Company had no business or operations.
Pursuant to the Acquisition, the Company acquired the business
plan, operations and contracts of its now wholly-owned subsidiary,
Digital Donations, Inc. ( “ Digital Donations ” ).
Throughout the disclosure contained herein reference to the Company
includes that information of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Digital
Donations, as appropriate particularly in regard to financial
information and operations.

 


Business

 

DDTI is an
early-stage company formed to support the non-profit industry with
innovative and cost effective fundraising technologies providing
alternative payment and fundraising solutions giving consumers the
option to make a small donation as part of a financial transaction
such as at a checkout or ATM transaction. The Company is currently
developing fundraising platforms which allow non-profit
organizations (“NPO”) to present requests for
contributions to potential donors at the time such possible donors
pay for goods and services at the point of sale (“POS”)
at participating merchants, ATM’s, mobile devices or via the
Company’s online web site.

 

Risks and
Uncertainties facing the Company

 

As a
development stage company, the Company has no operating history and
has experienced losses since its inception. The Company’s
independent auditors have issued a report questioning the
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. That is,
the Company needs to create a source of revenue or locate
additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans.
As a development stage company, management of the Company has no
prior experience in building and selling projects similar to that
planned by the Company and in marketing and distributing such
projects on a broad scale.

 

One of the
biggest challenges facing the Company is the ability to raise
adequate capital to develop and execute project opportunities in
the nonprofit fund-raising technology industry.

 

Due to
financial constraints, the Company has to date conducted limited
operations. If the Company were unable to develop strong and
reliable sources of funding for project opportunities, it is
unlikely that the Company could develop its operations to return
revenue sufficient to further develop its business plan. Moreover,
the above assumes that the Company’s efforts are met with
customer satisfaction in the marketplace and exhibit steady
adoption of its solutions amongst the potential base of customers,
neither of which are currently known or guaranteed.

Trading
Market

 

Currently,
there is no trading market for the securities of the Company. The
Company intends to initially apply for admission to quotation of
its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board as soon as possible which
may be while this offering is still in process. There can be no
assurance that the Company will qualify for quotation of its
securities on the OTC Bulletin Board.

 


The
Offering

 

The
maximum number of Shares that can be sold pursuant to the terms of
this offering is 8,751,920. The offering will terminate twenty-four
(24) months from the date of this prospectus unless earlier
terminated by the Company.

 

This
prospectus relates to the offer and sale of 8,751,920 shares of
common stock of Digital Donations Technologies, Inc. offered by the
holders thereof who are deemed to be statutory underwriters. The
selling shareholders will offer their shares at a price of $1.50
until such time as the Shares are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board
and only thereafter at prevailing market or privately negotiated
prices in one or more transactions that may take place by ordinary
broker’s transactions, privately-negotiated transactions or
through sales to one or more dealers for resale or at prevailing
market if a market should develop.

(1) Based
on number of shares outstanding as of the date of this
prospectus.

 

In the
future, following the completion of this offering, the Company will
most likely need to raise capital for the projects which it
anticipates to develop. The Company anticipates that it may raise
such capital by an offering of its shares of common stock. If the
Company does effect equity offerings of its securities and if the
price paid for shares offered in such an offering is less than paid
by the purchasers of Shares, then such purchasers will suffer a
dilution in the value of their shares. Furthermore the issuance of
such additional shares may impact the ability of any investor to
sell their Shares once such shares are eligible for sale. The
Company cannot anticipate that it will be able to effect such
additional offerings of its securities and then failure of it to do
so may severely impact its available capital to develop any
transportation systems or further its business plan.

 


  RISK
FACTORS

 

A purchase
of any Shares is an investment in the Company’s common stock
and involves a high degree of risk. Investors should consider
carefully the following information about these risks, together
with the other information contained in the registration statement
of which this prospectus is a part, before the purchase of any
Shares. If any of the following risks actually occur, the business,
financial condition or results of operations of the Company would
likely suffer, the market price of the common stock would likely
decline, and investors could lose all or a portion of their
investment. The Company has listed the following risk factors which
it believes to be those material to an investment decision in this
offering.

 

 




– 
4  –




  

 

The
Company has limited operating history through its
subsidiary.

 

The
Company is a development stage company and has limited operating
history. The Company is relying on management to actuate and
develop its business plan through its operating subsidiary. The
Company’s subsidiary has limited business history and an
investor will be required to make an investment decision based
largely on the management and the projected operations in light of
the risks, expenses and uncertainties that may be encountered by
engaging in the technological development and marketing of
platforms for use in charitable donations at the time of electronic
transactions.

 

The
Company’s independent auditors have issued a report
questioning the Company’s ability to continue as a going
concern.

 

The notes
contained in the financial statements of the Company’s wholly
owned subsidiary, Digital Donations, for the year ended December
31, 2015 include a paragraph that explains that Digital Donations
has incurred operating losses since inception and at December 31,
2015 had an accumulated deficit of $430,804 and incurred a net loss
of $304,751. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent on the Company’s ability to fund future
operations through additional financing from investors and/or
lenders or through the sale of its securities or through
development of its operations. Due to these and other factors, the
Company ’ s independent auditors have issued a report raising
substantial doubt of the Company ’ s ability to continue as a
going concern.

 

As of June
30, 2016, the Company has accumulated deficit of
$587,876.

 

As of June
30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $587,876 and in
incurred a net loss of $157,072 during the six months ended June
30, 2016. This deficit may impact on the Company in various ways
including, but not limited to, making it more difficult to borrow
money, sell stock or to maintain a good market price.

 

The
Company may not be able to meet its outstanding loan
obligation

 

The
Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary executed promissory notes
totaling a principal amount of $30,000 payable 180 days from date
of execution with interest at 24% per annum. Interest is payable
quarterly. Without the influx of additional capital, the Company
will not be able to meet the payment obligations for these loans
when they become due. If the Company is not able to pay such
obligations nor obtain a waiver or delay, it may face serious
dissolution demands.

 

In order
to continue operations the Company has undertaken a private
offering of its securities in order to raise necessary
funds.

 

In order
to raise necessary funds to continue operations and meet its
obligations, the Company is offering up to 5,000,000 shares of its
common stock at a per share price of $1.00. The Company has
initially sold shares at $.07 per share. There is no assurance that
the Company can raise additional funds through its offering and
without such influx of such capital, or without capital from other
sources such as loans or debt offering, the Company may not be able
to continue operations.

 

Investors
in the offering will experience immediate dilution of the value of
their shares.

 

Purchasers
of the Shares will experience immediate dilution in the value of
their Shares. Dilution represents the difference between the price
per share paid by investors ($1.50) and the net tangible book value
per share immediately after completion of the Offering. Net
tangible book value per share is the net tangible assets of the
Company (total assets less total liabilities less intangible
assets), divided by the number of shares of common stock
outstanding. At June 30, 2016, the Company’s net tangible per
share book value was $0.0. Thus if at some other time, shares had
been sold by the Company at a price less than the $1.50 paid by
purchasers of the Shares or had been issued by the Company for
services or as other non-cash consideration, then the value of such
investor Shares immediately after purchase would be less than the
purchase price. The Company has issued shares prior to the date of
this prospectus at a price less than $1.50. In addition, the
Company is currently offering up to 5,000,000 shares of its common
stock at a price of $1.00 per share and has sold approximately
349,993 shares at an average approximate price of $.07 per share.
The issuance of any shares pursuant to such private offering will
immediately dilute the value of the Shares paid by investors
pursuant to this prospectus. The Company anticipates issuing up to
15,000,000 shares of its common stock in an asset purchase. If the
value of those assets are such that the value of the 15,000,000
shares is less than $1.50, then investors will experience
additional dilution.

 

 




– 
5  –




  

 

The
offering price of the Shares has been arbitrarily determined and
such price should not be used by an investor as an indicator of the
fair market value of the Shares.

 

Currently
there is no public market for the Company’s common stock. The
offering price for the Shares has been arbitrarily determined and
does not necessarily bear any direct relationship to the assets,
operations, book or other established criteria of value of the
Company. Thus an investor should be aware that the offering price
does not reflect the fair market price of the Shares.

 

In order
to actuate its business plan and further develop its technology,
the Company will need additional capital

 

The
Company will not receive any funds from the sale of the Shares
offered herein and will require capital by loans, joint ventures or
sale of its securities in order to execute its current business
plan, namely to further develop the technology of its platforms for
consumer donations at electronic transaction sites such as ATMs,
checkout machines and web sites, If the Company were unable to
locate such financing on terms acceptable to the Company, it is
unlikely that the Company could develop its operations to return
revenue sufficient to further develop its business plan.

 

No
assurance of commercial feasibility.

 

Even if
the Company’s plans and projects are successfully initiated,
there can be no assurance that such plans and projects will have
any commercial success or advantage. Also, there is no assurance
that the Company’s initiatives will perform as intended in
the marketplace.

 

The
Company’s developed software may experience unexpected
“bugs” which may delay its release or impede its
use.

 

The
Company is developing its proprietary software and intends to
effect beta and other testing to ensure efficient launch and
usability. However, the Company’s software may experience or
develop unanticipated “bugs” that would either delay
its release or impede its use once released. Such delays or
problems could impact the Company’s ability to generate
revenue or could negatively affect any contractual relationships
with users of the software.

 

There has
been no prior public market for the Company’s common stock
and the lack of such a market may make resale of the Shares
difficult.

 

No prior
public market has existed for the Company’s securities and
the Company cannot assure any purchaser that a market will develop
subsequent to this offering. The Company intends to apply for
quotation of its common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board when
appropriate. However, the Company does not know if it will be
successful in such application, how long such application will
take, or, if successful, that a market for the common stock will
ever develop or continue on that or any other trading market. If
for any reason a trading market for the Shares does not develop,
investors may have difficulty selling their common stock should
they desire to do so.

 

The
Company’s election not to opt out of JOBS Act extended
accounting transition period may not make its financial statements
easily comparable to other companies.

 

Pursuant
to the JOBS Act of 2012, as an emerging growth company the Company
can elect to opt out of the extended transition period for any new
or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the PCAOB or
the SEC. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended
transition period which means that when a standard is issued or
revised and it has different application dates for public or
private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can
adopt the standard for the private company. This may make
comparison of the Company’s financial statements with any
other public company which is not either an emerging growth company
nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the
extended transition period difficult or impossible as possible
different or revised standards may be used.

The
Company’s stock may be considered a penny stock and any
investment in the Company’s stock will be considered a
high-risk investment and subject to restrictions on
marketability.

 

If the
Shares commence trading, the trading price of the Company’s
common stock may be below $5.00 per Share. If the price of the
common stock is below such level, trading in its common stock would
be subject to the requirements of certain rules promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These rules
require additional disclosure by broker-dealers in connection with
any trades generally involving any non-NASDAQ equity security that
has a market price of less than $5.00 per Share, subject to certain
exceptions. Such rules require the delivery, before any penny stock
transaction, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock
market and the risks associated therewith, and impose various sales
practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell penny stocks to
persons other than established customers and accredited investors
(generally institutions). For these types of transactions, the
broker-dealer must determine the suitability of the penny stock for
the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s written consent to
the transactions before sale. The additional burdens imposed upon
broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers
from effecting transactions in the Company’s common stock
which could impact the liquidity of the Company’s common
stock.

 

The Board
of Directors could use the issuance or designation of preferred
stock to impede or discourage an acquisition of the Company that
may otherwise be beneficial to some shareholders.

 

The
issuance of shares of preferred stock, or the issuance of rights to
purchase such shares, could be used to discourage an unsolicited
acquisition proposal. For instance, the issuance of a series of
preferred stock might impede a business combination by including
class voting rights that would enable the holder to block such a
transaction, or facilitate a business combination by including
voting rights that would provide a required percentage vote of the
stockholders. In addition, under certain circumstances, the
issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power
of the holders of the common stock. Although the Company’s
board of directors is required to make any determination to issue
such preferred stock based on its judgment as to the best interests
of the stockholders of the Company, the board of directors could
act in a manner that would discourage an acquisition attempt or
other transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders
might believe to be in their best interests or in which
stockholders might receive a premium for their stock over the then
market price of such stock. The board of directors does not intend
to seek stockholder approval prior to any issuance of currently
authorized stock, unless otherwise required by law or
otherwise.

 

The
Company relies on only key managers whose absence or loss could
adversely affect the business.

 

The
Company relies on the services of its two key executives. The loss
of the services of either such manager could adversely affect the
business.

 

Costs
incurred because the Company is a public company may affect the
Company’s profitability.

 

As a
public company, the Company incurs significant legal, accounting,
and other expenses, and the Company is subject to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to
public disclosure that generally involve a substantial expenditure
of financial resources. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC,
requires changes in corporate governance practices of public
companies. The Company expects that full compliance with such rules
and regulations will significantly increase the Company’s
legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more
time-consuming and costly, which may negatively impact the
Company’s financial results. To the extent the
Company’s earnings suffer as a result of the financial impact
of the Company’s SEC reporting or compliance costs, the
Company’s ability to develop an active trading market for the
Company’s securities could be harmed.

 

The
Company has a small financial and accounting organization. Being a
public company strains the Company’s resources, diverts
management’s attention and affects its ability to attract and
retain qualified officers and directors.

 

As a
reporting company, the Company is already subject to the reporting
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. However, the
requirements of these laws and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder entail significant accounting, legal and
financial compliance costs which are potentially prohibitive to the
Company as it develops its business plan, products and scope. These
costs have made, and will continue to make, some activities more
difficult, time consuming or costly and may place significant
strain on its personnel, systems and resources.

The
Securities Exchange Act requires, among other things, that
companies maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain the
requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting, significant resources and management
oversight are required. As a result, management’s attention
may be diverted from other business concerns, which could have a
material adverse effect on the development of the Company’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

 


  FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS

 

This
prospectus contains, in addition to historical information, certain
information, assumptions and discussions that may constitute
forward-looking statements. Such statements are subject to certain
risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ
materially than those projected or anticipated. Actual results
could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements. Although the Company believes its assumptions
underlying the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the
Company cannot assure an investor that the forward-looking
statements set out in this prospectus will prove to be
accurate.

 

Such
“forward-looking statements” can be identified by the
use of forward-looking terminology such as “believes”,
“expects”, “may”, “should” or
“anticipates”, or the negative thereof, or other
variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussion of
strategy. No assurance can be given that the future results covered
by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. The following
matters constitute cautionary statements identifying important
factors with respect to such forward-looking statements, including
certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results
to vary materially from the future results covered in such
forward-looking statements.

 

An
investor should not rely on forward-looking statements as
predictions of future events. The events and circumstances
reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or
occur. The Company is not under a duty to update any of these
forward-looking statements after the date of this prospectus or to
conform these statements to actual results or revised
expectations.

 

  DETERMINATION
OF OFFERING PRICE

 

There is
no public market for the Company’s common stock and the $1.50
price at which the Shares are being offered has been arbitrarily
determined by the Company.

 

The Shares
offered by the selling shareholders may be offered and sold, from
time to time, by the selling shareholders described in this
prospectus under the heading “Selling Shareholders” at
an offering price of $1.50 per share until such time as the Shares
are quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board and only thereafter may be
offered at prevailing market or privately negotiated prices. The
selling shareholders may sell the Shares by any means described in
this prospectus under “Plan of
Distribution.”

 


  DIVIDEND
POLICY

 

The
Company does not anticipate that it will declare dividends in the
foreseeable future but rather intends to use any future earnings
for the development of its business. The Company’s board of
directors may determine at some future date to declare dividends
based on results of operations, financial condition, contractual
restrictions, applicable law and other factors deemed relevant by
the Board. Such dividend declaration is not currently
contemplated.

 


 DILUTION

 

 

 

If you
invest in our common stock in this offering, your ownership
interest will be immediately diluted to the extent of the
difference between the initial public offering price per share and
the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of our
common stock after this offering.

 

As of June
30, 2016, we had a historical net tangible book value (deficit) of
$(46,407), or $(0.00) per share of common stock, based on
84,934,800 shares of common stock currently outstanding. Our
historical net tangible book value represents total tangible assets
less total liabilities at June 30, 2016. From July 1, 2016 through
the date of this prospectus, our wholly owned subsidiary raised
cash proceeds of $150,000 through the issuance of its common stock
and notes payable. The shares issued by our subsidiary are included
in the share count noted above. After adjusting for these cash
proceeds and common stock and note issuances, our pro forma as
adjusted net tangible book value as of June 30, 2016 is $73,593, or
$0.00 per share.

 

Dilution
per share to new investors is determined by subtracting pro forma
as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering
from the initial public offering price per share paid by new
investors. The following table illustrates this
dilution:

A $1.00
increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of
$1.50 per share would have no effect on the dilution per share to
new investors.

 

The
following table sets forth, on an as adjusted basis, the difference
between the number of shares of common stock purchased from us, the
total consideration paid, and the average price per share paid by
our existing stockholders and the average price to be paid by new
investors in this public offering before deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us, using an assumed public offering price of
$1.50 per share of common stock. The total consideration paid by
existing stockholders set forth below, $407,500 consists of cash
consideration for our equity. The table does not include shares
that we issued for services provided or for the acquisition of
certain tangible assets.

  DESCRIPTION
OF SECURITIES

 


Capitalization

 

Pursuant
to the Company’s certificate of incorporation and amendments
thereto, the Company is authorized to issue 300,000,000 shares of
common stock, par value $0.0001, of which 84,934,800shares were
outstanding as of the date of the registration statement, of which
this prospectus is a part. The Company is also authorized to issue
100,000,000 share of preferred stock, par value $0.0001, of which
none are designated or outstanding.

 

Common
Stock

 

The
Company is registering 8,751,920 shares of common stock offered for
sale to the public by the holders thereof (selling shareholders) at
an offering price of $1.50 per share. The selling shareholders will
offer the Shares at $1.50 until such time as the Shares are quoted
on the OTC Bulletin Board and offered thereafter by the selling
shareholders at prevailing market or privately negotiated prices
including (without limitation) in one or more transactions that may
take place by ordinary broker’s transactions,
privately-negotiated transactions or through sales to one or more
dealers for resale or at prevailing market prices if a market
should develop.

 

Holders of
shares of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share on
all matters to be voted on by the stockholders. Holders of common
stock do not have cumulative voting rights. In addition to any vote
required by law, the consent of at least a majority of the holders
of the then-outstanding shares of common stock is required to (I)
redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any share of common stock,
(ii) increase or decrease (other than by redemption or conversion)
the total number of authorized shares of common stock; or (iii)
amend the Articles of Incorporation of the Company if such
amendment would change any of the rights, preferences or privileges
of the common stock.

 

Subject to
preferences that may be applicable to any outstanding shares of
preferred stock if any such preferred stock is designated and
issued, the holders of common stock are entitled to share ratably
in dividends, if any, as may be declared from time to time by the
board of directors in its discretion from funds legally available
therefor. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up,
subject to the rights of the shares of preferred stock if so
designated and issued, the holders of common stock are entitled to
share pro rata all assets remaining after payment in full of all
liabilities including the promissory notes issued by the
Company.

 

Holders of
common stock have no preemptive rights to purchase the
Company’s common stock. There are no conversion or redemption
rights or sinking fund provisions with respect to the common stock.
The Company may issue additional shares of common stock which could
dilute its current shareholder’s share value.

 

Preferred
Stock

 

Shares of
preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more
series as may be determined by the board of directors. The voting
powers and preferences, the relative rights of each series, and the
qualifications, limitations, and restrictions on such preferred
stock shall be established by the board of directors, except that
no holder of preferred stock shall have preemptive
rights.

 

Admission
to Quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board

 

If and
when the Company meets the qualifications, it intends to apply for
quotation of its securities on the OTC Bulletin Board. There is no
assurance that the Company will ever meet such qualifications. The
OTC Bulletin Board differs from national and regional stock
exchanges in that it (1) is not situated in a single location but
operates through communication of bids, offers and confirmations
between broker-dealers and (2) securities admitted to quotation are
offered by one or more broker-dealers rather than the
“specialist” common to stock exchanges. To qualify for
quotation on the OTC Bulletin Board, an equity security must have
one registered broker-dealer, known as the market maker, willing to
list bid or sale quotations and to sponsor the company
listing.

Penny
Stock Regulation

 

Penny
stocks generally are equity securities with a price of less than
$5.00 per share other than securities registered on national
securities exchanges or listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market, provided
that current price and volume information with respect to
transactions in such securities are provided by the exchange or
system. The penny stock rules impose additional sales practice
requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons
other than established customers and accredited investors
(generally those with assets in excess of $1,000,000 or annual
income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse).
For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must
make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such
securities and have received the purchaser’s written consent
to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any
transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules
require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a disclosure
schedule prescribed by the SEC relating to the penny stock market.
The broker-dealer also must disclose the commissions payable to
both the broker-dealer and the registered representative and
current quotations for the securities. Finally, monthly statements
must be sent disclosing recent price information on the limited
market in penny stocks. Because of these penny stock rules,
broker-dealers may be restricted in their ability to sell the
Company’s common stock. The foregoing required penny stock
restrictions will not apply to the Company’s common stock if
such stock reaches and maintains a market price of $5.00 per share
or greater.

 

Dividends

 

The
Company has not paid any dividends to date. The Company intends to
employ all available funds for the growth and development of its
business, and accordingly, does not intend to declare or pay any
dividends in the foreseeable future.

The
Digital Donations software automates the solicitation, collection,
payment and reporting of these donations for non – profit
organizations. The software can be integrated into new or existing
payment processing platforms or can operate as a standalone
solution for companies who have a corporate giving program in place
or intend to develop a new one.

 

The
Digital Donations suite of fundraising solutions and services are
tailored for the special philanthropic business needs of clients.
Digital Donations provides what it believes to be a unique approach
to providing transaction processing services and credit card
processing for many industries, such as retail, specialty retail,
travel and hospitality, professional sports and fund raising
events, health care, e-commerce, not-for-profit, municipalities,
utilities, online bill payments, and many more. Most consumers are
familiar with this form of fundraising technology having
experienced being solicited at check-out either by a cashier or
automatically through the credit card processing
terminal).

 

Digital
Donation Technology Platform

 

The
Digital Donation ’ s technology can be applied to a variety
of hardware devices, digital / mobile platforms, credit card
payment terminals and ATMs that are used by numerous merchants,
including retail stores, restaurants and banks.

 

When a
customer makes a purchase at a merchant (Point of Sale), online,
with a mobile device or a withdrawal at an ATM and uses a credit or
debit card, the Digital Donations system presents the opportunity
on the payment screen to donate to a charity. If the customer
selects “ yes ” on the screen, several dollar amounts
are presented for the customer ’ s selection, including a
roundup and the option to choose “ another amount ” .
Once the amount of the donation is approved, a receipt is printed
for the customer showing the amount donated and, the name of the
NPO to which the contribution was made. This receipt, provided
either in hard copy or electronically, is the donor ’ s
documentary evidence of their tax-deductible charitable
contribution.

 

Point of
Sale : Point of
sale technology provides a donation request at the time a consumer
completes the sale of goods or services – at the point of
purchase/sale. This is a familiar technique seen at many store
checkouts such as grocery, gas or clothing stores. This technology
allows charities to present requests for support to potential
donors as such potential donors pay for goods and services
purchased from merchant.

 

ATM
Fundraising : As
Digital Donations continues in providing “ alternative
fundraising solutions ” , it is one of the first companies to
develop fundraising technology for the ATM industry at large. With
ATMs offering such items as postage stamps, lottery tickets, and
gift cards, Digital Donations determined to integrate fundraising
technology into ATMs. An optional instant incentive program will
provide advertisers / sponsors the ability to provide their offers
and discounts to those who donate via on screen ads, mobile
messaging, custom ATM wraps and by printing their offer on the
customer receipt.

 

MYGIV
(mobile
device donation app): The myGIV mobile app developed by Digital
Donations utilizes location based search and marketing
(geo-targeting) and gamification (scratch off game) to deliver
valuable rewards to consumers that make a small donation to a
charitable cause. Registered myGIV users will have access to offers
provided by retailers, restaurants and service providers where they
can play, win and donate to redeem their reward. By connecting
merchant rewards with a charitable cause it creates a mutual
benefit for the donor, the cause and the merchant. myGIV works with
local, regional and national businesses to develop new customers
and retain existing ones through cause related marketing
initiatives.

CROWDGIV
(a
crowdfunding technique), is a method of fundraising in which a
large number of individuals are solicited to finance a new business
venture or a charitable cause. Crowdfunding makes use of the easy
accessibility of vast networks of friends, family and colleagues
through social media networks like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn
to get the word out about a fundraising campaign.

 

The
Digital Donation ’ s CROWDGIV platform provides easy to
navigate, “ smart interface ” , and allows for instant
donation acceptance before, during or after viewing videos and the
ability to share on multiple social networks with one click. A
client can also send out individual or group emails by syncing its
own contact list. Another unique part of the Digital Donation
’ s CROWDGIV platform is the ability to connect nonprofits
with corporate partnerships who have the opportunity to promote
their products / services by offering rewards to donors. Rewards
are a proven method of driving donor participation.

 

Unlike
the majority of crowdfunding sites, CROWDGIV ’ s model
focuses solely on nonprofit fundraising. The platform allows
individuals, nonprofits and corporate entities to set up
fundraising campaigns on behalf of any qualified charitable,
religious or educational organization they wish to support. A major
part of the growth plan for CrowdGIV is extending the platform to
offer individuals the ability to raise funds for personal needs
similar to a GOFUNDME model.

 

As in
most crowdfunding platforms, a user can select team fundraising
which allows a non-profit or business to set up a master campaign
and then invite others to set up sub-campaigns, (their own page)
and set their own goals that feed the total objective of the master
campaign. Each of these campaigns can be easily marketed to
friends, family members and colleagues through social sharing,
email or text, linking the request for a donation directly to your
campaign page.

 

There are
no costs to setup a campaign on CROWDGIV and no minimum fundraising
requirements. Campaign costs are based on a number of factors which
include credit card processing fees, platform and fundraising
costs.

 

The
Digital Donations Pledge

 

Digital
Donations has credited The Digital Donations Pledge which it
believes separates it from the others in the fundraising industry.
The Digital Donations Pledge provides that any 501c3 in good
standing that meets the requirements can apply for a minimum $5,000
in-kind donation pledge from Digital Donations. The non-profit
organization can immediately use the donation to purchase products
and services from Digital Donations at the lowest cost for any
product or service offered by Digital Donations.

Credit
Card Payment Processing

 

The
Company believes that the commoditization of the credit card
processing industry has created an opportunity to utilize merchant
accounts as part of an overall strategy for growth.

 

Digital
Donations has entered into an agreement with WorldPay, a
multi-national payment processing company, which affords it
national account preferred pricing as a Visa-approved Payment
Service Provider (PSP). WorldPay is the largest provider of ATM
services in the United States www.worldpay.us.

 

The
Company plans to combine this preferred pricing with the Digital
Donations platform to create a new revenue stream for targeted
accounts. Digital Donations has already entered into processing
agreements with the American Cancer Society, American Heart
Association, National Multiple Sclerosis, The Humane Society of the
United States, Alzheimer ’ s Foundation and Morgan Stanley.
These charities utilize the Company ’ s ATM fundraising
technology and are presented as a fundraising opportunity to a
consumer as that consumer withdraws cash from an ATM. Donations are
collected by the Company and dispersed to the charity selected by
the consumer. The Company bills each charity for its services and
processing fees.

 

In
addition, Messenger, a 100-year-old company that provides products
and services to over 20,000 funeral homes across the U.S., has been
working with Digital Donations to develop an application for a
kiosk to accept donations at funeral services utilizing the Digital
Donations platform.

 

As the
Digital Donations business evolved, instead of focusing efforts on
acquiring traditional credit card processing accounts Digital
Donations chose to partner with major processing companies, ATM
manufacturers / distributors with an existing base of customers and
charities that provide access to major retailers and corporations
that fit our target profile. With the development of Digital
Donations as a “ Processor Independent “ solution we
now have the ability to integrate our technology into accounts
where previously there was minimal opportunity for the company to
capture a merchants processing business. This provides us with the
ability to sell our solutions to accounts regardless of who they
use as a processor.

 

Current
contracts

 

The
Company ’ s plan for success revolves around strategic
agreements with NPOs, payment processors, integration partners, ATM
manufacturers, distributors, mobile platforms and direct response
companies. Working closely with NPOs and their corporate sponsors,
many of which are merchants and service providers, the opportunity
exists to integrate the Digital Donations platform into their
point-of-sale systems, e-commerce shopping carts, ATMs and mobile
devices that are capable of utilizing the Digital Donations
technology.

 

United
Charitable. United
Charitable (UC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization whose mission
is to make philanthropy accessible by providing comprehensive
management of charitable programs and donor-advised foundations on
a community, national, or global level. United Charitable serves as
an umbrella organization for individuals or entities which are
generally so small that they lack the infrastructure to run their
non-profit. The Company , though its subsidiary Digital Donations,
Inc., entered into an agreement in June 2014 to provide to the
merchants within each of UC ’ s 500+ Programs access to the
Digital Donations Ô fundraising
technology. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement the Company will
work with selected merchants and use the Digital Donations Software
to automate the solicitation, collection and delivery of charitable
contributions to United Charitable at approved merchant
locations.

 

Nautilus
Hyosung. Nautilus
Hyosung America is a subsidiary of South Korea Hyosung, Inc., a
global leader in providing ATMs to the retail off-premises and
financial institution markets. Since entering the North American
market in 1998, Nautilus Hyosung America has shipped more than
200,000 ATMs and is the largest provider of ATMs in the United
States. Nautilus Hyosung America is headquartered in Irving, Texas
and has research and development support in its Global Software
Center in Dayton, Ohio. In February, 2015, the Company, though its
subsidiary Digital Donations, Inc., entered into a renewable
three-year license agreement with Nautilus whereby the Company
granted Nautilus the non0exclusive license to use the Company
’ s fundraising software technology and the Company ’ s
trademark for ATM locations and ATM distributors.

WorldPay.
WorldPay
is a global card payment acquiring business with 450,000 merchants
in the United States and operating in over 30 countries around the
globe. WorldPay ’ s platforms allow customers to accept card
payments both at point-of-sale and over the Internet. WorldPay is
the largest provider of ATM services in the United States. The
Company, through its subsidiary Digital Donations, Inc., entered
into a processing agreement with WorldPay whereby WorldPay will
provide authorization, electronic draft capture, submission of
transactions to payment networks, and additional related services
for sales originated by the Company.

 

Triton
Manufacturing. With more
than 200,000 ATMs shipped in over 24 countries worldwide, (130,000
in the United States) Triton has been a leader in ATM affordability
and service for over 30 years. Digital Donations recently launched
a national effort with Triton to allow charitable giving on ATMs
currently in the marketplace. Through its subsidiary, Digital
Donations, the Company entered into an agreement whereby Triton
Systems of Delaware would act as an independent sales contractor in
selling and marketing the Company ’ s fundraising and
marketing platform. In addition Triton has appoint the Company as
the exclusive provider of ATM fundraising technology and services
on all Triton ATMS.

 

Revenues

 

Revenue is
derived directly from the funds that are raised through the use of
the Digital Donations technology and fundraising fees charged to
the charity, credit card processing fees and products and services
provided through the Pledge.

 

Fundraising
service fees are expected to be determined by several factors
including the number of retail locations and charities using the
technology, volume of transactions and amount of donations
processed on behalf of the charity. Payment processing income is
determined by the amount charged to the business above the cost of
processing (Interchange) which is determined by Visa/MasterCard,
AMEX and Discover.

 

One
hundred percent of funds received is deposited with the
Company’s fiscal sponsor (United Charitable) which is
responsible for managing all aspects of compliance and of
forwarding donations to the chosen charity. Digital
Donation’s professional fundraising and compliance management
fees for NPO technology based revenues are billed to and paid by
the NPO. This is accomplished without any up-front cost to the
charity or impact on its personnel, and in most cases at a service
fee that is well within non-profit industry parameters, as it
directly relates to the cost of the funds raised.

 

In all its
fundraising programs, Digital Donation is paid strictly on the
success of the program’s ability to generate
donations.

The
Market: Fundraising Services

 

According
to the National Center on Charitable Statistics there are estimated
to be over 1.5 million nonprofits in the United States. The Company
believes that many of these nonprofits struggle to keep their doors
open and lights on. With advances in technology there is a constant
demand for every donated dollar leaving smaller nonprofits with
limited resources behind the   curve in implementing current
technology trends. Nonprofits that don ’ t have the bandwidth
or   funding to establish a strong digital presence may be
missing critical tools. Online   marketing   can raise
  money and awareness and draw the   attention of
potential funding sources.

 

The
Company believes there is a considerable need for alternative
fundraising solutions in the United States. In today ’ s
uncertain economy NPOs are faced with the burden of reaching their
fundraising goals with reduced opportunities and at costs that
continue to rise, and are difficult to justify, causing fundraisers
to look for new and alternative ways to seek donations for their
organizations.

 

Point of
Sale: In 2015,
Cause Marketing Forum reported that more than $358 million was
raised by 63 point of sale programs. The Company believes that the
market for Digital Donations software is significant, as it has
been developed to integrate into the majority of payment terminals
manufactured by Verison, Equinox and Ingenico, which are the top
three manufacturers in the world. Of this group, Verifone is the
largest and manages payment acceptance in over 60% of our nation
’ s retailers.

 

ATMs:
One of the
key components to creating brand awareness and distribution for the
Digital Donations fundraising suite has been the exclusive
contracts with ATM manufacturers and distributors which provide a
unique opportunity to create national exposure for the Digital
Donations brand and the ability to accept donations for up to seven
charities at any given time including the ability to respond to
local, regional or global disasters immediately.

 

The
Company believes that American consumers are relying on cash
machines more than ever before and a great majority of consumers
use ATM terminals as part of their everyday banking activity. An
ATM machine can be found on almost every city block or in every
grocery or market in the United States and most developed
countries. The Company believes ATM donations fit perfectly into a
non-profits evolving approach to donors and the evolution of the
Digital Donations Ô suite of
solutions.

 

Crowdfunding
:
The Company believes that crowdfunding is poised to become a
super-large industry by 2025 and increasing numbers of charitable
organizations are looking to the power of the internet to fund
their efforts. According to Bob Mulholland’s
article Crowdfunding in the Modern Fundraising Platform:
“Crowdfunded campaigns succeed in large part because of
incentives that organizations promise in exchange for
donations.”

 

Products
in Development

 

PAYGIV
Ô

(alternative payment solution): PAYGIV Ô is an
alternative payments solution that is designed to reduce the costs
of processing and allow consumers to discreetly donate to a charity
of their choice by simply using PAYGIV as a payment option when
making a purchase or donation. Donors can also enable their
accounts to automatically “ roundup ” a purchase to the
nearest dollar or to set a fixed donation amount per month and send
that amount directly to the nonprofit that they chose when
registering their account. Merchants that accept PAYGIV will be
able to utilize the Digital Donations rewards program or tie this
activity to an existing rewards / loyalty program gaining an
additional benefit for all parties.

 

PAYGIV
Ô
Digital
Wallet . The
Company is also developing a PAYGIV Ô digital
wallet (e-wallet) which would allow consumers to register multiple
credit/debit cards and bank account numbers that can be stored
securely, eliminating the need to enter account information when
transacting online or at the point of sale removing the need to
carry credit or debit cards in order to make a purchase and
donate.

Emerging
Growth Company

 

Digital
Donations Technologies, Inc., qualifies as an “ emerging
growth company ” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business
Startups Act which became law in April, 2012. The definition of an
“ emerging growth company ” is a company with an
initial public offering of common equity securities which occurred
after December 8, 2011 and has less than $1 billion of total annual
gross revenues during last completed fiscal year. The disclosure
regarding the company and The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
is incorporated herein by reference from the Form 10-12G filed on
July 28, 2015.

Jumpstart
Our Business Startups Act

 

In April,
2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS
Act”) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among
other things: Exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain
financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five
years and provides a new form of financing to small companies;
Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to
simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number
of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; Relaxation of the general
solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506
offerings; Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of
securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and Exemption from
registration by a non-reporting company offers and sales of
securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted
by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and such
sales are exempt from state law registration, documentation or
offering requirements. In general, under the JOBS Act a company is
an emerging growth company if its initial public offering
(“IPO”) of common equity securities was effected after
December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total
annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A
company will not longer qualify as an emerging growth company after
the earliest of

 

(i) the
completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual
gross revenues of $1 billion or more,

(ii) the
completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the
company’s IPO;

(iii) the
company’s issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible
debt in the prior three-year period; or

(iv) the
company becoming a “larger accelerated filer” as
defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

 

The
Company meets the definition of an emerging growth company will be
affected by some of the changes provided in the JOBS Act and
certain of the new exemptions. The JOBS Act provides additional new
guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for
non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are
discussed below. Financial Disclosure. The financial
disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth
company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 will differ from
registration statements filed by other companies as
follows:

 

(i)
audited financial statements required for only two fiscal
years;

(ii)
selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that
were audited;

(iii)
executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited
format now required for smaller reporting companies. (A smaller
reporting company is one with a public float of less than $75
million as of the last day of its most recently completed second
fiscal quarter)

 

However,
the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation
S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already
provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting
companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company.

 

Currently
a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its
registration statement selected financial data and only needs
audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years
and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.

 

The JOBS
Act also exempts the Company’s independent registered public
accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) after the
date of the JOBS Act’s enactment, except as otherwise
required by SEC rule.

 

The JOBS
Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement
adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company’s
accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the
audit.

 

Internal
Control Attestation. The JOBS
Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the
Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to
file a report on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting, although management of the Company is still
required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting.

 

Section
102(a) of the JOBS Act goes on to exempt emerging growth companies
from the requirements in 1934 Act § 14A(e) for companies with
a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold
shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden
parachutes.

Other
Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS
Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate
with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or
institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a
contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing
the respective registration statement. The Act also permits
research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth
company regardless if such report provides sufficient information
for an investment decision. In addition the JOBS Act precludes the
SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or
regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors,
communications with management and distribution of a research
reports on the emerging growth company IPO.

 

Section
106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit
1933 Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided
that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly
filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show.
This is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore
the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is
seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its
registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a road
show.

 

Election
to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section
102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from
being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting
standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had
a 1933 Act registration statement declared effective or do not have
a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required
to comply with the new or revised financial accounting
standard.

 

The JOBS
Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended
transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to
non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out
is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the
transition period.

 

Legal
Proceedings

 

There are
no pending, threatened or actual legal proceedings in which the
Company is a party.

 

Agreement
with Tiber Creek Corporation

 

The
Company entered into an agreement with Tiber Creek Corporation
(“Tiber Creek”) whereby Tiber Creek would provide
assistance in effecting transactions for the Company to become a
public company, including the preparation and filing a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, advise and
assistance on listing its securities on a trading exchange,
assistance in establishing and maintaining relationships with
market makers and broker-dealers and assistance in other
transactions, marketing and corporate structure activities
available at that time.

A special fund that offers emergency financial relief for families in crisis;
A national hotline for veterans and their families that responds to hundreds of inquires each month from people across the country;
Business partnerships that make it possible to secure services and equipment at reduced rates or at no cost for families in need;
Assistance to veterans who are isolated from traditional social services support; and,
Support for families to stay together, to resolve their problems, and to determine their own course of action.

The NVSF mission is to educate and inform the public about the needs of veterans and their families; to assess the needs and provide limited assistance, relief, and referrals to appropriate agencies using programs that combine family guided case management (service coordination) and advocacy assistance while building social and community support.
 
National Veterans Services Fund is proud to work with IAA Donation Division, the largest vehicle donation processing company in North America, to handle the vehicle donation process on our behalf. The IAA Donation Division will take your car donation information, schedule your pick up appointment, handle all of the documents, sale at auction, and distribution of the proceeds to NVSF.
