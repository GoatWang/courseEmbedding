Welcome
Bailey Brothers, now Bailey Products, was formed in the 1970’s and in 2001 became a division of Cerro EMS, part of the Marmon Group who provide financial backing and global management expertise. Within this website you will find information regarding the range of Bailey drain and chimney cleaning rods and accessories, duct rods for cable laying produced to BT specifications and drain test plugs with associated testing equipment. 
				
 
 


Product Overview
The manufacturing quality of our products is of the highest standard and has been attained through years of experience and expert knowledge of the industry. Continuation of these traditional standards is essential and, in 1991, the company’s Quality Management System was assessed by BSI and registered to BS 5750 (now ISO 9001:2008), certifying our ability to supply quality products at a consistent level.
