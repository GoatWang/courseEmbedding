                              As the war on terrorism progresses, it appears stability operations may continue to be the logical follow-on phase after intervention
                                 into each failed state. There is a necessity for military forces in the post-conflict environment to keep the peace while
                                 the failed state rebuilds. The purpose of this monograph is to determine if end state is a relevant construct for the campaign
                                 planning of stability operations, specifically, peace operations. The monograph includes recommendations to improve both Army
                                 and joint doctrine in order to minimize confusion over the development of an end state. Recommendations are in the areas of
                                 strategy, doctrine, operational planning, civil-military relationship, and force planning and readiness

Michael W. Morrissey


President
Product and price are important considerations in the selection of an employee benefits program. Mike Morrissey, founding principal of Morrissey Insurance, brings more to his clients than hard numbers. His years of experience have helped establish his firm as a fully qualified insurance agency with an emphasis on employee benefits health programs.
“People come to us because we stay on top of the issues that affect them, whether these issues be legislative changes or subtle underwriting shifts. We act as advisors to companies buying health programs that want to deal with more than just insurance sales people. They want to work with an agency that has long-standing relationships with insurance providers, so they can tap into the right program for their employees.”
“We’ve built our reputation as a company that knows the insurance industry. I’m always gratified to hear, ‘Ask Morrissey Insurance,’ when a client has an employee benefit question.”
Mike is a graduate of the University of Nevada, Reno and has been a resident of Las Vegas for more than 60 years. He is licensed in property, casualty, life, and health.
His professional affiliations include:

National Association of Life Underwriters
Southern Nevada Association of Underwriters
Professional Insurance Association (past board member)

His community involvement includes:

Opportunity Village (past chairman)
R&R Foundation Board
Nevada Community Foundation
Bishop Gorman High School Advisory Board
Graduate of Leadership Las Vegas Program, Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce (vice chairman, chairman, past chairman)
Bank of Nevada, founding member and board of directors

Item Description: Createspace Independent Publishing Platform, United States, 2015. Paperback. Book Condition: New. Language: English . Brand New Book ***** Print on Demand *****. Did the CIA sabotage their own 1961 Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in the hope of trapping President Kennedy into a full-scale war? Was President Kennedy killed because he wanted to withdraw from Vietnam? What is one to make of Prof. Noam Chomsky s rejection of this thesis and his false debate with Prof. John Newman? The author analyzes his extensive correspondence with Chomsky on this issue. Was Nixon s Watergate downfall an inside job? Was the abortive coup against Gorbachev that led to the disintegration of the Soviet Union a KGB-CIA hoax? Was Alfred Herrhausen, chairman of the Deutsche Bank, murdered by his fellow bankers because of his progressive approach to Third-World debt? Is AIDS man-made - for the purpose of combating global overpopulation? This is the story of one American s attempt to grapple with the underbelly of recent history - a story which is very relevant to questions today such as the truth behind 9/11.
