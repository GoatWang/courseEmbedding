      the Echelon chip sets, the new Circon products enable EBAC customers to 
      take advantage of an FT transceiver combined with an IoT-enabled core 
      and multi-protocol functionality without needing to implement additional 
      gateways.
    


      With native and built-in support for touch screens, mobile access 
      devices, expansion I/O modules, sensors, utility gas/electric/water 
      meters and VFDs, IoT applications can be quickly and easily integrated 
      into the new SCC-420 and VAV-350 controllers. EBAC’s Windows-based 
      configuration and programming software is available in the SCC-420, and 
      is fully compatible with Echelon’s IzoT® Net Server platform.
    

      “With a vast installed base for our Circon products, we’re looking 
      forward to seeing the different ways in which our customers enhance 
      their building automation systems with the advanced functionality of our 
      new controllers,” said Surge Uppal, Principal of EBAC. “The 
      Internet-centric approach of the Echelon technology, and the freedom to 
      use the protocol of choice will offer huge amounts of flexibility when 
      customizing programs for specific situations.”
    

      For example, the software built into the new controllers will allow 
      schools to automatically adjust the lights and HVAC systems depending on 
      whether the students are in class, or whether the school is being 
      occupied after hours by office rentals. Not only can the controllers 
      bring reliability and robustness to building automations systems, but 
      the inherent flexibility enables customers to save valuable time and 
      cost.
    

      The new Circon SCC-420 is a fully-programmable multi-protocol BAS 
      controller based on an ARM9 host that provides simultaneous LON and 
      BACnet interfaces. It uses Echelon’s FT 5000 free topology transceiver 
      chip for the LON network interface. The VAV-350 is a controller based on 
      Echelon’s FT 6050 next-generation chip for smart networks, 
      simultaneously running LON FT, LonTalk/IP-FT, BACnet/IP-FT, and BACnet 
      MS-TP stacks to provide integrators with unparalleled flexibility for 
      installing the VAV-350.
    

      Both products will be on display at Booth C973 at AHR EXPO 2017 in Las 
      Vegas.
    

      Since its inception in 1992, the Circon product suite has focused on 
      developing open systems solutions for the rapidly expanding and dynamic 
      building automation market. Circon was the first North American product 
      that integrated multiple building control systems and continues to be a 
      leading-edge product in the open system marketplace.
