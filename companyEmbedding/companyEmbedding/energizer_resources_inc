                Battery Comparison Chart
            










With so many battery choices, you’ll need to find the right battery type and size for your particular device. Energizer provides a battery comparison chart to help you choose.     There are two basic battery types: Single-use batteries have a finite life and need to be replaced.  These include alkaline batteries like Energizer® MAX® and Energizer® EcoAdvanced®, and lithium batteries like our Energizer® Ultimate Lithium™ are good examples.  Other single-use batteries include silver oxide and miniature lithium specialty batteries and zinc air hearing aid batteries. Rechargeable batteries, of course, can be recharged again and again – some of them up to 1,000 times!  Check out the Energizer® Recharge® for more information.

                        Fasken Martineau represented GMP, in its capacity as agent and broker to Energizer Resources Inc. (Energizer Resources), in its connection with the placement of subscription receipts (“Subscription Receipts”) of the Company (the “Offering”) on the TSX. Each Subscription Receipt issued pursuant to the Offering was sold at a price of C$0.12 and was exercised, without additional consideration, on closing, for one common share (“Common Share”) and one half of one purchase warrant (each whole warrant, a “Warrant”). Each Warrant has an exercise price of C$0.18 and a term of 36 months following the date of issue, except for those Warrants issued to insiders which have a term of 18 months following the date of issue. The Offering raised gross proceeds of C$7,344,488 on the sale of 61,204,067 Subscription Receipts resulting in 61,204,067 Common Shares and 30,602,034 Warrants. Energizer Resources is a TSX listed mineral exploration and mine development company based in Toronto, Canada, which is focused on developing its 100%-owned flagship Molo flaked Graphite Project located near Fotadrevo, in Southern Madagascar, Africa. The net proceeds from the Offering will be used primarily to fund a feasibility study in respect of the Graphite Project. Funds will also be used for general working capital purposes, including generating additional quantities of graphite concentrate for product evaluation and marketing.

BACKGROUND - COMPANY OVERVIEW  We are incorporated in the State of Minnesota, USA and have a fiscal year end of June 30. Our principal business is the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral resources. We have not generated operating revenues or paid dividends since inception on March 1, 2004 to the period ended December 31, 2016 and we are unlikely to do so in the immediate future. Our business activities have been entirely financed from the proceeds of securities subscriptions.  During fiscal 2008, we incorporated Energizer Resources (Mauritius) Ltd. ("ERMAU"), a Mauritius subsidiary, and Energizer Resources Madagascar Sarl. ("ERMAD"), a Madagascar subsidiary of ERMAU. During fiscal 2009, the Company incorporated THB Ventures Ltd. ("THB"), a Mauritius subsidiary of ERMAU, and Energizer Resources Minerals Sarl. ("ERMIN"), a Madagascar subsidiary of THB, which holds the 100% ownership interest of the Green Giant Property in Madagascar (see note 7). During fiscal 2012, the Company incorporated Madagascar�ERG Joint Venture (Mauritius) Ltd. ("ERGJVM"), a Mauritius subsidiary of ERMAU, and ERG (Madagascar) Sarl. ("ERGMAD"), a Madagascar subsidiary of ERGJVM, which holds the Malagasy Joint Venture Ground. During fiscal 2014, the Company incorporated 2391938 Ontario Inc., an Ontario, Canada subsidiary.  Our authorized capital is six hundred fifty million (650,000,000) shares, with a par value of $0.001 per share, of which 640,000,000 are deemed common shares and the remaining 10,000,000 are deemed eligible to be divisible into classes, series and types with rights and preferences as designated by our Board of Directors.  We have not had any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding since incorporation. Except as described below, there have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or purchases or sales of any significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business since the date of incorporation.  Cautionary Note  Based on the nature of our business, we anticipate incurring operating losses for the foreseeable future. We base this expectation, in part, on the fact that very few mineral properties in the exploration stage are ultimately developed into producing and profitable mines. Our future financial results are uncertain due to a number of factors, some of which are outside the Company's control. These factors include, but are not limited to: (1) our ability to raise additional funding; (2) the market price for graphite, vanadium, gold and/or uranium; (3) the results of the exploration programs and metallurgical analysis of our mineral properties; (4) the political instability and/or environmental regulations that may adversely impact costs and ability to operate in Madagascar; and (5) our ability to find joint venture and/or off-take partners in order to advance the development of our mineral properties.  Any future equity financing will cause existing shareholders to experience dilution of their ownership interest in the Company. In the event the Company is not successful in raising additional financing, we anticipate the Company will not be able to proceed with its business plan. In such a case, the Company may decide to discontinue or modify its current business plan and seek other business opportunities in the resource sector.  During this period, the Company will need to maintain periodic filings with the appropriate regulatory authorities and will incur legal, accounting, administrative and listing costs. In the event no other such opportunities are available and the Company cannot raise additional capital to sustain operations, the Company may be forced to discontinue the business. The Company does not have any specific alternative business opportunities under consideration and have not planned for any such contingency.  Due to the lack of operating history and present inability to generate revenues, the Company auditors have stated their opinion in the notes to our audited financial statements in the annual report on Form 10-K and the Company has included in Note 1 of this quarterly report that there currently exists doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.  Summary of Our Business  We are an exploration stage company primarily engaged in the advancement of the Molo Graphite Project, consisting of a commercially minable graphite deposit situated in the African country of Madagascar. We have additional exploration stage properties situated in Madagascar and in the Province of Quebec, Canada.  Our executive offices are situated at 520-141 Adelaide Street West, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5H 3L5 and the primary telephone number is (416) 364-4986. Our website is www.energizerresources.com (which website is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing).  Further details regarding each of our Madagascar properties, although not incorporated by reference, including the comprehensive geological report prepared in accordance Canada's National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Properties ("NI 43-101") for the Molo Graphite Property and separately the technical report on the Green Giant Property in Madagascar can be found on the Company's website at www.energizerresources.com (which website is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing) or in the Company's Canadian regulatory filings at www.sedar.com (which website and content is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing). We report mineral reserve estimates in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Industry Guide 7 ("Guide 7") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "U.S. Securities Act"). As a reporting issuer in Canada with our primary trading market in Canada, we are also required to prepare reports on our mineral properties in accordance with NI 43-101. The technical reports referenced in this document uses the terms "mineral resource," "measured mineral resource," "indicated mineral resource" and "inferred mineral resource". These terms are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, information in respect of our resources determined in accordance with NI 43-101 are not contained in this document.  Summary of Milestones and Future Plans  We are pursuing negotiations in respect of potential off-take agreements with graphite end-users and intermediaries with the intention of securing project financing alternatives, which may include debt, equity and derivative instruments. Discussions in respect of these matters have been ongoing for the past 24 months and are expected to continue during the coming months with no assurances as to the conclusion or results of these discussions.  In July 2016, we appointed UK-based HCF International Advisers Limited ("HCF") as advisor in negotiating and structuring strategic partnerships, off take agreements and debt financing for its Molo Graphite project.  In August 2016, we initiated a Front End Engineering Design Study (the "FEED Study") and value engineering for our Molo graphite project in Madagascar. The FEED Study was undertaken in order to optimize the mine plan as envisioned in the Molo Feasibility Study and determine the optimal development path based on discussions with prospective strategic partners. All costing aspects were examined with the goal of providing a method to produce meaningful, multi-tonne test samples of Molo graphite concentrate to potential off-takers while reducing the CAPEX and time required to the commencement of commercial production.  On November 7, 2016, we outlined a multi-phase development plan for the Molo Graphite project based on the FEED Study and value engineering. The results support the construction of a cost-effective demonstration plant to test and verify the flow sheet design from the Molo Graphite Project Feasibility Study. Under an exploration permit, the Company will initially be limited to an ore input of 20,000 cubic meters (or approximately 50,000 tonnes) of front-end feed into the demonstration plant. The Company has already initiated the application process for a mining permit, which upon approval would remove the 20,000 cubic meter test limit. At full capacity, the demonstration plant would be capable of processing up to 240,000 tonnes of feed per annum, which equates to 30 tonnes per hour of ore feed and roughly 1 to 3 tonnes of flake graphite concentrate production per hour.  Phase 1  Energizer has advance discussions with several potential off-takers to the stage where they have requested multi-tonne samples of Molo concentrate for full-scale end-product production runs prior to entering into any definitive off-take contracts.  Phase 1 will consist of the construction of a demonstration processing plant capable of producing flake graphite concentrate on a test basis. The demonstration plant is designed to be a "proof of concept" operation with the goal of optimizing the process circuit while allowing the Company to supply a true "run-of-mine" flake concentrate to potential off-takers and customers for final product validation.  Base, essential-only, infrastructure will be constructed during this phase. The plant will utilize dry-stack tailings in order to eliminate the up-front capital costs associated with a tailings dam. Energizer's existing camp adjacent to the nearby town of Fotadrevo will be used to accommodate employees and offices, with additional housing available within the town for additional employees.  It is estimated that once financed, the Phase I processing plant will require a total of 9 months to complete. This build-out will include detailed engineering, equipment procurement, off-site fabrication and assembly of plant modules, factory assurance testing (FAT), module disassembly and shipping, plant infrastructure construction and onsite module assembly. Total costs are estimated at approximately US$8,500,000 ($7,000,000 for the processing plant and $1,500,000 for related infrastructure).  Phase 2  Once the process circuit has been proven and optimized in Phase 1, Phase 2 will be initiated, which includes the development of sustaining infrastructure required for long-term processing and the ramp up of the demonstration plant production to its full capacity of 240,000 tonnes per annum (or 30 tonnes per hour) of ore.  This phase will likely include the construction of additional on-site accommodation and offices, upgrading of road infrastructure to access the mine-site and equipment purchases to provide redundancy within the processing circuit. The costs for these expenditures are unknown at this time, but will be assessed in parallel with the development of Phase 1.  Energizer will also assess the addition of back-end value-added processing for lithium-ion battery and graphite foil applications in the classification portion of the demonstration plant. The costs for these expenditures are unknown at this time, but will be assessed in parallel with the development of Phase 1.  Assuming the demonstration plant operates at full capacity, it is estimated it could produce up to 14,750 tonnes of graphite at the estimated operating costs outlined in the table below.   FEED Study Operating Cost Summary Ore US$/T Concentrate US$/T Mining $ 5.29 $ 86.07 Processing $ 18.47 $ 300.46 General & Administrative $ 4.17 $ 67.85 Trucking to Port $ 68.60 Shipping (CIF Rotterdam) $ 140.53 Total Costs $ 663.51  Phase 3  Upon the successful completion of Phases 1 and 2, we anticipate the initiation of Phase 3 of the development of the Molo Project. This will involve additional construction of mine infrastructure and plant construction into a fully operational large-scale mine as envisioned in the Molo Feasibility Study. This would include construction of a tailings dam facility and upgrading of the regional road system used to transport graphite concentrate to the port.  The results of the FEED Study is part of management's ongoing assessment of project optimization strategies with the intention of reducing the capital and operating costs relating to the Molo Graphite Project, with no assurances as to the conclusion and results of these assessments and efforts. During Phase 1, this will include the assessment of the possibility of utilizing a modular build methodology for the full-scale Molo mine. We anticipate that any modules used in Phase 1 and 2 will be integrated, where possible, into the Phase 3 plant build-out. If these efforts are successful, we expect it will be possible to achieve CAPEX and OPEX cost savings for full-scale production, relative to those envisioned in the Molo Feasibility Study.  From the date of this report, and subject to availability of capital, our plan during the next 12 months is to incur between $750,000 and $10,000,000 on further engineering, exploration, testing, Phase 1 construction and permitting to advance the Molo Graphite project, subject to the availability of capital and any other unforeseen delays, by December 31, 2017. No assurances can be provided that we will achieve our objectives by that date.  The following is a summary of the amounts budgeted to be incurred (presuming all $10,000,000 is required):   FEED Study and Value Engineering $ 250,000 Metallurgy $ 500,000 Phase 1 processing plant $ 7,000,000 Phase 1 related infrastructure $ 1,500,000 Permitting fees $ 750,000 Total $ 10,000,000  The above amounts may be updated based on actual costs and the timing may be delayed based on several factors, including the availability of capital to fund the budget. We anticipate that the source of funds required to complete the budgeted items disclosed above will come from private placements in the capital markets, but there can be no assurance that financing will be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following are explanations of the material changes for the six and three month periods ended December 31, 2016 compared to the six and three month periods ended December 31, 2015: Six months ended Three months ended December 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, 2016 2015 2016 2015 Revenues $ - $ - Expenses Mineral exploration expense 835,402 360,656 522,295 183,697 Professional and consulting fees 279,031 395,680 135,314 206,963 Stock based compensation - 331,491 - 331,491 General and administrative 220,565 219,892 158,381 129,034 Depreciation 21,911 34,600 10,910 11,001 Part XII.6 Taxes 129,478 - 95,848 - Foreign currency translation loss 100,612 93,180 47,376 (10,138 ) Total Expenses 1,586,999 1,435,499 970,124 852,048 Net Loss From Operations (1,586,999 ) (1,435,499 ) (970,124 ) (852,048 ) Other Income (Expenses) Investment income - 561 - 280 Change in value of warrant liability 111,049 513,110 53,883 (120,396 ) Net Income (Loss) $ (1,475,950 ) $ (921,828 ) $ (916,241 ) $ (972,164 ) Unrealized loss from marketable securities - (3,049 ) (4,225 ) Comprehensive Income (Loss) $ (1,475,950 ) $ (924,877 ) $ (916,241 ) $ (976,389 ) Income (loss) per share - basic and diluted $ (0.00 ) $ (0.00 ) $ (0.00 ) $ (0.00 ) Weighted average shares outstanding 400,421,842 333,137,168 460,995,711 343,189,001  ? Mineral exploration costs increased as the company increased metallurgical analysis activities related to the Feed Study and for general Molo graphite project expenditures as compared to the previous period.  ? Professional fees and general and administrative (G&A) costs decreased as a result of a reduction in employees and consultants but increased overall due to an increase in travel costs as compared to the previous period.  ? Part XII.6 taxes were incurred to settle taxes payable to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) related to the issuance of flow-through shares during fiscal 2014.  ? Warrants expiring in January 2017 were issued in a currency other than our functional currency. In accordance with ASC 815 Derivatives and Hedging, the fair value of the warrants was estimated using a binomial model and was recorded as a derivative liability. The liability must be subsequently remeasured at the end of each financial reporting period until expiration or exercise of the underlying warrants.  Liquidity, Capital Resources and Foreign Currencies The following are explanations of the material changes to the working capital position as of December 31, 2016 when compared to June 30, 2016: December 31, 2016 June 30, 2016 (Unaudited) Current Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 3,607,641 $ 544,813 Amounts receivable 83,268 13,955 Prepaid expenses 26,126 11,545 Total current assets 3,717,035 570,313 Current Liabilities: Accounts payable $ 155,956 $ 215,391 Accrued liabilities 16,658 24,743 Contingency provision 176,606 182,742 Warrant liability - 111,049 Total current liabilities 349,220 533,925 Net Working Capital Position $ 3,367,815 $ 36,388  In managing liquidity, management's primary objective is to ensure the entity can continue as a going concern while raising additional funding to meet our obligations as they come due. Our operations to date have been funded by issuing equity. Our company expects to raise additional working capital to fund planned project expenditures by securing additional financing. The existing working capital position is expected to be sufficient to fund non-project expenditures for the next 12 months.  We hold a significant portion of our cash reserves in Canadian dollars to satisfy non-exploration expenditures such as professional and consulting fees and general and administrative costs, which are mainly incurred in Canadian dollars. Due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations, the remeasurement of the value of Canadian dollar reserves into US dollars results in foreign currency translation gains or losses. If there was to be a significant decline in the Canadian dollar against the US dollar, the value of that Canadian dollar cash reserves, as presented on the balance sheet, could significantly decline causing significant foreign currency translation losses. In addition, certain of our ongoing expenditures are in South African Rand, Madagascar Ariary and Euros requiring us to occasionally hold reserves of these foreign currencies with a similar risk of foreign exchange currency translation losses.  Capital Financings  We have funded our business to date from sales of our securities. We will require additional funding throughout fiscal 2017 to advance our projects, which will likely be in the form of equity financing from the issuance of additional common shares. However, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common shares.  Net proceeds during the past two years:  � For the year ended June 30, 2015, we raised net proceeds of $6,663,148 through the issuance of 40,757,067 common shares and 22,626,569 common share purchase warrants.  � On October 7, 2015, we closed a non-brokered private placement offering of 14,200,000 units (the "Units") at a price of $0.04 (CAD$0.05) per Unit, representing gross proceeds of $530,673 (CAD$710,000). Insiders subscribed for a total of $50,000CAD as part of this Offering. Each Unit is comprised of one  � On February 4, 2016, we closed a private placement offering of 6,437,900 units (the "Units") at a price of $0.05 (CAD$0.07) per unit, representing aggregate gross proceeds of $328,977 (CAD$450,653). Each Unit consisted of one common share and one common share purchase warrant (a "Warrant"). Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share at a price of $0.11 per common share until February 4, 2018.  � On April 11, 2016, we closed a private placement offering of 3,207,857 units (the "Units") at a price of $0.05 (CAD$0.07) per unit, representing aggregate gross proceeds of $172,638 (CAD$224,550). Each Unit consisted of one common share and one common share purchase warrant (a "Warrant"). Each Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one common share at a price of $0.11 per common share until April 11, 2018.  � On May 17, 2016, we closed a private placement offering of 11,150,000 common shares at a price of $0.07 (CAD$0.09) per unit, representing aggregate gross proceeds of $772,500 (CAD$1,003,500).  � On August 18, 2016, we closed a private placement offering of 96,064,286 common shares at a price of $0.05 (CAD$0.07) per unit, representing aggregate gross proceeds of $5,177,865 (CAD$6,724,500).  Net proceeds subsequent to the end of the reporting period:  Each of the issuances above were effected in reliance upon the exemption provided by Regulation S under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for a transaction not involving a public offering. We completed the offering of the shares pursuant to Rule 903 of Regulation S of the Securities Act on the basis that the sale of the securities was completed in an "offshore transaction", as defined in Rule 902(h) of Regulation S. Each investor represented to us that the investor was not a U.S. person, as defined in Regulation S, and was not acquiring the shares for the account or benefit of a U.S. person. The securities contain a legend restricting the sale of such securities in accordance with the Securities Act.  Off-balance sheet arrangements  The Company does not have off-balance sheet arrangements including any arrangements that would affect the liquidity, capital resources, market risk support and credit risk support or other benefits.

                Battery Comparison Chart
            










With so many battery choices, you’ll need to find the right battery type and size for your particular device. Energizer provides a battery comparison chart to help you choose.     There are two basic battery types: Single-use batteries have a finite life and need to be replaced.  These include alkaline batteries like Energizer® MAX® and Energizer® EcoAdvanced®, and lithium batteries like our Energizer® Ultimate Lithium™ are good examples.  Other single-use batteries include silver oxide and miniature lithium specialty batteries and zinc air hearing aid batteries. Rechargeable batteries, of course, can be recharged again and again – some of them up to 1,000 times!  Check out the Energizer® Recharge® for more information.
