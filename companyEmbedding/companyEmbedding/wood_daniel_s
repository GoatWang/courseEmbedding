I cannot thank you enough for the incredible structure that rules over our yard now. Any child, and most adults for that matter, are just shocked when they round our corner and see the tree house (Will asked me to get a lock for it to keep other kids out- haha). I mean literally stop-in-your-tracks-and-hang-your-mouth-open shocked. It is truly, truly cool.

RON DANIELS
Ron grew up with John and their older brother on a ranch. They were a real life Tom Sawyer-like bunch of country boys. After the chores were done they were always up to something creative, and ohhh the forts they built! Ron headed off to college in the early 1990’s and finished his Master’s degree in Mathematics in 1999. From there he went full time into the tree house business with John. Wanting to broaden the business, Ron combined his electronics passion with John’s creativity and developed the shooting gallery division of the company. Today he’s the President of DWL and coordinates the general business matters while still focusing on having fun with shooting galleries.
 



JOHN DANIELS
You can trace the beginning of DWL all the way back to when John was in grade school, drawing pictures instead of listening to his teacher. During high school John started carving small faces and made a little money selling them. A short time later he tried carving with a chainsaw and realized he was a natural right from the beginning. And he’s been carving ever since. In 1997, John decided to build a clubhouse set atop a real hollowed log, took it to a home & garden show, and sold dozens of them. The rest is history!
 


















Grilling Product Review: Jack Daniel’s Whiskey Grilling Pellets | GrillJunkie - Addiction to Grilling

























































Grilling Product Review: Jack Daniel’s Whiskey Grilling Pellets




Jack Daniel’s Grilling Pellets: Sinatra Worthy or Dud?
On a consistent basis the team here at GrillJunkie™ sets time aside to communicate our formal opinion on either a Grilling, BBQ or Burger related product or event such as a BBQ Pitmaster contest, a chili cook-off or a tailgating event. As you certainly can imagine, and most likely have experienced yourself, these products and events run the gamut from Gotta Have It!, Cool, Useful, Utilitarian, Ridiculous and the, well, Just Plain Asinine!
Today’s candidate is:

Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey Grilling Pellets

The GrillJunkie™ Grilling Product Review (GPR) Scale
In addition to a formal written review, we also assign a visual indication of our opinion to every product, as depicted through our Grilling Product Review (GPR) scale:

First Up: A Bit of Grilling Pellet History
What exactly are grilling pellets? What’s the big deal? Even if you just casually know enough about grilling and BBQ to be moderately dangerous, chances are you’ve heard of the growing popularity of using pellets for grilling, BBQ and smoking.
The Trager Lil Texas Elite Wood Pellet Grill
Here’s a brief bit of history and background: Back in 1985 Joe Traeger, fortunately, was less focused on cheezy metal bands, jean jackets and big hair and focused his attention on starting up Traeger Grills. From his blood, sweat and tears came the introduction of the first pellet grill to the world. Since then the Traeger family has continued to make pellet grills and smokers and have attracted what would certainly be categorized as a “cult following.”
This success and insatiable demand lead to a wide range of pellet grills and smokers on the market. The unique flavor that is created by the use of a pellet grill combined with their versatility have made pellet grills a favorite among backyard cooking zealots. The main appeal of pellet grills is their versatility of being fully capable of grilling, roasting, barbecuing and smoking.
The Star Fuel of the Show: Wood Grilling Pellets
Okay, so we’ve learned about the wood pellet grills, what about their fuel source? A wood pellet in essence, is a small, 1/4″ diameter piece of natural hardwood that looks like a long pill, sometimes like a small piece of black licorice. When pellets are made, all of the air within the cellular structure of the wood is evacuated, thus concentrating the wood into a very dense form, much denser than the natural tree.
As compared to other wood flavor enhancers, pellets will yield a more intense smoke more quickly which seals the food, locking in natural moisture and adding smoke flavor exactly when it’s needed. Due to their small size, wood pellets burn cleanly and quickly to a fine ash. Wood pellets burn at about 8,500 BTUs per pound and are marketed in a wide variety of “flavors” ranging from traditional BBQ and smoking woods such as hickory and oak to cherry, apple or mesquite.
The pellets in a normal pellet grill are fed from a storage hopper to a burning box at a controlled rate. This rate is adjustable based on whether a high temperature for grilling or a low temperature for smoking is desired. Because of the automated feed of the wood pellets, you can basically turn the grill on, give it 10 to 15 minutes to heat up, and be ready to grill in almost no time. This makes it as convenient as a gas grill but with the added flavor of hardwood cooking.
The Sinatra Test: Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey Grilling Pellets
Before we proceed to the formal review, it is important to note that our reviews follow an organized and comprehensive structure which includes: the Problem that needs to be solved or addressed, the product’s Solution to that problem, followed by the Good, the Bad and the infrequent Ugly elements of the product or service. Finally we provide a Verdict along with an official GrillJunkie™ GPR (Grilling Product Rating).
So let’s dig in to the Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey Grilling Pellets review.
Official Product Review and GPR

 Problem – The way we view it, the wood grilling pellet market has quickly become infiltrated with poorly made, mass produced wood pellets with no competitive differentiation, predictable flavor categories and utilitarian packaging. The demand for an expanded flavor spectrum packaged in an attention grabbing and informative package is high and the opportunity is ripe for the taking.


Product’s Solution Pitch – The product addresses the problem by developing, marketing and distributing a lineup of grilling accessories and fuel sources among which is specifically targeted towards the wood grilling pellet consumer. Specifically, the product pitch ad copy reads:

 “Jack Daniel’s smoking pellets are made from the actual mellowing charcoal from the distillery, pulverized and mixed with sawdust then pelletized. The pellets give a STRONG, sweet smoke flavor and an aromatic tang to a variety of grilled meats including beef, pork, poultry and game.”


The Good – The product has 2 positive attributes. First, the product directly addresses the issue of flavor choice limitations. By infusing the distinctive flavor and aroma of Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey, the product provides the consumer with an expanded choice beyond the traditional hardwood and fruitwood offerings. The GrillJunkie™ team used the grilling pellets on a quickly seared steak and slowly BBQ’d and smoked brisket, ribs and venison and found that the product is easy to use and produces a great amount of smoke that permeates the meat, detectable in both aroma and taste. Jack Daniel’s Smoking Pellets are made from the used mellowing charcoal from the Jack Daniel’s Distillery in Lynchburg, Tennessee. This charcoal is soaked in whiskey for weeks before exchanging for a fresh batch of charcoal. The charcoal is mixed with oak and processed into wood pellets for BBQ smoking.
Secondly, the product is attractively packaged with the eye-grabbing brand attention of a well known American whiskey brand. 
Here are a few statistics that our Product Review Team recorded:


Contents- Mellowed charcoal and natural oak hardwood saturated with Jack Daniel’s Whiskey
Burn Rate – 1/2 pound per hour @175 degrees F & 2.3 pounds per hour @ 450 degrees F
Ash Residual – 1/2 cup of ash per 10 pound bag
Optimal Applications – Best on beef, pork, poultry and game





The Bad – There are 2 important negative attributes to this product. The first is easily forgiven, the second not so easily ignored. First, you will have to overcome the urge to draw out your shot or drinking glass as the distinctive Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey aroma may temporarily seduce you into overlooking its unfamiliar form and tape a sip.

Secondly, this product will give the wood pellet “purist” a bit of outdoor grilling agita due to the fact that they are not made purely from hardwood sawdust. They are in fact made from, if you didn’t already catch this from their product pitch, the actual mellowing charcoal from the distillery, pulverized and mixed with hardwood oak sawdust then pelletized.

The Ugly – We did not believe that this variable applied to this product. This variable is usually mentioned for the strange, extremely unique or outright asinine product. An example of strange would be our Product Review of McPhee’s Bacon Body Wash wherein, besides the obvious we took a shot at their package design. Enough said, let’s move on.
Verdict – We give the Jack Daniel’s Tennessee Whiskey Grilling Pellets 4 out of 5 GrillJunkie™ GPR Firepots, which equates to a Hot! product but not quite Searing!! This product addresses and solves the problem for which it was designed. The product at its basic level (grilling pellets) is not necessarily unique as the grilling pellet market is maturing, however because of the strength of the Jack Daniel’s brand awareness, the product immediately draws attention and delivers, albeit with a non-purist manufacturing twist. We found that this product infused a strong but not overwhelming aromatic tang and smokiness to a variety of grilled meats including beef, pork, poultry and game while maintaining slightly better than average burn rate and low ash residual.


Sinatra Worthy? At the end of the day, we believe that the folks at Jack Daniels should be proud of this product. By bridge-branding over into the grilling and BBQ realm, they prove that they still understand the demographics of their fan base. The true test, however would be what the great Frank Sinatra would think if he owned a pellet grill and was aware of Jack Daniel’s continuing contribution:
“Basically, I’m for anything that gets you through the night – be it prayer, tranquilizers or a bottle of Jack Daniel’s.”
Frank Sinatra

Comments ( 4 )ReplyBexee November 28, 2013 Sounds like a great product!
Replybubalouie June 29, 2014 First, what is the sawdust that is added? I'd it a less flavorful, softer wood, it would be good to know. 

Second, you spent more time talking about branding and your opinion of it, than you did telling us about what is important. Can you elaborate on the taste characteristics, burn efficiency, completeness of burn, and overall impression of value compared to other products?
ReplyGrill Junkie boy June 29, 2014 Thanks for the detailed question Bubalouie. We added more detail to the review thanks to your question. Here is what we added in a nutshell. The sawdust is actually hardwood oak.

•The Good - The product has 2 positive attributes. First, the product directly addresses the issue of flavor choice limitations. By infusing the distinctive flavor and aroma of Jack Daniel's Tennessee Whiskey, the product provides the consumer with an expanded choice beyond the traditional hardwood and fruitwood offerings. The GrillJunkie™ team used the grilling pellets on a quickly seared steak and slowly BBQ'd and smoked brisket, ribs and venison and found that the product is easy to use and produces a great amount of smoke that permeates the meat, detectable in both aroma and taste.

ReplyLiam June 11, 2017 I'll keep it simple. I try the JD pellets in my Traeger on St first, thought they turned out awesome.
Next I use it to smoke venison ham ( cured 5 days pink salt) and that turned out even better. I've been quite pleased. Try it!
