CRESCENT BUYS 382-ROOM RESORT HOTEL ON ST. PETE BEACH
02/02/2017

FORT WORTH, TEXAS (February 2, 2017) – Crescent Real Estate LLC (Crescent) announced it used the GP Invitation Fund I (GPIF) to purchase the Sirata Beach Resort and Conference Center, a 382-room resort property on St. Pete Beach, Florida. The resort sits on 15.4 acres and features 725 feet of beach front along the Gulf of Mexico west coast in the St. Petersburg/Clearwater/Tampa, Florida market. The hotel and conference center has 30,000 square feet of meeting space, including a 5,100-square-foot ballroom, three restaurants and three swimming pools.


 
Crescent indicated that they plan to make significant capital investments to enhance guest experiences including updated guest rooms, and improvements and additions to indoor and outdoor resort amenities. 


 
Crescent is partnering on the investment with Atlanta-based Five Star Realty Partners, LLC (Five Star), a North America real estate investment and advisory firm, and is engaging the hotel management firm, HEI Hotels, to operate the resort property. Crescent and Five Star used their relationship with the Sirata Beach Resort owner, the Nicklaus family, to secure the deal in an off-market transaction. Crescent and Five Star are working together on other investment and development deals. 


 
“This was a unique opportunity to secure an excellent resort property ideally positioned to grow,” said Jason Anderson, Crescent’s Co-CEO. “Located on one of the best beaches in the country, the Sirata Beach Resort attracts guests from across the US with its easy ‘drive-to’ access and proximity to the St. Petersburg and Tampa airports. 


 
“Our relationships and our knowledge of the property allowed us to quickly secure a fair off-market deal,” added Anderson. Crescent has been an active investor in the Tampa area since 2011 and currently owns 2,200 multifamily units in the region.



 
“The Nicklaus family has been great to work with on this transaction. There was a clear pride of ownership and community involvement that we plan to continue in our ownership,” said Justin Wilson of Five Star. “We are excited for what the renovation will bring to the resort and how the changes will impact the guest experience,” said Wilson. 


 
HEI Hotels is a leading independent hotel manager. In 2016, Crescent engaged HEI to operate the Hotel Crescent Court, a 220-room luxury hotel in Uptown Dallas. Hotel Crescent Court was one of the early acquisitions by the Crescent-managed GP Invitation Fund I. GPIF is an investment fund established by John Goff, chairman of Crescent, in 2016. Crescent manages the fund for Goff and the fund’s investment partners.

Fund Information




Investment Officers: Steven Romick, CFA Mark Landecker, CFA Brian Selmo, CFA  Founded: 1993; under FPA management since March 1996 


Fund Data as of 7/27/2017Net Asset Value: $34.35Ticker: FPACXCUSIP: 30254T759




 FPA Crescent Fund Investment Objective and Strategy: The Fund seeks to generate equity-like returns over the long-term, take less risk than the market and avoid permanent impairment of capital.    Philosophy: Absolute value investors. We seek genuine bargains rather than relatively attractive securities. Alignment of interests. We invest our money alongside yours, and we act as stewards of our shared capital.  Broad mandate. We invest across the capital structure, asset classes, market caps, industries, and  geographies.  We are willing to hold cash. Long-term focus. We believe the best way to accomplish our goals is to accept short-term             underperformance in exchange for long-term success. Macroeconomic view. We incorporate an understanding (sometimes limited) of the economic       environment. Volatility.  If we have performed our research correctly, volatility creates opportunity, not risk. Downside protection / Risk minimization. We aim to protect capital first and create long-term   equity-like returns second.  We cannot eliminate risk, but we conduct ourselves by hoping for the best, while preparing for the worst.  Value investing does not protect against loss of principal and there is no assurance that the Fund will meet its objective.

Crescent Fund Buys Six Multifamily Projects

FORT WORTH — Crescent Real Estate LLC, a Fort Worth-based firm led by John Goff, used its recently established investment fund to acquire six multifamily properties, including the RiverBend Apartments in the Houston area.
The 192-unit RiverBend Apartments are located on Wesley Drive in League City, southeast of Houston near Interstate 45.
Acquired by Crescent through “off-market” deals, the multifamily properties are geographically diverse in five separate submarkets. This is Crescent’s most recent use of the GP Invitation Fund I established earlier in the year to acquire, develop and operate properties in all real estate asset classes alongside institutional investors and high net worth clients.
The portfolio is located in four states totaling 1,664 units. All six of the multifamily properties are located in large metropolitan areas. Three properties are located in Texas with two locations in San Antonio and the one in League City. One property is in Chicago suburb Evanston, Illinois, another is in Washington, D.C. suburb Reston, Virginia, and the final of the six properties is located in Tampa, Florida.
Crescent secured five of the six properties totaling 1,324 units in an “off-market” deal from a joint venture of Crossbeam Concierge and a large institutional partner. Crescent has engaged Crossbeam Concierge to continue managing the Texas, Illinois and Virginia properties.
“We feel we have taken advantage of a great opportunity and are excited to secure a quality portfolio of this size in strong submarkets,” said Conrad Suszynski, Co-CEO of Crescent. “Because of our relationships with and our knowledge of the companies and the markets, we were able to purchase the properties before they went on the market and substantially below replacement costs.”

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Florida:













Does Crescent Multifamily Construction Llc carry a valid contracting license?



If you pay someone to construct a building or a structure, make structural alterations to load bearing walls, or perform services such as plumbing or air conditioning work, that person must have a state contractor's license.
Crescent Multifamily Construction Llc currently holds license 0061144, 0003637, CGC059001 (Construction Business Information, Construction Financial Officer, Certified General Contractor), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Florida?



The Florida Construction Industry License Board maintains high standards for contractor licensing. Prior to receiving their license, Florida contractors are required to prove four years of relevant work experience or education; pass a board examination and prove financial solvency.











Your liability risk when hiring Crescent Multifamily Construction Llc



In Florida, licensed contractors with employees are required to carry workers' compensation insurance and attest they have obtained public liability and property damage insurance in the amounts determined by the Board.











Financial recourse when hiring Crescent Multifamily Construction Llc



Florida maintains a recovery fund, called the Florida Homeowners' Construction Recovery Fund, which is available to a natural person who has suffered monetary damages by the financial mismanagement or misconduct of a contractor, and who has exhausted all other sources of payment. The Board makes the determination of eligibility for an award. Florida contractors are not required to carry an active bond.











What else should I know before hiring Crescent Multifamily Construction Llc



As of 2007, the Florida DBPR began requiring license applicants to submit their fingerprints, which are used to run a criminal background check with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. In addition, they are required to provide a credit report during the license application process to demonstrate financial stability. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Florida Construction Industry License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

for any job, commercial or residential.
