During the weekend of August 22/23, our third-party Administrator (The Bank of New York Mellon – BNYM) experienced a technical malfunction resulting in it being unable to calculate timely NAVs for its mutual funds and ETF clients, including the PowerShares ETFs. As we disclosed to you last week, we experienced a delay in the dissemination of the NAV. PowerShares worked aggressively with BNYM to resolve the issue. We are pleased to report that the malfunction has been corrected by the Administrator and that the system is back to normal. The NAV that is being disseminated today is the most recent NAV for the Funds (as of Thursday, September 3).
For primary market participants, please note that, in accordance with the Prospectus and the SAI for each PowerShares ETF, orders received before the cut-off time on any given day were processed at the NAV that was calculated by the Administrator for that day. Given the delay in the calculation and dissemination of the NAV by the Administrator, we expect that most of the orders that the Administrator received last week will settle in the normal settlement cycle. Certain orders may experience (or have experienced) a  delay in settlement. Secondary market transactions were not affected by the delay and  are anticipated to settle in ordinary course.
See detailed list of last week's NAVs  
For additional information please contact PowerShares at 1-800-983-0903.

Morningstar details

Source: Morningstar Inc. Ratings are based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. Open-end mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are considered a single population for comparison purposes. Ratings are calculated for funds with at least a three year history. The overall rating is derived from a weighted average of three-, five- and 10-year rating metrics, as applicable, excluding sales charges and including fees and expenses. ©2017 Morningstar Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers. It may not be copied or distributed and is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The top 10% of funds in a category receive five stars, the next 22.5% four stars, the next 35% three stars, the next 22.5% two stars and the bottom 10% one star. Ratings are subject to change monthly. Had fees not been waived and/or expenses reimbursed currently or in the past, the Morningstar rating would have been lower. Ratings for other share classes may differ due to different performance characteristics.

				NASDAQ Composite Index returns shown are price return.

Market returns are based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and do not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times. Performance data quoted represents past performance, which is not a guarantee of future results. Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be higher or lower than performance data quoted. After-tax returns reflect the highest federal income tax rate but exclude state and local taxes. Fund performance reflects applicable fee waivers, absent which, performance data quoted would have been lower. After Tax Held and After Tax Sold are based on NAV. Returns less than one year are cumulative.

Growth of $10,000



				Data beginning 10 years prior to the ending date of 06/30/2017.  Fund performance shown at NAV.
An investor cannot invest directly in an index. The results assume that no cash was added to or assets withdrawn from the Index. Index returns do not represent Fund returns. The Index does not charge management fees or brokerage expenses, nor does the Index lend securities, and no revenues from securities lending were added to the performance shown.

Distribution Information



Fund Distributions

Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid either quarterly or monthly, depending on the Fund. For Funds on a quarterly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the third Friday of each March, June, September and December, payable the last business day of the month. For Funds on a monthly dividend payment cycle, the dividend ex-date is generally the 15th of each month, payable the last business day of the month. 
The fund distributes its net realized capital gains, if any, to shareholders annually. Prior to paying a distribution of net investment income, the fund has the ability to invest cash generated from investment income into additional securities or money market instruments.
Distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares of the fund only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available. Shareholders of the fund may contact their broker to determine the availability and costs of the service and the details of participation. Brokers may require shareholders to adhere to specific procedures and timetables. If this service is available and used, dividend distributions of both income and realized gains will be automatically reinvested in additional whole shares of the fund purchased in the secondary market. 
Taxes on Distributions
In general, your distributions are subject to federal income tax when they are paid, whether you take them in cash or reinvest them in the Fund. Dividends paid out of the Fund’s income and net short-term gains, if any, are taxable as ordinary income. Distributions of net long-term capital gains, if any, in excess of net short-term capital losses are taxable as long-term capital gains, regardless of how long you have held the Shares. Dividends from net investment income, if any, are declared and paid quarterly. The Fund may also pay a special distribution at the end of the calendar year to comply with federal tax requirements. 
Under the provisions of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 (the “2003 Tax Act”), long-term capital gains tax rates have generally been reduced for individuals to a maximum of 15% for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2009. In addition, some ordinary dividends declared and paid by the Fund to individual shareholders may qualify for taxation at the lower reduced tax rates applicable to long-term capital gains, provided that holding period and other requirements are met by the Fund and the shareholder. 
Distributions in excess of the Fund’s current and accumulated earnings and profits are treated as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of your basis in the Shares, and as capital gain thereafter. A distribution will reduce the Fund’s net asset value per Share and may be taxable to you as ordinary income or capital gain even though, from an investment standpoint, the distribution may constitute a return of capital. 
By law, the Fund must withhold a percentage of your distributions and proceeds if you have not provided a taxpayer identification number or social security number. The backup withholding rate is currently 28%.

PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1 (ETF)(NASDAQ:QQQ): Big Inflows Seen | ETF Daily News

































 




























































Dip-Buyers Pour Billions Into The Powershares QQQ


 July 12, 2017 12:02pm  NASDAQ:QQQ  



 




Analyst/ETF Trader Paul Weisbruch of Street One Financial brings us his daily fund flows update, which today looks at some substantial dip-buying in the largest technology-focused ETF, along with a new fund that specifically targets so-called “FAANG” stocks.




There has been some notable inflow action in the Tech-heavy QQQ on the recent dip, as we have seen more than $2.2 billion flow into the fund as the index follows through strongly today (up nearly 1% as we approach midday).
Top holdings are presently AAPL (11.66%), MSFT (8.21%), AMZN (7.11%), FB (5.47%), GOOG (4.86%), and GOOGL (4.27%). With today’s surge, QQQ is once again trading above its 50 day moving average, a level that it has traded below for the past seven sessions.
Related to QQQ, and specifically “FAANG stocks” that have been popularized with the QQQ and other ETFs, and an IPO that is trading this morning is actively managed FNG (AdvisorShares New Tech & Media). This new fund’s top holdings are currently of NVDA (8.6%), FB (8.6%), AMZN (8.5%), BABA (5%), and GOOG (4.9%).
Fund literature describes FNG as follows:
“FNG’s investment thesis believes that high-performing technology and media leaders, popularly characterized as “FANG,” will continue to provide superior long-term performance. These disruptive innovators have created, acquired and refined current business models more successfully than others in the technology and media industries, establishing them as leaders on the forward edge. The portfolio manager seeks to identify additional constituents with similar characteristics using technical analysis, sampling and broad-based fundamental reviews to enhance the exposure of the portfolio.”
The PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) was trading at $140.35 per share on Wednesday morning, up $1.30 (+0.93%). Year-to-date, QQQ has gained 18.46%, versus a 9.04% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.
QQQ currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 34 ETFs in the Large Cap Growth ETFs category.

Top holdings are presently AAPL (11.66%), MSFT (8.21%), AMZN (7.11%), FB (5.47%), GOOG (4.86%), and GOOGL (4.27%). With today’s surge, QQQ is once again trading above its 50 day moving average, a level that it has traded below for the past seven sessions.
Related to QQQ, and specifically “FAANG stocks” that have been popularized with the QQQ and other ETFs, and an IPO that is trading this morning is actively managed FNG (AdvisorShares New Tech & Media). This new fund’s top holdings are currently of NVDA (8.6%), FB (8.6%), AMZN (8.5%), BABA (5%), and GOOG (4.9%).
Fund literature describes FNG as follows:
“FNG’s investment thesis believes that high-performing technology and media leaders, popularly characterized as “FANG,” will continue to provide superior long-term performance. These disruptive innovators have created, acquired and refined current business models more successfully than others in the technology and media industries, establishing them as leaders on the forward edge. The portfolio manager seeks to identify additional constituents with similar characteristics using technical analysis, sampling and broad-based fundamental reviews to enhance the exposure of the portfolio.”
The PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) was trading at $140.35 per share on Wednesday morning, up $1.30 (+0.93%). Year-to-date, QQQ has gained 18.46%, versus a 9.04% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.
QQQ currently has an ETF Daily News SMART Grade of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 34 ETFs in the Large Cap Growth ETFs category.

QQQ Fund Description
The PowerShares QQQ tracks a modified-market-cap-weighted index of 100 NASDAQ-listed stocks.
  
QQQ FactSet Analytics Insight
QQQ is one of the best established and most traded ETFs in the world. It's also one of the most unusual. Per the rules of its index, the fund only invests in nonfinancial stocks listed on NASDAQ, and effectively ignores other sectors too, causing it to skew massively away from a broad-based large-cap portfolio. QQQ has huge tech exposure, but it is not a 'tech fund' in the pure sense either. The fund's arcane weighting rules further distance it from anything close to plain vanilla large-cap or pure-play tech coverage. The ETF is much more concentrated in its top holdings and is more volatile than our vanilla large-cap benchmark. Still, it is extremely large and liquid, and has huge name recognition for the underlying index, the NASDAQ-100. In all, QQQ delivers a quirky but wildly popular mash-up of tech, growth and large-cap exposure.



QQQ MSCI ESG Fund metrics Insight
The MSCI ESG Fund Quality Score measures the ability of ETF underlying holdings to manage key medium to long-term risks and opportunities arising from environmental, social, and governance factors, as determined by MSCI ESG Research LLC. As of July 20, 2017 the PowerShares QQQ Trust MSCI ESG Fund Quality Score is 5.29 out of 10.The fund’s Peer Rank reflects the ranking of a fund’s MSCI ESG Fund Quality Score against the scores of other funds within the same peer group, as defined by the Thomson Reuters Lipper Global Classification. QQQ ranks in the 86th percentile within its peer group and in the 48th percentile within the global universe of all funds in MSCI ESG Fund Metrics coverage.

Here’s where a storm’s a-comin’ for investors, this global forecast says

Jul. 20, 2017 at 8:51 a.m. ET
by Victor Reklaitis









Surging Netflix puts Nasdaq on pace for longest win streak in 2 years
The Nasdaq Composite Index on Tuesday was on track to book its longest streak of gains in more than two years and its first record close in about a month, highlighting a steady climb for the tech-centric benchmark, and a rebound in popular trades like Netflix Inc. . Most recently, the Nasdaq  was trading in record territory and on track to mark its longest string of gains, at eight sessions in a row, since the 10-session period ended Feb. 24, 2015, according to the WSJ Market Data Group. The gauge had been wrestling with an extended downturn in technology shares since June 8, when the sector began a monthlong slump amid fears the high-flying group, including names like Facebook Inc. , Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. , Netflix, and Alphabet-parent Google Inc. , were rising too far, too fast. However, those companies and the tech benchmark has been recently rebounding from its June lows, with a recent batch of second-quarter earnings from Netflix helping to bolster sentiment in those growth names Overall, the Nasdaq Composite was trading up 0.4%, above its all-time closing high of 6,321.76 set June 8, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average  was down about 0.3%, pressured by a slump in shares of Goldman Sachs , while the S&P 500 index  was trading flat. The popular tech-focused, exchange-traded Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF also was trending higher and facing its own eight-session streak, as was the PowerShares QQQ Trust Series 1 , which is designed to mimic the performance of the large-cap Nasdaq-100 index .

Nasdaq challenges major support amid geopolitical tensions, S&P 500 nails 50-day average
Technically speaking, familiar late second-quarter, and very early third-quarter cross currents, remain in play across the major U.S. benchmarks.  Against this backdrop, Nasdaq Composite support, circa 6,100, marks a headline technical test — and is under siege early Thursday — while the S&P 500 has nailed its 50-day moving average, currently 2,413.6.

S&P 500 nails the 2,405 support amid volatile second-quarter conclusion
Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks are concluding the second quarter against a slightly bending, but still bullish, bigger-picture backdrop.  Consider that the S&P 500 has nailed the breakout point — S&P 2,405 — and rallied respectably, preserving its uptrend.  Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite has been more firmly pressured, edging under its 50-day moving average, currently 6,154, and the retest remains underway.

S&P 500, Dow nail near-term support, absorb ECB-fueled June downdraft
Technically speaking, the U.S. benchmarks have absorbed a second June whipsaw, in this case fueled by possibly inadvertent ECB policy language.  In the process, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials have more or less nailed the range bottom — S&P 2,416 and Dow 21,305 — rising respectably from support early Wednesday.

Stock Benchmarks March to Different Tunes
What did the market do today? The answer to this simple question has become more difficult in recent weeks, as the typically close relationship between the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 has broken down.

Jul. 10, 2017 at 9:06 a.m. ET
on The Wall Street Journal









Don’t Fade a Market With Long-Term Momentum
The S&P 500 has climbed in each of the first six months of this year, a feat not accomplished for more than two decades. History is no guarantee, of course, but the last two times the S&P jumped every month in the first half of the year, the index went on to gain at least 12% to close out the year.

on The Wall Street Journal









Traders See Rocky Trading Ahead for Tech Stocks
Traders expect big moves in tech stocks at the same time as placid trading for the broader U.S. stock market. That's the implication of a rare disconnect between the expected volatility of the Nasdaq 100 Index and the S&P 500, another sign of uncertainty that 2017's biggest winner can continue to gallop higher.

Jul. 5, 2017 at 12:41 p.m. ET
on The Wall Street Journal









First-Half Stock Performance — By the Numbers
It was a mostly mild ride for stocks in the first half but the strong run was capped by turbulence this week. For some analysts, a bout of turbulence could be a harbinger for more volatility in the second half of the year.

Jun. 30, 2017 at 5:50 p.m. ET
on The Wall Street Journal









Charts Will Be Key for Tech’s Next Move
Tech stocks are poised to end the first half of the year on a muted note, down 4.4% from its intraday high hit earlier in June. Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. are all down more than 5% from their recent highs, enough to represent a “pullback.”

Jun. 30, 2017 at 9:17 a.m. ET
on The Wall Street Journal









Nasdaq Defies Gravity
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index hasn’t had a peak-to-trough decline of 5% since before November’s election, a span of 158 days. That’s the longest streak for the Nasdaq without such a pullback since 1989, surpassing all stretches during the heady days of the late 1990s dot-com boom.

Fully 57% of investors said global internet stocks look “expensive,” while an additional 18% characterized the group as “bubble-like," according June's investor survey conducted by Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Rotation Out of Tech Stocks Continues
Friday's tech swoon could go down as a key pivot point for the U.S. stock market that has been propelled to new highs in 2017 in large part because of blockbuster stock gains for Apple, Amazon,Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft. Heading into Friday, these five stocks had accounted for 41% of the S&P 500's market capitalization gain for the year.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

Overview of the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment ETF | Direxion


























 






























Why KNOW? Why now?
Since inception, the Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares ETF (Ticker: KNOW) has outperfomed the major U.S. stock indexes including the: S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, S&P SmallCap 600 and S&P1500 (source: Morningstar Direct). 
It makes sense. Corporate insiders− top officers, boards of directors, and major shareholders − have a natural edge over retail investors, and even financial analysts, because they typically know their businesses and industries better than anyone. That’s why, no matter how much research you do, or how much financial news you consume, you’re always a step behind those “in the know”.
The Direxion All Cap Insider Sentiment Shares (KNOW) is designed to help long term-investors pursue better portfolio outcomes by using insider sentiment to seek alpha relative to S&P 500® Index.
With a net expense ratio of just 0.65%, this strategic index-based ETF provides investors with cost-effective access to stocks that corporate officers, directors, and shareholders who own more than 5% of each company’s stock, are accumulating.
This insider sentiment selection uses a screening methodology based on public-company filings and positive earnings analysis that provides the basis for the funds’ quantitatively-weighted indexes. The ETF is comprised of 100 companies selected from the S&P 1500 Index.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
