But the truth is, as the singer puts it, "This isn't so much a departure as it is me getting back to who I really am." The colorful mix of material (from the rousing, gospel-influenced "Back to Life" by superstar pop songwriter Kara DioGuardi to Eder's own explosive, very personal blues-rocker "Waiting for the Fall") and loose and high-spirited arrangements reflect the kind of music that moved her as a child, when she first started playing the guitar and writing songs. Musically, she and producer Billy Jay Stein back up with great integrity and passion her assertion that stepping into the ballgown and singing standards is like playing a role, while this rootsy music is more natural for her. Although the album was released by the great jazz label Verve, songs like the uptempo country jam "Pieces," the jangling "Prayer for Love," and the largely acoustic ballad "If You Believe (The Way I Do)" would find a joyful home on mainstream country radio.

Linda shows her hiding face!!
I have to say I really enjoyed listening to this CD. I discover Linda Eder some years ago and, as every listener I suppose, was used to her standards.
His CD is so much different. She does no longer show her technique or power range, but takes a "soft" countrier style that remains the entire album.
Casually, this may be the only problem I found on this record... songs could sound a bit similar the first times, but after listening to them deeply, you will discover each one is much more different than the rest.

Simple, easy, & realistic lyrics-something for ever
Linda Eder-The Other Side of Me  This CD was just released on September 30, and this is her 10th CD.  She has appeared on Broadway, and has sung at Carnegie Hall.  She started her singing career in 1991, and has been going strong ever since.  Although she only wrote one song on the CD-“Waiting for the Fall”, she does plan on writing more in the future.  “The Other Side of Me” has a hint of country.  The lyrics are simple, easy to understand, and realistic.  Her voice reminds me of a cross of Sugarland, and Melissa Ethridge minus the gravel.   My favorite song is Pieces, which is about being over someone, having had enough of them, and  not picking up the pieces anymore, so is a very nice twist.  Most of the songs are easy to dance to, and there are several ballads on the CD, so there should be something for everyone!

A different side of Linda Eder
Although I love Linda's work and have all of her previous CDs, I have to admit that this isn't my favorite. However, even this CD is far superior to many other CDs that I have purchased by other artists. I would listen to her sing the phone book.

Overview



Linda Eder, one of the greatest voices of our time, reunites with Frank Wildhorn on
Now, marking the musical return of this legendary team. After six years apart, Eder and Wildhorn collaborate to recapture the magic that began over two decades ago with the international smash hit Jekyll & Hyde. Linda's voice is the perfect compliment to Wildhorn's compositions, and Now is the album the world has been waiting for. 

Now features signature Wildhorn music in collaboration with many of the acclaimed lyricists he has worked with over the years, including Leslie Bricusse (Jekyll & Hyde), Don Black (Sunset Boulevard), Maury Yeston (Nine), among others. Of special note is the track "The Mad Hatter," from Wildhorn's highly anticipated Broadway show Wonderland (opening April 2011).

CD DetailsReleased: October 13, 2009
Originally Released: 2009
Label: Verve

Entertainment Reviews:


JazzTimes - p.74"Slowing the Beatles' 'Help' to a disheartened crawl to lay bare the lyric's desperation -- while again letting those bucolic underpinnings show -- is inspired."




Tracks:


1.I Will Wait for You
2.Accidentally in Love
3.Falling Slowly [from Once]
4.Against All Odds
5.Charade
6.If I Can't Have You
7.Help
8.Can't Help Falling in Love
9.Everybody's Talking
10.Valley of the Dolls
11.(Everything I Do) I Do It for You



Product Description:



Personnel: Linda Eder (vocals); Peter White , Ben Butler (guitar); Pamela Sixfin, David Davidson , David Angell (violin); Kristin Wilkinson (viola); John Catchings (cello); Sam Levine (flute, alto flute); Mickey Raphael (harmonica); Roger M. Weissmeyer (oboe, English horn); Jennifer Kummer (French horn); Barry Green, Kim Scharnberg (trombone); Billy Jay Stein (piano, keyboards); Jerry Marotta (drums); Gene Miller (background vocals).Audio Mixer: Trina Shoemaker.Recording information: Dreamland Recording, West Hurley, NY; House Of Blues, Nashville, TN; Strange Cranium Studios.Photographer: Caroline Knopf.On The Other Side of Me, her first album for Verve, Linda Eder branched out from her show music environment to dabble in country. Soundtrack, her second Verve release, consists of movie songs, which might suggest she is returning to her familiar style. But the collection of 11 tracks is sufficiently unusual in terms of selection and musical arrangements to mark another step into unknown territory for the singer. She and producer Peter Collins appear to have decided to limit their choices to movies released during Eder's lifetime, which means that the 48-year-old looks back as far as the Elvis Presley standard "Can't Help Falling in Love" from 1961's Blue Hawaii and as near as the Oscar-winning "Falling Slowly" from 2007's Once. And Eder has not returned to string-filled traditional pop arrangements, preferring small band jazz and folk-pop treatments. So, for example, the lead-off song, "I Will Wait for You," is given a low-key, jazzy accompaniment, and "Charade" is treated as if it were being played by Django Reinhardt & the Hot Club of France, while "Everybody's Talking" is rendered as a samba. Many of the performances have a downcast or even mournful tone, as Eder sings plaintively, often either with her own overdubbed harmony voice or a background singer joining her on individual lines. When love is the subject, it is a little desperate ("Against All Odds," "If I Can't Have You"), and sometimes the subject is the singer's own psychological distress ("Help," "Valley of the Dolls"). Maybe that's reflective of where the movies have been at during her life, or maybe she's drawing a pessimistic tone out of her choices. Either way, Soundtrack is an album of moody music from the movies. ~ William Ruhlmann
