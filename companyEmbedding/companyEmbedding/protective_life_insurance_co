Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity.

Life without Alex 
Alex’s family needs $4k a month to manage the bills so that his wife can continue to care for the kids as planned.




Goal To support his family after he’s gone. Alex wants to provide enough to pay the mortgage and everyday expenses until the children are out of school.

With Lifely Term, Alex can provide $4k a month for 20 years, to help support his family during what would have been his working years.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Life Insurance Helps the Ones You Love with:

Mortgage Payments

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If you initiate arbitration, Healthplans.com will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA Rules once you have notified Healthplans.com in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings.

If for any reason the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum. The arbitration will be conducted in the city of Los Angeles, California, but may proceed telephonically if the claimant so chooses.
The arbitrator’s award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under these Terms may be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court located to enforce these Terms or prevent an infringement of a third party’s rights.

BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT YOU MAY HAVE TO JOIN CLAIMS WITH THOSE OF OTHERS or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any claim submitted to arbitration. The parties to this arbitration agreement acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Healthplans.com IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.
You shall have thirty (30) days from the date that you submit your personally identifiable information to opt-out of this arbitration agreement. To opt out of arbitration you must email us at legal@healthplans.com. If more than thirty (30) days have passed, you are not eligible to opt out of arbitration.

The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If you initiate arbitration, Healthplans.com will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA Rules once you have notified Healthplans.com in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings.

The parties to this arbitration agreement acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Healthplans.com IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.
You shall have thirty (30) days from the date that you submit your personally identifiable information to opt-out of this arbitration agreement.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

Term Life Insurance
A Term Life policy offers coverage only if death occurs during a specific period of time, which coincides with the terms in which the insured member is required to make a monthly premium. A Term Life policy pays a benefit to the beneficiaries only if the policy holder dies during the time period for which the policy was initially contracted and has remained current on their annual or monthly premium payments.
This type of policy is beneficial for parents of young children, people with debt obligations and also home buyers. It can be renewed after the initial term has ended and it may also be converted to a whole life policy. The premiums are based on your age and your health status. Purchasing a new Term policy at the expiration of your existing policy will result in a higher premium and you may not qualify if you have disqualifying health issues.
Term Life is a "death benefit only" policy that you buy for a specified length of time. Think of it like leasing a car: you pay for the use of the car for a specified period and when the contract period is over, you return the car.
Term Life is referred to as "benefit only" insurance because unlike the various types of permanent life such as Whole Life, it carries no "cash surrender value". Because of this, Term Life insurance premiums tend to be very affordable. Young and relatively healthy individuals can often obtain a policy with limited or no medical background check. It is ideal for families that are just starting out, or for the family income provider who wants to make sure his or her family will be protected, but may not be able to afford, or desire a permanent life policy. However, understand that as a person ages over the period of the term, monthly premiums may increase.
It is often an ideal option to insure a second spouse, or for single people, even for children, just to make sure the often unexpectedly expensive costs of a funeral are covered. There are many insurance and financial professionals who suggest that those who purchase a Term Life policy can make up for the investment component of a Permanent Life insurance policy by investing the cost savings between the two on their own.
The earlier you purchase a term life policy and the healthier you are, the cheaper the premiums will be over the term of the policy.
Annual Renewable Term Life policies are those that are purchased year-by-year. The next year you do not have to prequalify. Simply choose to renew at what may or may not be an increased rate. Rates for Annual Renewable policies are at historic lows. A young healthy person can get $250,000.00 for only a few hundred dollars per year.
There are very good rates these days on Term Life. The premium is fixed and will not go up for the life of the term, usually 10,15, 20 or 30 years. It is not uncommon for a healthy non-smoking 40 year-old male to obtain a 20 or 30-year policy with a fixed premium of less than $30 per month.
So just how much Insurance should you buy? Many things factor into that answer, but at the minimum the experts say purchase enough insurance to equal at least 5-7 years of your present salary. If you have young children, make that around 10 years. So, if you make $50,000 a year that means at least $250,000 to $500,000 in coverage. Feel free to use our Life Insurance Calculator to help determine the right amount for your circumstances.
Term Life Insurance is an affordable life insurance product to ensure that your loved ones are protected in the event of your unexpected death, for a specific term period of time.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If you initiate arbitration, Healthplans.com will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA Rules once you have notified Healthplans.com in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings.

The parties to this arbitration agreement acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Healthplans.com IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.
You shall have thirty (30) days from the date that you submit your personally identifiable information to opt-out of this arbitration agreement.

When do I need life insurance?

Major life events affect your life insurance needs. You might consider layering policies to have more coverage at certain times - such as when you have children at home or when you’re starting a business.  






























Life Insurance Trigger Events to Consider 


























 

New Job 

   

Employer-provided life insurance can't always go with you, but a personal policy will not be dependent upon your employment status.  
























 

Home Purchase 

   

Taking on a mortgage means you need to evaluate whether you have enough coverage to offset this new debt.  
























 

Marriage/ Divorce 

   

From reviewing the amount of coverage to changing beneficiaries, marriage or divorce is a critical time to reevaluate your life insurance needs.  




























 

Baby 

   

More kids likely means you need more coverage. You'll want to plan for your child's future financial needs.  
























 

New Business 

   

Covering a business owner can allow for a smooth transition if the worst happens.  
























 

Retirement 

   

You may find that life insurance becomes less about insuring your income and more about protecting assets as you near retirement.

When do I need life insurance?

Major life events affect your life insurance needs. You might consider layering policies to have more coverage at certain times - such as when you have children at home or when you’re starting a business.  






























Life Insurance Trigger Events to Consider 


























 

New Job 

   

Employer-provided life insurance can't always go with you, but a personal policy will not be dependent upon your employment status.  
























 

Home Purchase 

   

Taking on a mortgage means you need to evaluate whether you have enough coverage to offset this new debt.  
























 

Marriage/ Divorce 

   

From reviewing the amount of coverage to changing beneficiaries, marriage or divorce is a critical time to reevaluate your life insurance needs.  




























 

Baby 

   

More kids likely means you need more coverage. You'll want to plan for your child's future financial needs.  
























 

New Business 

   

Covering a business owner can allow for a smooth transition if the worst happens.  
























 

Retirement 

   

You may find that life insurance becomes less about insuring your income and more about protecting assets as you near retirement.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Goal To support his family after he’s gone. Alex wants to provide enough to pay the mortgage and everyday expenses until the children are out of school.




How Lifely Term can help 
With Lifely Term, Alex can provide $4k a month for 20 years, to help support his family during what would have been his working years.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

History[edit]
In 1907, former Alabama governor William Dorsey Jelks founded Protective Life Insurance Company, and in 1909, Protective Life paid its first death claim.[3] In 1927, Protective merged with Alabama National Insurance Company, and Alabama National’s president, Samuel Clabaugh, became the president of the combined companies, which continued to do business as Protective.[3] In 1937, Clabaugh turned over the leadership of the company to Col. William J. Rushton, and in 1969, Col. Rushton’s son, William “Billy” J. Rushton III, became president of Protective.[3] The younger Rushton then presided over a series of acquisitions that led Protective into all 50 states.[3] As part of this push, Drayton Nabers Jr. became CEO in 1992 and in 1993, Protective Life Corporation was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PL.[3] In 1997, Protective Life acquired West Coast Life. Nabers retired in 2002 and Harvard Business School graduate John D. Johns was then named president and CEO of Protective Life.[3] John D. Johns has served as president and chief executive officer since 2002 and has been chairman of the board since January 2003. Johns has been a director since May 1997 and an employee of the company and its subsidiaries since 1993. In 2007, Protective Life celebrated its 100th anniversary, just one year after its acquisition of Chase Insurance Group in 2006.[4] In 2013, Protective’s principal subsidiary, Protective Life Insurance Company completed the acquisition of MONY Life Insurance Company and reinsured certain policies of MONY Life Insurance Company of America.[5] The total transaction price was $1.06 billion.[5] Protective Life has offices in Alabama, California, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Tennessee.[1] Protective Life Corporation was acquired by The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited (Tokyo, Japan) on February 15, 2015.

History[edit]
In 1907, former Alabama governor William Dorsey Jelks founded Protective Life Insurance Company, and in 1909, Protective Life paid its first death claim.[3] In 1927, Protective merged with Alabama National Insurance Company, and Alabama National’s president, Samuel Clabaugh, became the president of the combined companies, which continued to do business as Protective.[3] In 1937, Clabaugh turned over the leadership of the company to Col. William J. Rushton, and in 1969, Col. Rushton’s son, William “Billy” J. Rushton III, became president of Protective.[3] The younger Rushton then presided over a series of acquisitions that led Protective into all 50 states.[3] As part of this push, Drayton Nabers Jr. became CEO in 1992 and in 1993, Protective Life Corporation was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol PL.[3] In 1997, Protective Life acquired West Coast Life. Nabers retired in 2002 and Harvard Business School graduate John D. Johns was then named president and CEO of Protective Life.[3] John D. Johns has served as president and chief executive officer since 2002 and has been chairman of the board since January 2003. Johns has been a director since May 1997 and an employee of the company and its subsidiaries since 1993. In 2007, Protective Life celebrated its 100th anniversary, just one year after its acquisition of Chase Insurance Group in 2006.[4] In 2013, Protective’s principal subsidiary, Protective Life Insurance Company completed the acquisition of MONY Life Insurance Company and reinsured certain policies of MONY Life Insurance Company of America.[5] The total transaction price was $1.06 billion.[5] Protective Life has offices in Alabama, California, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Tennessee.[1] Protective Life Corporation was acquired by The Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company, Limited (Tokyo, Japan) on February 15, 2015.
Leadership and board of directors[edit]
Protective Life Corporation leadership includes John D. Johns (chairman and CEO), Richard J. Bielen (president and COO), Scott Adams (EVP, Chief Administrative Officer), Deborah J. Long, JD (EVP, Chief Legal Officer and secretary), Mike Temple (EVP, Finance and Risk and CRO), Carl S. Thigpen (EVP and CIO), and Steven G. Walker (EVP, CFO, and Controller).[6]
The company’s board of directors include John D. Johns, Richard J. Bielen, John J. McMahon, Jr. Jesse J. Spikes, Shigeo Tsuyuki, Shinichi Aizawa, Vanessa Leonard, Ungyong (Inkyo) Shu, William A. Terry, and W. Michael Warren, Jr.[7]
Operations[edit]
The company offers plans in:[4]

Life insurance, including universal life, variable universal life, and bank-owned life insurance products offered through a network of brokers, stockbrokers and independent marketing organizations.
Annuities, including fixed and variable annuity products sold through broker-dealers, financial institutions and brokers.
Stable value products, including fixed and floating-rate funding agreements sold to the trustees of municipal bond proceeds, institutional investors, bank trust departments and money market funds.
Asset protection, marketing extended service contracts and credit life and disability insurance to protect consumers’ investments in automobiles, watercraft and recreational vehicles.
Acquisitions, consisting of policies originated by other companies and later acquired by Protective. The segment’s primary focus is on life insurance policies and annuity products that were sold to individuals.

Awards and recognition[edit]
Protective Life was awarded the 2010 Optimas Award from Workforce Management Magazine and honored in the Partnership category by the Virgin HealthMiles employee wellness program.
Philanthropy[edit]
The company established the Protective Life Foundation, which supports education and healthy development of at-risk youth.[3] In addition, the foundation engages charitable activities to cultural organizations, civic and community initiatives, human services groups, and the United Way.[3]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
