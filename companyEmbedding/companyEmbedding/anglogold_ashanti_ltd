AngloGold Ashanti Comments on Passage of New Legislation in Tanzania

NEWS RELEASE
AngloGold Ashanti Comments on Passage of New Legislation in Tanzania
(PRESS RELEASE ? JOHANNESBURG) — AngloGold Ashanti notes the enactment by the
Republic of Tanzania?s Parliament and publication in the Country?s official Government
Gazette of the Natural Wealth and Resources (Permanent Sovereignty) Act, No 5 of 2017, the
Natural Wealth and Resources Contracts (Review and Re-Negotiation of Unconscionable
Terms) Act, No 6 of 2017 and the Written Laws (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act, No 7 of
2017.
AngloGold Ashanti?s indirect subsidiaries, Samax Resources Limited and Geita Gold Mining
Limited (the Subsidiaries), are parties to a Mine Development Agreement (MDA) in relation
to the development and operation of the Geita gold mine in Tanzania (Geita Mine), which
governs the relationship between the Subsidiaries and the Government of Tanzania (GoT) in
relation to Geita Mine. The MDA was instrumental in the decision to make the significant
investment in the development of Geita Mine, at a time of significantly lower gold prices and
when Tanzania was an untested jurisdiction for new mine development.
Since starting production almost two decades ago, Geita Mine has been a source of significant
benefit to all stakeholders, yielding more than $1 billion in monetary benefit to the GoT. Last
year alone, a total of $130 million in taxes was paid (borne and taxes collected on behalf of
Government) by Geita Mine.
The three pieces of new legislation in question purport to make a number of changes to the
operating environment for Tanzania?s extractive industries, including those in its mining, and
oil and gas sectors. These changes include, among others: the right for the GoT to renegotiate
existing MDAs at its discretion; the provision to the GoT of a non-dilutable, free-carried interest
of no less than 16% in all mining projects; the right for the Government to acquire up to 50%
of any mining asset commensurate with the value of tax benefits provided to the owner of that
asset by the GoT; removal of the refund of input VAT incurred; an increase in the rate of
revenue royalties from 4% to 6%; requirements for local beneficiation and procurement; and
constraints on the operation of off-shore bank accounts.
For a more detailed reading of the legislative provisions included in the new laws,
please see http://www.parliament.go.tz/bills-list.
AngloGold Ashanti?s subsidiaries are seeking a constructive dialogue with the GoT, and its
agencies, to gain assurances that Geita Mine will not be affected by these legal and fiscal
changes. In the circumstances, the Subsidiaries have, however, had no choice but to take the
precautionary step of safeguarding their interests under the MDA, by commencing arbitration
proceedings under the rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law,
as clearly provided for in the MDA.
Geita Mine employed an average of 3,748 people last year in permanent and contractor
provisions. The mine, which continues to operate normally, exports gold in the form of dore
bars and contributed an estimated $593 million in revenue to the output of the country as
measured by the gross domestic product in 2016.
About Geita Gold Mine
Geita Gold Mine produced 489 000oz at an all-in-sustaining cost of $844/oz in Tanzania in
2016, which amounted to 14% of AngloGold Ashanti?s total production.

concerning the economic outlook for the gold mining industry, expectations regarding gold prices, production, cash costs, all-in
sustaining costs, all-in costs, cost savings and other operating results, return on equity, productivity improvements, growth

AngloGold Ashanti?s actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated results, performance or
achievements expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. Although AngloGold Ashanti believes that the
expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements and forecasts are reasonable, no assurance can be given that such

and operational risk management.

all of the important factors that could cause AngloGold Ashanti?s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any

Company history[edit]
The company was formed on 26 April 2004, after the High Court of Ghana approved the merger of AngloGold and the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation three days earlier.[3] This came almost a year after the merger was announced on 16 May 2003. In the transaction, Ashanti shareholders received 0.29 ordinary shares of AngloGold for every Ashanti share.[4]
The new company sold its Union Reef Gold Mine in the Northern Territory of Australia in August 2004, followed by the sale of the Freda-Rebecca Gold Mine in Zimbabwe a month later.[4]
In late 2007, Mark Cutifani replaced Bobby Godsell as CEO of AngloGold Ashanti, being appointed a director of the company on 17 September 2007 and as CEO on 1 October that year.[5]
In January 2009, AngloGold Ashanti sold its 33% stake in the Boddington Gold Mine in Australia to Newmont Mining for US$1.0 billion.[6]
Russell Edey, chairman of AngloGold since 2002 and, after the merger also of AngloGold Ashanti, was replaced by Tito Mboweni in May 2010.[7] The company's Tau Lekoa Gold Mine in South Africa was sold to Buffelsfontein Gold Mines Limited in February 2009, with ownership being transferred on 1 August 2010.[8]
The company announced the elimination of the last of its hedge book in October 2010. The company had hedged 11.3 million ounces of gold, as of early 2008, under previous CEO Bobby Godsell. Under its new CEO, this was gradually reduced to 3.22 million. In October 2010, this remaining amount was paid off with US$2.63 billion, or US$1,300 per ounce of gold.[9]
AngloGold Ashanti is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.
Criticism[edit]
In August 2008 British charity War on Want published a report accusing AngloGold Ashanti's parent company Anglo American of profiting from the abuse of people in the developing countries in which the company operates.[10] The report alleges abuses committed by AngloGold Ashanti subsidiaries in Colombia, Ghana and Mali. War on Want stated that AngloGold Ashanti was accused in 2008 in Colombia of "murders of trade union and community leaders who opposed the company's activities in the region". The company disclosed itself in 2006 or in 2008 for unacceptable safety performance in its platinum mines. Safety measures were taken.[11] Additionally, in 2005 the staff of the AGA exploration team in Ituri made an US$8,000 payment to the FNI, which had been accused of committing various humans rights abuses.[12]
In January 2011, AngloGold Ashanti was named the world's "Most Irresponsible Company" at the Public Eye Awards hosted with Greenpeace in Davos, Switzerland by the Erklärung von Bern, known in English as the Berne Convention. The nominating organisation, WACAM (Wassa Association of Communities Affected by Mining), said the company had a history of "gross human rights violations and environmental problems."[13]

Fatalities[edit]
Fatalities in the South African gold mining industry, especially the underground mines, are common. As of 2009, 100 to 120 were reported every year. This did represent an improvement since 2007: AngloGold Ashanti has reduced the number of fatalities in its operations by 70%. One of the main reasons for this development was a program led by CEO Mark Cutifani aimed at reducing the company's number of fatalities to zero by 2015.[19] Of the 16 fatalities experienced by the company in 2009, 13 were in South Africa (2007: 27 of 34, 2008: 11 of 14).[1] Statistics company fatalities since 2004 founding:

Fatalities[edit]
Fatalities in the South African gold mining industry, especially the underground mines, are common. As of 2009, 100 to 120 were reported every year. This did represent an improvement since 2007: AngloGold Ashanti has reduced the number of fatalities in its operations by 70%. One of the main reasons for this development was a program led by CEO Mark Cutifani aimed at reducing the company's number of fatalities to zero by 2015.[19] Of the 16 fatalities experienced by the company in 2009, 13 were in South Africa (2007: 27 of 34, 2008: 11 of 14).[1] Statistics company fatalities since 2004 founding:

Company history[edit]
The company was formed on 26 April 2004, after the High Court of Ghana approved the merger of AngloGold and the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation three days earlier.[3] This came almost a year after the merger was announced on 16 May 2003. In the transaction, Ashanti shareholders received 0.29 ordinary shares of AngloGold for every Ashanti share.[4]
The new company sold its Union Reef Gold Mine in the Northern Territory of Australia in August 2004, followed by the sale of the Freda-Rebecca Gold Mine in Zimbabwe a month later.[4]
In late 2007, Mark Cutifani replaced Bobby Godsell as CEO of AngloGold Ashanti, being appointed a director of the company on 17 September 2007 and as CEO on 1 October that year.[5]
In January 2009, AngloGold Ashanti sold its 33% stake in the Boddington Gold Mine in Australia to Newmont Mining for US$1.0 billion.[6]
Russell Edey, chairman of AngloGold since 2002 and, after the merger also of AngloGold Ashanti, was replaced by Tito Mboweni in May 2010.[7] The company's Tau Lekoa Gold Mine in South Africa was sold to Buffelsfontein Gold Mines Limited in February 2009, with ownership being transferred on 1 August 2010.[8]
The company announced the elimination of the last of its hedge book in October 2010. The company had hedged 11.3 million ounces of gold, as of early 2008, under previous CEO Bobby Godsell. Under its new CEO, this was gradually reduced to 3.22 million. In October 2010, this remaining amount was paid off with US$2.63 billion, or US$1,300 per ounce of gold.[9]
AngloGold Ashanti is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.
Criticism[edit]
In August 2008 British charity War on Want published a report accusing AngloGold Ashanti's parent company Anglo American of profiting from the abuse of people in the developing countries in which the company operates.[10] The report alleges abuses committed by AngloGold Ashanti subsidiaries in Colombia, Ghana and Mali. War on Want stated that AngloGold Ashanti was accused in 2008 in Colombia of "murders of trade union and community leaders who opposed the company's activities in the region". The company disclosed itself in 2006 or in 2008 for unacceptable safety performance in its platinum mines. Safety measures were taken.[11] Additionally, in 2005 the staff of the AGA exploration team in Ituri made an US$8,000 payment to the FNI, which had been accused of committing various humans rights abuses.[12]
In January 2011, AngloGold Ashanti was named the world's "Most Irresponsible Company" at the Public Eye Awards hosted with Greenpeace in Davos, Switzerland by the Erklärung von Bern, known in English as the Berne Convention. The nominating organisation, WACAM (Wassa Association of Communities Affected by Mining), said the company had a history of "gross human rights violations and environmental problems."[13]

Company history[edit]
The company was formed on 26 April 2004, after the High Court of Ghana approved the merger of AngloGold and the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation three days earlier.[3] This came almost a year after the merger was announced on 16 May 2003. In the transaction, Ashanti shareholders received 0.29 ordinary shares of AngloGold for every Ashanti share.[4]
The new company sold its Union Reef Gold Mine in the Northern Territory of Australia in August 2004, followed by the sale of the Freda-Rebecca Gold Mine in Zimbabwe a month later.[4]
In late 2007, Mark Cutifani replaced Bobby Godsell as CEO of AngloGold Ashanti, being appointed a director of the company on 17 September 2007 and as CEO on 1 October that year.[5]
In January 2009, AngloGold Ashanti sold its 33% stake in the Boddington Gold Mine in Australia to Newmont Mining for US$1.0 billion.[6]
Russell Edey, chairman of AngloGold since 2002 and, after the merger also of AngloGold Ashanti, was replaced by Tito Mboweni in May 2010.[7] The company's Tau Lekoa Gold Mine in South Africa was sold to Buffelsfontein Gold Mines Limited in February 2009, with ownership being transferred on 1 August 2010.[8]
The company announced the elimination of the last of its hedge book in October 2010. The company had hedged 11.3 million ounces of gold, as of early 2008, under previous CEO Bobby Godsell. Under its new CEO, this was gradually reduced to 3.22 million. In October 2010, this remaining amount was paid off with US$2.63 billion, or US$1,300 per ounce of gold.[9]
AngloGold Ashanti is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.
Criticism[edit]
In August 2008 British charity War on Want published a report accusing AngloGold Ashanti's parent company Anglo American of profiting from the abuse of people in the developing countries in which the company operates.[10] The report alleges abuses committed by AngloGold Ashanti subsidiaries in Colombia, Ghana and Mali. War on Want stated that AngloGold Ashanti was accused in 2008 in Colombia of "murders of trade union and community leaders who opposed the company's activities in the region". The company disclosed itself in 2006 or in 2008 for unacceptable safety performance in its platinum mines. Safety measures were taken.[11] Additionally, in 2005 the staff of the AGA exploration team in Ituri made an US$8,000 payment to the FNI, which had been accused of committing various humans rights abuses.[12]
In January 2011, AngloGold Ashanti was named the world's "Most Irresponsible Company" at the Public Eye Awards hosted with Greenpeace in Davos, Switzerland by the Erklärung von Bern, known in English as the Berne Convention. The nominating organisation, WACAM (Wassa Association of Communities Affected by Mining), said the company had a history of "gross human rights violations and environmental problems."[13]

Fatalities[edit]
Fatalities in the South African gold mining industry, especially the underground mines, are common. As of 2009, 100 to 120 were reported every year. This did represent an improvement since 2007: AngloGold Ashanti has reduced the number of fatalities in its operations by 70%. One of the main reasons for this development was a program led by CEO Mark Cutifani aimed at reducing the company's number of fatalities to zero by 2015.[19] Of the 16 fatalities experienced by the company in 2009, 13 were in South Africa (2007: 27 of 34, 2008: 11 of 14).[1] Statistics company fatalities since 2004 founding:

In January 2009, AngloGold Ashanti sold its 33% stake in the Boddington Gold Mine in Australia to Newmont Mining for US$1.0 billion.[6]
Russell Edey, chairman of AngloGold since 2002 and, after the merger also of AngloGold Ashanti, was replaced by Tito Mboweni in May 2010.[7] The company's Tau Lekoa Gold Mine in South Africa was sold to Buffelsfontein Gold Mines Limited in February 2009, with ownership being transferred on 1 August 2010.[8]
The company announced the elimination of the last of its hedge book in October 2010. The company had hedged 11.3 million ounces of gold, as of early 2008, under previous CEO Bobby Godsell. Under its new CEO, this was gradually reduced to 3.22 million. In October 2010, this remaining amount was paid off with US$2.63 billion, or US$1,300 per ounce of gold.[9]
AngloGold Ashanti is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.
Criticism[edit]
In August 2008 British charity War on Want published a report accusing AngloGold Ashanti's parent company Anglo American of profiting from the abuse of people in the developing countries in which the company operates.[10] The report alleges abuses committed by AngloGold Ashanti subsidiaries in Colombia, Ghana and Mali. War on Want stated that AngloGold Ashanti was accused in 2008 in Colombia of "murders of trade union and community leaders who opposed the company's activities in the region". The company disclosed itself in 2006 or in 2008 for unacceptable safety performance in its platinum mines. Safety measures were taken.[11] Additionally, in 2005 the staff of the AGA exploration team in Ituri made an US$8,000 payment to the FNI, which had been accused of committing various humans rights abuses.[12]
In January 2011, AngloGold Ashanti was named the world's "Most Irresponsible Company" at the Public Eye Awards hosted with Greenpeace in Davos, Switzerland by the Erklärung von Bern, known in English as the Berne Convention. The nominating organisation, WACAM (Wassa Association of Communities Affected by Mining), said the company had a history of "gross human rights violations and environmental problems."[13]

Fatalities[edit]
Fatalities in the South African gold mining industry, especially the underground mines, are common. As of 2009, 100 to 120 were reported every year. This did represent an improvement since 2007: AngloGold Ashanti has reduced the number of fatalities in its operations by 70%. One of the main reasons for this development was a program led by CEO Mark Cutifani aimed at reducing the company's number of fatalities to zero by 2015.[19] Of the 16 fatalities experienced by the company in 2009, 13 were in South Africa (2007: 27 of 34, 2008: 11 of 14).[1] Statistics company fatalities since 2004 founding:

Real-time prices are provided by Bats Exchange on individual U.S. equities quote pages. During market hours, the real-time Bats price displays and new trade updates are updated on the page (as indicated by a "flash"). Volume always reflects consolidated markets. If the symbol has pre-market or post-market trades, that information will also be reflected along with the last (closing) price from the symbol's exchange. Real-time prices are available during market hours (9:30 AM to 4:00 PM EST).  Note: The Bats Exchange currently accounts for approximately 11-12% of all U.S. equity trading each day. As a result, the real-time prices displayed may have minor discrepancies when comparing the information with other sites offering real-time data, or with brokerage firms. If you require comprehensive real-time bids/asks/quotes, we offer a no-risk trial to one of our real-time products. Summary Quoteboard The Summary Quoteboard displays snapshot quote data. When available, Bid and Ask information from the Bats exchange is updated as new data is received. Volume is also updated but is the delayed consolidated Volume from the symbol's exchange. Quoteboard data fields include:  Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session. Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram. Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session. Bid: The last bid price and bid size. Ask: The last ask price and ask size. Volume: The total number of shares or contracts traded in the current trading session. Average Volume: The average number of shares traded over the last 20 days. Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.  Chart Snapshot A thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.Barchart Technical Opinion The Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overally Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy. A symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:  Strong Buy (greater than "66% Buy") Buy (greater than or equal to "33% Buy" and less than or equal to "66% Buy") Weak Buy ("0% Buy" through "33% Buy") Hold Strong Sell (greater than "66% Sell") Sell (greater than or equal to "33% Sell" and less than or equal to "66% Sell") Weak Sell ("0% Sell" through "33% Sell")  The current reading of the 14-Day Stochastic indicator is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:   If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 90 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is in highly overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal." If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is greater than 80 and the Overall Opinion is a Buy, the following displays: "The market is approaching overbought territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 10 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is in highly oversold territory. Beware of a trend reversal."  If the 14-Day Stochastic %K is less than 20 and the Overall Opinion is a Sell, the following displays: "The market is approaching oversold territory. Be watchful of a trend reversal." Business Summary Provides a general description of the business conducted by this company. Price Performance This section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the "See More" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.Fundamentals For US Stocks, the Overview page includes key statistics on the stock's fundamentals, with a link to see more. Most Recent Earnings figures are based on Non-GAAP income from continuing operations. Market Cap: capitalization or market value of a stock is simply the market value of all outstanding shares. It is computed by multiplying the market price by the number of outstanding shares. For example, a publicly held company with 10 million shares outstanding that trade at $10 each would have a market capitalization of $100 million. Shares Outstanding: Common shares outstanding as reported by the company on the 10-Q or 10-K. P/E Ratio: Latest closing price divided by the earnings-per-share based on the Latest 12-Month EPS Change (LTM) of earnings. Companies with negative earnings receive an "NE." EPS: The basic annual EPS from total operations is the bottom line income after all expenses, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For example, if a company has $10 million in net income and 10 million in outstanding shares, then its EPS is $1. Beta: 36 Month Beta: Coefficient that measures the volatility of a stock's returns relative to the market (S&P 500). It is based on a 36-month historical regression of the return on the stock onto the return on the S&P 500. Earnings: The amount of latest Earnings Per Share (EPS) paid out to shareholders. Dividend Yield: A portion of a company's profit paid to shareholders, quoted as the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share). Yield is the amount of dividends paid per share, divided by the closing price. Sectors: Links to the Industry Groups and/or SIC codes in which the stock is found.Support and Resistance This section shows a snapshot view of the Trader's Cheat Sheet with the Last Price, and four separate pivot points (2 Support Levels, and 2 Resistance Points). The Last Price shown is the last trade price at the time the quote page was displayed, and will not update every 10 seconds (as the Last Price at the top of the Quote page does). The Last Price will update only when the page is refreshed. Pivot points are used to identify intraday support, resistance and target levels. The pivot point and its support and resistance pairs are defined as follows, where H, L, C are the current day's high, low and close, respectively. Support and Resistance points are based on end-of-day prices and are intended for the current trading session if the market is open, or the next trading session if the market is closed.   Pivot Point: (P) = (H + L + C) / 3 First Resistance Level: (R1) = (2 * P) - L First Support Level: (S1) = (2 * P) - H Second Resistance Level: (R2) = P + (R1 - S1) Second Support Level: (S2) = P - (R1 - S1) Related Stocks For comparison purposes, find information on other symbols contained in the same sector.Most Recent Stories View the latest top stories from the Associated Press or Canadian Press (based on your Market selection).

Page Content (2nd)AngloGold Ashanti's Independent Strategic Marketing Initiatives
AngloGold Ashanti runs its own strategic marketing initiatives, focusing on leadership of the gold jewellery market in the areas of design innovation, branding, marketing and retail. The aim of these marketing initiatives is to drive positive demand trends through addressing structural weaknesses in the gold jewellery market through initiatives such as AuDITIONS.

AngloGold Ashanti AuDITIONS
AuDITIONS is a global gold jewellery design competition hosted biannually in Brazil and South Africa. AngloGold Ashanti has been involved in establishing, organising and sponsoring gold jewellery competitions in many different countries. These events staged under the AuDITIONS banner have encouraged original and striking contemporary gold jewellery design, thus serving as powerful tools for the group’s ongoing promotion of its product.
AuDITIONS Global
AuDITIONS Brazil

Beneficiation Initiatives

   AngloGold Ashanti has, over the years, committed itself to support the beneficiation of gold in its home market of South Africa. Beneficiation entails the provision of structural support to assist the growth and development of downstream industries in gold producing countries in which it operates.


Jewellery Sector Support

    AngloGold Ashanti committed to support the jewellery sector in its home markets, including South Africa, Brazil and now Ghana. Through initiatives in this area, AngloGold Ashanti provides structural support to assist the growth and development of downstream industries in the gold- producing countries in which it operates. Such a strategy is designed to assist traditionally mining-focused economies to increase the value added to gold mined prior to export and to promote and develop domestic demand for gold and gold products.

In South Africa, activities undertaken in this context have included: a 25% investment in South Africa's largest gold jewellery manufacturer, 
OroAfrica
, support for training projects such as the Soweto Jewellery School and Vukani Ubuntu as well as research into the gold value chain and support for a Gold Advance Scheme designed to facilitate cost-effective financing of gold inventory for the South African jewellery sector. 
In both South Africa and Brazil, AngloGold Ashanti has staged gold jewellery design competitions, now under the banner of  
AuDITIONS, to promote the development of gold jewellery design in these markets. Activities undertaken by AngloGold Ashanti Marketing Brazil have been diverse and have included funding for a gold alloy research laboratory at the Centre for the Study of Gem and Jewellery Design at the State University of Minas Gerais (UEMG) and support of the Zuzu Angel Fashion Institute in Rio de Janeiro, an institute which aims to promote key sections of the Brazilian economy, including the jewellery manufacturing sector, by harnessing local and flair creativity.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

AngloGold Ashanti Limited is a global gold mining company. It was formed in 2004 by the merger of AngloGold and the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation.
AngloGold Ashanti Limited is now a global gold producer with 21 operations on four continents. The company is listed on the New York, Johannesburg, Accra, London and Australian stock exchanges, as well as the Paris and Brussels bourses.
In 2008, AngloGold produced 4.98 million ounces of gold from its operations, estimated to be seven percent of the global production. In 2009, the company's gold output dropped to 4.6 million ounces.[1] As of the third quarter of 2014, Anglogold was the world's third-largest producer of gold, behind Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining.[2]

Company history[edit]
The company was formed on 26 April 2004, after the High Court of Ghana approved the merger of AngloGold and the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation three days earlier.[3] This came almost a year after the merger was announced on 16 May 2003. In the transaction, Ashanti shareholders received 0.29 ordinary shares of AngloGold for every Ashanti share.[4]
The new company sold its Union Reef Gold Mine in the Northern Territory of Australia in August 2004, followed by the sale of the Freda-Rebecca Gold Mine in Zimbabwe a month later.[4]
In late 2007, Mark Cutifani replaced Bobby Godsell as CEO of AngloGold Ashanti, being appointed a director of the company on 17 September 2007 and as CEO on 1 October that year.[5]
In January 2009, AngloGold Ashanti sold its 33% stake in the Boddington Gold Mine in Australia to Newmont Mining for US$1.0 billion.[6]
Russell Edey, chairman of AngloGold since 2002 and, after the merger also of AngloGold Ashanti, was replaced by Tito Mboweni in May 2010.[7] The company's Tau Lekoa Gold Mine in South Africa was sold to Buffelsfontein Gold Mines Limited in February 2009, with ownership being transferred on 1 August 2010.[8]
The company announced the elimination of the last of its hedge book in October 2010. The company had hedged 11.3 million ounces of gold, as of early 2008, under previous CEO Bobby Godsell. Under its new CEO, this was gradually reduced to 3.22 million. In October 2010, this remaining amount was paid off with US$2.63 billion, or US$1,300 per ounce of gold.[9]
AngloGold Ashanti is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.
Criticism[edit]
In August 2008 British charity War on Want published a report accusing AngloGold Ashanti's parent company Anglo American of profiting from the abuse of people in the developing countries in which the company operates.[10] The report alleges abuses committed by AngloGold Ashanti subsidiaries in Colombia, Ghana and Mali. War on Want stated that AngloGold Ashanti was accused in 2008 in Colombia of "murders of trade union and community leaders who opposed the company's activities in the region". The company disclosed itself in 2006 or in 2008 for unacceptable safety performance in its platinum mines. Safety measures were taken.[11] Additionally, in 2005 the staff of the AGA exploration team in Ituri made an US$8,000 payment to the FNI, which had been accused of committing various humans rights abuses.[12]
In January 2011, AngloGold Ashanti was named the world's "Most Irresponsible Company" at the Public Eye Awards hosted with Greenpeace in Davos, Switzerland by the Erklärung von Bern, known in English as the Berne Convention. The nominating organisation, WACAM (Wassa Association of Communities Affected by Mining), said the company had a history of "gross human rights violations and environmental problems."[13]

Figures for 2004 for Freda-Rebecca, Siguiri, Bibiani, Iduapriem and Obuasi are for the period from May to December, from the merger onwards, having belonged to Ashanti Goldfields Corporation before the merger.
Percentage figures behind names indicate the share of production of the mine belonging to AngloGold Ashanti. Production figures shown are those belonging to AngloGold Ashanti, not overall production.
1 The Bibiani Gold Mine was sold 1 December 2006.
2 The Moab Khotsong Gold Mine started production in 2006.
3 The Freda-Rebecca Gold Mine was sold 1 September 2004.
4 The Tau Lekoa Gold Mine was sold to Buffelsfontein Gold Mines Limited, with ownership being transferred on 1 August 2010.

Fatalities[edit]
Fatalities in the South African gold mining industry, especially the underground mines, are common. As of 2009, 100 to 120 were reported every year. This did represent an improvement since 2007: AngloGold Ashanti has reduced the number of fatalities in its operations by 70%. One of the main reasons for this development was a program led by CEO Mark Cutifani aimed at reducing the company's number of fatalities to zero by 2015.[19] Of the 16 fatalities experienced by the company in 2009, 13 were in South Africa (2007: 27 of 34, 2008: 11 of 14).[1] Statistics company fatalities since 2004 founding:

In 2008, AngloGold produced 4.98 million ounces of gold from its operations, estimated to be seven percent of the global production. In 2009, the company's gold output dropped to 4.6 million ounces.[1] As of the third quarter of 2014, Anglogold was the world's third-largest producer of gold, behind Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining.[2]

Company history[edit]
The company was formed on 26 April 2004, after the High Court of Ghana approved the merger of AngloGold and the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation three days earlier.[3] This came almost a year after the merger was announced on 16 May 2003. In the transaction, Ashanti shareholders received 0.29 ordinary shares of AngloGold for every Ashanti share.[4]
The new company sold its Union Reef Gold Mine in the Northern Territory of Australia in August 2004, followed by the sale of the Freda-Rebecca Gold Mine in Zimbabwe a month later.[4]
In late 2007, Mark Cutifani replaced Bobby Godsell as CEO of AngloGold Ashanti, being appointed a director of the company on 17 September 2007 and as CEO on 1 October that year.[5]
In January 2009, AngloGold Ashanti sold its 33% stake in the Boddington Gold Mine in Australia to Newmont Mining for US$1.0 billion.[6]
Russell Edey, chairman of AngloGold since 2002 and, after the merger also of AngloGold Ashanti, was replaced by Tito Mboweni in May 2010.[7] The company's Tau Lekoa Gold Mine in South Africa was sold to Buffelsfontein Gold Mines Limited in February 2009, with ownership being transferred on 1 August 2010.[8]
The company announced the elimination of the last of its hedge book in October 2010. The company had hedged 11.3 million ounces of gold, as of early 2008, under previous CEO Bobby Godsell. Under its new CEO, this was gradually reduced to 3.22 million. In October 2010, this remaining amount was paid off with US$2.63 billion, or US$1,300 per ounce of gold.[9]
AngloGold Ashanti is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.
Criticism[edit]
In August 2008 British charity War on Want published a report accusing AngloGold Ashanti's parent company Anglo American of profiting from the abuse of people in the developing countries in which the company operates.[10] The report alleges abuses committed by AngloGold Ashanti subsidiaries in Colombia, Ghana and Mali. War on Want stated that AngloGold Ashanti was accused in 2008 in Colombia of "murders of trade union and community leaders who opposed the company's activities in the region". The company disclosed itself in 2006 or in 2008 for unacceptable safety performance in its platinum mines. Safety measures were taken.[11] Additionally, in 2005 the staff of the AGA exploration team in Ituri made an US$8,000 payment to the FNI, which had been accused of committing various humans rights abuses.[12]
In January 2011, AngloGold Ashanti was named the world's "Most Irresponsible Company" at the Public Eye Awards hosted with Greenpeace in Davos, Switzerland by the Erklärung von Bern, known in English as the Berne Convention. The nominating organisation, WACAM (Wassa Association of Communities Affected by Mining), said the company had a history of "gross human rights violations and environmental problems."[13]

Fatalities[edit]
Fatalities in the South African gold mining industry, especially the underground mines, are common. As of 2009, 100 to 120 were reported every year. This did represent an improvement since 2007: AngloGold Ashanti has reduced the number of fatalities in its operations by 70%. One of the main reasons for this development was a program led by CEO Mark Cutifani aimed at reducing the company's number of fatalities to zero by 2015.[19] Of the 16 fatalities experienced by the company in 2009, 13 were in South Africa (2007: 27 of 34, 2008: 11 of 14).[1] Statistics company fatalities since 2004 founding:

AngloGold Ashanti Limited is a global gold mining company. It was formed in 2004 by the merger of AngloGold and the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation.
AngloGold Ashanti Limited is now a global gold producer with 21 operations on four continents. The company is listed on the New York, Johannesburg, Accra, London and Australian stock exchanges, as well as the Paris and Brussels bourses.
In 2008, AngloGold produced 4.98 million ounces of gold from its operations, estimated to be seven percent of the global production. In 2009, the company's gold output dropped to 4.6 million ounces.[1] As of the third quarter of 2014, Anglogold was the world's third-largest producer of gold, behind Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining.[2]

Company history[edit]
The company was formed on 26 April 2004, after the High Court of Ghana approved the merger of AngloGold and the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation three days earlier.[3] This came almost a year after the merger was announced on 16 May 2003. In the transaction, Ashanti shareholders received 0.29 ordinary shares of AngloGold for every Ashanti share.[4]
The new company sold its Union Reef Gold Mine in the Northern Territory of Australia in August 2004, followed by the sale of the Freda-Rebecca Gold Mine in Zimbabwe a month later.[4]
In late 2007, Mark Cutifani replaced Bobby Godsell as CEO of AngloGold Ashanti, being appointed a director of the company on 17 September 2007 and as CEO on 1 October that year.[5]
In January 2009, AngloGold Ashanti sold its 33% stake in the Boddington Gold Mine in Australia to Newmont Mining for US$1.0 billion.[6]
Russell Edey, chairman of AngloGold since 2002 and, after the merger also of AngloGold Ashanti, was replaced by Tito Mboweni in May 2010.[7] The company's Tau Lekoa Gold Mine in South Africa was sold to Buffelsfontein Gold Mines Limited in February 2009, with ownership being transferred on 1 August 2010.[8]
The company announced the elimination of the last of its hedge book in October 2010. The company had hedged 11.3 million ounces of gold, as of early 2008, under previous CEO Bobby Godsell. Under its new CEO, this was gradually reduced to 3.22 million. In October 2010, this remaining amount was paid off with US$2.63 billion, or US$1,300 per ounce of gold.[9]
AngloGold Ashanti is a signatory participant of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.
Criticism[edit]
In August 2008 British charity War on Want published a report accusing AngloGold Ashanti's parent company Anglo American of profiting from the abuse of people in the developing countries in which the company operates.[10] The report alleges abuses committed by AngloGold Ashanti subsidiaries in Colombia, Ghana and Mali. War on Want stated that AngloGold Ashanti was accused in 2008 in Colombia of "murders of trade union and community leaders who opposed the company's activities in the region". The company disclosed itself in 2006 or in 2008 for unacceptable safety performance in its platinum mines. Safety measures were taken.[11] Additionally, in 2005 the staff of the AGA exploration team in Ituri made an US$8,000 payment to the FNI, which had been accused of committing various humans rights abuses.[12]
In January 2011, AngloGold Ashanti was named the world's "Most Irresponsible Company" at the Public Eye Awards hosted with Greenpeace in Davos, Switzerland by the Erklärung von Bern, known in English as the Berne Convention. The nominating organisation, WACAM (Wassa Association of Communities Affected by Mining), said the company had a history of "gross human rights violations and environmental problems."[13]

4 The Tau Lekoa Gold Mine was sold to Buffelsfontein Gold Mines Limited, with ownership being transferred on 1 August 2010.

Fatalities[edit]
Fatalities in the South African gold mining industry, especially the underground mines, are common. As of 2009, 100 to 120 were reported every year. This did represent an improvement since 2007: AngloGold Ashanti has reduced the number of fatalities in its operations by 70%. One of the main reasons for this development was a program led by CEO Mark Cutifani aimed at reducing the company's number of fatalities to zero by 2015.[19] Of the 16 fatalities experienced by the company in 2009, 13 were in South Africa (2007: 27 of 34, 2008: 11 of 14).[1] Statistics company fatalities since 2004 founding:
