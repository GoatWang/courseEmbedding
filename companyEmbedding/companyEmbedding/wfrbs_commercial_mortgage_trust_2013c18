Item 2. Legal Proceedings                                                   

Legal proceeding from Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas                  

 "Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ("DBTCA") has been named as a defendant
in civil litigation concerning its role as trustee of certain residential   
mortgage backed securities ("RMBS") trusts. On June 18, 2014, a group of    
 investors filed a civil action against DBTCA and Deutsche Bank National Trust
Company ("DBNTC") in New York State Supreme Court purportedly on behalf of  
and for the benefit of 544 private-label RMBS trusts asserting claims for   
alleged violations of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, breach of       
contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence based on DBTCA's and      
DBNTC's alleged failure to perform their duties as trustees for the trusts. 
An amended complaint was filed on July 16, 2014, adding five plaintiffs and 
15 RMBS trusts to the action. DBTCA is reviewing these newly-filed          
pleadings."                                                                 

Legal proceeding from Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.                                

On June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint
 in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee under 276 residential mortgage 
backed securities ("RMBS") trusts. The complaint is one of six similar      
complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank,    
Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and US Bank) by certain of the      
institutional investor plaintiffs. The complaint against Wells Fargo Bank,  
N.A. alleges the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts causes of   
action based upon, among other things, the trustee's purported failure to   
enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for alleged breaches
of representations and warranties concerning loan quality, failure to notify
securityholders of purported events of default allegedly caused by breaches 
by mortgage loan servicers and purported failure to abide by appropriate    
standards of care following events of default. Relief sought includes money 
damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of certain expenses and     
equitable relief. Other cases alleging similar causes of action have        
previously been filed against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and other trustees by  
RMBS investors in other transactions.                                       

There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the      
 possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However,
  Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. denies liability and believes that it has performed its
  obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the
cause of losses to investors and that it has meritorious defenses, and it   
intends to contest the plaintiffs' claims vigorously.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Challenging Retail Environment Weights on REITsMixed economic news is weighing on retail markets, pushing REIT performance down in 2015. This week, the National Retail Federation announced that back-to-school spending is expected to be down 9.3% in 2015. This news came on the heels of a report from the Commerce Department stating that retail sales declined 0.3%... 
US REITs Feeling Effects from Turmoil in Greece and ChinaInternational economic forces have taken center stage this week, affecting both US stock markets and REITs. The crash in the Chinese stock market and ongoing concerns about the future of Greece in the eurozone drove markets down during the first half of the week. REITs fared better than the overall market...
What Does Increased Construction Mean for Apartment REITs?REITs so far this year have raised $17.1 billion of capital through the sale of unsecured notes, bringing the total raised over the past two and a half years to just more than $75 billion. That’s more than they raised during the previous five years. The massive volume shouldn’t be a surprise as it comes while the yield from 10-year Treasury bonds, the benchmark...

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are based on the stable performance of the underlying collateral pool. As of the September 2016 remittance, the pool has experienced 2.2% collateral reduction since issuance.There have been no delinquent or specially serviced loans since issuance. There are currently two loans on the servicer's watchlist, representing 2.4% of the current pool balance. Fitch modelled losses of 3.2% for the remaining pool, which is in line with Fitch's modelled loss at issuance. Since the last rating action, one loan has defeased.The largest loan in the pool is Garden State Plaza (14.8% of the pool). The subject is a 2.2 million square foot (sf) super regional mall in Paramus, NJ that is anchored by Macy's, Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus, Lord & Taylor and J.C. Penney. The mall was originally built in 1957 and most recently renovated in 2013 at a cost of $159 million. Other major tenants include a 16-screen AMC Loews, Forever 21, Best Buy and H&M. The loan is interest-only for the full term, and is pari-passu with a $150 million note securitized in the RBSCF 2013-GSP transaction. For the trailing 12-month (TTM) period ending March 31, 2016, in-line sales were reported at $647 per square foot (psf). This is a decline from the $787 psf reported at issuance, but is still considered strong. Mall sales are strong despite being open only six days a week, due to Bergen County Blue Laws prohibiting local retailers from being open on Sundays.The second largest loans loan is secured by a 1.3 million sf outlet mall located 15 miles southwest of New York City. Anchors include Burlington Coat Factory, Forever 21, Cohoes Fashions and a 22-screen Loews Theatres. The loan is interest-only for the full term, and is one of three pari-passu notes with a whole loan balance of $350 million. Glimcher was the original property owner before the company was acquired in 2014. The subject is now exclusively owned and operated by Simon Property Group and has been rebranded as The Mills at Jersey Gardens. Sales for the TTM period ending April 30, 2016 were reported to be $857 psf for in-line space. Gross sales have exceeded $500 million annually since 2010.The third largest loan, AmericasMart, is secured by a 7.1 million sf wholesale trade market with approximately 4.6 million sf of rentable area in four attached buildings. The property is located in the Atlanta CBD and was developed in phases, the first of which was completed in 1961. There are over 1,500 permanent tenants occupying 3.5 million sf, and 1.1 million sf of temporary exhibition space can be leased during trade shows. As of May 2016, the property was 99% leased. The trust note, which is one of four notes with a whole loan balance of $541 million, amortizes on a 25-year schedule.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe pool has been paid down by 2.2% since issuance, and loans representing 33.8% of the current balance are interest-only. Future deleveraging of the pool could result in upgrades, while material negative economic or asset level changes could result in downgrades; however, the pool's performance has been stable since issuance and Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration in the near term. The Rating Outlook for all classes remains Stable.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following classes as indicated:--$25.2 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;--$103.3 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;--$140 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;--$170 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;--$201 million class A-5 at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;--$63.7 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;--$70.1 million class A-S at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;--$773.3 million* class X-A at 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable;--$72.7 million class B at 'AA-sf', Outlook Stable;--$36.3 million class C at 'A-sf', Outlook Stable;--$0 class PEX at 'A-sf', Outlook Stable;Read More--$66.2 million class D at 'BBB-sf', Outlook Stable;--$19.5 million class E at 'BBsf', Outlook Stable;--$7.8 million class F at 'Bsf', Outlook Stable.*Notional amount and interest-only.The class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEX certificates, and vice versa.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
