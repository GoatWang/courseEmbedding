 Career History



Executive Consultant

                                    Current                


Odeon Capital Partners


                  Odeon Capital Partners (OCP) invests in private and select public growth and expansion stage companies in the enterprise software, outsourced business services and healthcare services sectors. They also invest to a lesser extent in select high growth manufacturing and distribution businesses. Within the enterprise software sector, the firm focuses on infrastructure software, supply chain management software and business application software.OCP seeks to invest in rapidly growing companies with strong fundamental characteristics including a proven operating history, solid financial metrics and a solid business franchise. Companies should have: (1) a competitive market position (2) broad-based customer acceptance of existing product lines (3) clear product positioning and differentiation (4) strong brand equity (5) a management team committed to growth (6) trailing annual revenues of $25 million to $100 million and (7) evidence of historical growth. Companies should also have reached profitability or be near profitable.In addition, OCP seeks to invest in opportunities that have one or more of the following characteristics constraining maximizing the value of the business: (1) companies that have never taken institutional money before but are now seeking growth capital (2) companies that have built an initial franchise but lack financial, managerial or other resources to maximize growth (3) quality businesses being spun out of larger corporations that have never received sufficient attention or resources (4) companies with positive operating results, but whose initial backers lack the funds to continue to support the business (5) high-quality business units that can be removed from a financially troubled parent and (6) publicly traded companies with market-cap significantly less than their intrinsic values.Investments range from $10 million to $15 million per company. The firm takes either control or significant minority positions and obtains board representation in each company in which they invest. OCP typically participates in three types of situations. They provide growth capital for business expansion, to grow existing product lines, to add new product lines and/or to expand sales and marketing efforts. They invest growth capital for companies in transition to achieve rapid growth. OCP also provides growth capital for financial restructurings, for companies with strong core products but high debt loads and for orphaned subsidiaries or divisions of a parent company.
