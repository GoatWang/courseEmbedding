other holder of Series E Pillar Warrants exercisable for shares of Common Stock exercised any such Series E Pillar Warrants; (C) shares of Common Stock issued upon Besancons exercise of its Series E Pillar Warrants, assuming that no other
holder of Series E Pillar Warrants exercisable for shares of Common Stock exercised any such Series E Pillar Warrants; (D) shares of Common Stock issued upon Pillar IIIs exercise of its Pillar III Offering Warrants, assuming that no other
holder of Pillar III Offering Warrants exercisable for shares of Common Stock exercised any such Pillar III Offering Warrants; and (E) shares of Common Stock issued upon Mr. El Zeins exercise of his vested options, assuming that no
other holder of options exercisable for shares of Common Stock exercises any such options. In addition, the terms of the Series D Pillar Warrants and the Series E Pillar Warrants (together, the Warrants), provide that the
Issuer shall not effect any exercise of Warrants, for a number of shares of Common Stock in excess of that number of shares of Common Stock which, upon giving effect to such exercise would cause (a) the aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock beneficially owned by Pillar and Pillar II and their affiliates to exceed 19.99% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Issuer as of the Closing Date, or (b) the combined voting power of the securities
of the Issuer beneficially owned by Pillar and Pillar II and their affiliates to exceed 19.99% of the combined voting power of all of the securities of the Issuer outstanding as of the Closing Date (collectively, the Conversion
Cap). In addition, the terms of the Preferred Stock provide that, for so long as the total number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Pillar and Pillar II and their affiliates exceeds 19.99% (subject to an increase to 25% upon
approval of the stockholders of the Issuer as described below) of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, in any election of directors and in any other vote to be taken by the stockholders of the Issuer, Pillar and Pillar II and their
affiliates will vote such number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by them in excess of 19.99% (subject to an increase to 25% upon approval of the stockholders of the Issuer as described below) in the same manner as, and in the same
proportion to, the votes cast by the other holders of the Issuers Common Stock or other voting securities (the Voting Cap). Accordingly, the 29,253,114 shares of Common Stock reported above represent 19.99% of the
146,338,744 shares of Common Stock outstanding as of the consummation of the October 7 Offering (the Closing Date).

Limitations on Conversion and Exercise 
The terms of the Series D Preferred Stock and the Series D Warrants provide that the Issuer shall not effect (i) any conversion of Series D Preferred
Stock or (ii) any exercise of Series D Warrants, for a number of shares of Common Stock in excess of that number of shares of Common Stock which, upon giving effect to such conversion or exercise, as the case may be, would cause (A) the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Pillar and its affiliates to exceed 19.99% of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Issuer as of the Series D Closing Date, or (B) the combined
voting power of the securities of the Issuer beneficially owned by Pillar and its affiliates to exceed 19.99% of the combined voting power of all of the securities of the Issuer outstanding as of the Series D Closing Date. As described below, the
limitation on the exercise of the Series D Warrants was amended pursuant to the Warrant Amendment. As of the date of this filing, the Series D Preferred Stock has been converted to Common Stock of the Issuer. 
Standstill  The Series D Purchase Agreement provides
that, for so long as the total number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Pillar and its affiliates exceeds 15% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, neither Pillar nor its affiliates will, directly or indirectly (unless
specifically invited in writing by the Issuer to do so):  (a) effect or seek, initiate, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) or participate in,
any acquisition of any securities (or beneficial ownership thereof) or assets of the Issuer; any tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the Issuer; any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation,
dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect to the Issuer; or any solicitation of proxies or consents to vote any voting securities of the Issuer; provided, that this clause (a) shall not restrict the
ability of any director of the Issuer that is affiliated with Pillar to (i) acquire, exercise or dispose of any stock options or other equity securities of the Issuer received as compensation for serving as a director or (ii) perform his
or her duties as a director of the Issuer;   


(b)
form, join or in any way participate in a group with respect to any securities of the Issuer;  (c)
otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) or policies of the Issuer; 
(d) take any action which could reasonably be expected to force the Issuer to make a public announcement regarding any of the types of matters set forth in
clause (a), (b) or (c) above; or   


(e)
enter into any agreements, discussions or arrangements with any third party with respect to any of the foregoing. 
This standstill provision shall not restrict Pillars ability to exercise its preemptive rights as more fully described below under the heading
Preemptive Rights.  Voting  On any matter
presented to the stockholders of the Issuer for their action or consideration at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, each holder of outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the
number of whole shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series D Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible as of the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter. 
The Series D Purchase Agreement provides that, for so long as the total number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Pillar and its affiliates
exceeds 15% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, in any election of directors and in any other vote to be taken by the stockholders of the Issuer (whether taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or by written action), Pillar
and its affiliates will vote such number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Pillar and its affiliates in excess of 15% in the same manner as, and in the same proportion to, the votes cast by the other holders of the Companys
Common Stock or other voting securities. As described below, this voting limitation was amended pursuant to the Purchase Agreement Amendment. 
Preemptive Rights  The Series D Purchase Agreement
provides that, in the event the Issuer on or prior to the earlier of (i) November 4, 2014 and (ii) the day that Pillar holds a number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock (including shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion of
the Series D Preferred Stock) which is less than 50% of the number of shares of Series D Preferred Stock purchased by Pillar, proposes to:

(a) privately sell and issue securities of the Issuer, Pillar shall have the option to purchase, on the same
terms and conditions offered by the Issuer to the other purchasers of such securities in such additional financing, up to that percentage of the securities sold in such additional financing equal to (A) the number of shares then held by Pillar
as compared to (B) the total number of shares then outstanding, which pro rata amount shall not exceed 19.99% of such additional financing or  (b)
enter into a loan financing for the purpose of raising capital and not for the purpose of purchasing equipment, or privately sell and issue convertible debt securities or preferred stock of the Issuer that ranks senior to the Preferred Stock, Pillar
shall have the option to participate in such loan financing or other senior financings, on the same terms and conditions offered by the Issuer to the other participants or purchasers of securities in such senior financings, up to that percentage of
the amount of the loan financing or of the securities sold in such senior financing equal to the product of:  (I) A fraction, the numerator of which equals
the number of shares then held by Pillar and the denominator of which equals the total number of shares issued to Pillar; and  (II) If the closing date of
the senior financing is on or prior to (i) November 4, 2012, 50%, (ii) November 4, 2013, 40%, or (iii) November 4, 2014, 30%. 
Registration Rights Agreement  In connection with the
Series D Purchase Agreement, Pillar entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated November 4, 2011 (the Series D Registration Rights Agreement), with the Issuer. The Series D Registration Rights Agreement provides
that the Company will file a resale registration statement (the Series D Resale Registration Statement) covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock and exercise of the Series D
Warrants. The Issuer agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective the Series D Resale Registration Statement on or prior to February 2, 2012. 
If (i) the Series D Resale Registration Statement is not declared effective on or before March 4, 2012 or (ii) after the Series D Resale
Registration Statement has been declared effective, sales of any of the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Series D Registration Rights Agreement) cannot be made pursuant to such Series D Resale Registration Statement because such Series D
Resale Registration Statement has been suspended (except as a result of a permitted suspension as provided in the Series D Registration Rights Agreement), then the Issuer shall pay to Pillar an amount equal to the product of (A) the aggregate
purchase price of the Series D Preferred Stock then held by Pillar, multiplied by (B) one hundredths (.01), for each thirty (30) day period thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Issuer be obligated to make
payments to Pillar in an aggregate amount that exceeds 10% of the aggregate purchase price paid by Pillar for the Series D Preferred Stock.  The Issuer
will pay all registration expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, related to the Issuers performance of the Series D Registration Rights Agreement. The Series D Registration Rights Agreement contains customary
cross-indemnification provisions.  The foregoing descriptions of the Series D Purchase Agreement and the Series D Registration Rights Agreement and of the
terms the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of the Series D Preferred Stock and the Form of Series D Warrant issued to Pillar (collectively, the Series D Transaction Documents), do not purport to be complete and
are qualified in their entirety by the terms of each such document, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 2, Exhibit 3, Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

Series E Financing 
Convertible Preferred Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement 
On November 9, 2012, Pillar II, Participations Besancon and the Issuer entered into a Convertible Preferred Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the
Series E Purchase Agreement) pursuant to which (i) Pillar II acquired from the Issuer (a) 313,341 shares of Series E Preferred Stock (convertible into 6,266,820 shares of Common Stock) and (b) Series E Warrants to
purchase 6,266,820 shares of Common Stock, and (ii) Participations Besancon acquired from the Issuer (a) 110,901 shares of Series E Preferred Stock (convertible into 2,218,020 shares of Common Stock) and (b) Series E Warrants to
purchase 2,218,020 shares of Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $6,999,993. The transaction closed on November 9, 2012 (the November Closing Date). In connection with the closing of the transaction, Abdul-Wahab
Umari, a managing partner of Pillar GP, was elected to the Board upon the recommendation of its Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee effective immediately following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Series E Purchase
Agreement. The source of funds for the purchase by Pillar II was the working capital of Pillar II and the source of funds for the purchase by Besancon was the working capital of Besancon. As of the date of this filing, the Series E Preferred Stock
has been converted to Common Stock of the Issuer.  Limitations on Transfer 
The Series E Purchase Agreement provides restrictions on the transfer of any securities issued to Pillar II and Besancon (including securities convertible into
or exercisable for Common Stock) pursuant to the Series E Purchase Agreement, including to not sell or transfer any such securities in one or a series of transactions if such transfer would, in the aggregate, result in the transfer more than 5% of
the then outstanding combined voting power of the outstanding securities of the Company (excluding from this restriction certain transfers to permitted transferees or in connection with an underwritten public offering by the Company that has been
approved by the Board).  Limitations on Conversion and Exercise 
The terms of the Series E Preferred Stock and the Series E Warrants provide that the Issuer shall not effect (i) any conversion of Series E Preferred
Stock or (ii) any exercise of Series E Warrants, for a number of shares of Common Stock in excess of that number of shares of Common Stock which, upon giving effect to such conversion or exercise, as the case may be, would cause (A) the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Pillar II, Besancon and/or its affiliates to exceed 19.99% (subject to an increase to 35% upon the approval by the stockholders of the Company of the issuance and sale by the Company
to Pillar II and Besancon (together with all prior issuances and sales to Pillar) of a number of Shares of Common Stock (including securities convertible into or exercisable for Common Stock) that is greater than 19.99% of the outstanding Common
Stock or outstanding voting power of the Company after such issuance and sale in accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5636(b) (the Nasdaq Proposal)) of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Issuer as of
the November Closing Date, or (B) the combined voting power of the securities of the Issuer beneficially owned by Pillar II, Besancon and/or its affiliates to exceed 19.99% (subject to an increase to 35% upon stockholder approval of the Nasdaq
Proposal) of the combined voting power of all of the securities of the Issuer outstanding as of the November Closing Date.  Standstill 
The Series E Purchase Agreement provides that, for so long as the total number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Pillar II, Besancon and/or its
affiliates exceeds 15% of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, neither Pillar II, Besancon nor their respective affiliates will, directly or indirectly (unless specifically invited in writing by the Issuer to do so): 
(a) effect or seek, initiate, offer or propose (whether publicly or otherwise) or participate in, any acquisition of any securities (or beneficial ownership
thereof) or assets of the Issuer; any tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination involving the Issuer; any recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation, dissolution or other extraordinary transaction with respect
to the Issuer; or any solicitation of proxies or consents to vote any voting securities of the Issuer; provided, that this clause (a) shall not restrict the ability of any director of the Issuer that is affiliated with
Pillar II or Besancon to (i) acquire, exercise or dispose of any stock options or other equity securities of the Issuer received as compensation for serving as a director or (ii) perform his or her duties as a director of the Issuer; 
(b) form, join or in any way participate in a group with respect to any securities of the Issuer; 
(c) otherwise act, alone or in concert with others, to seek to control or influence the management, Board or policies of the Issuer; 
(d) nominate or otherwise support the election of any person as a director of the Company except as approved by the Board, subject to certain exceptions;

(f) enter into any agreements, discussions or arrangements with any third party with respect to any of the
foregoing.  This standstill provision shall not restrict Pillar IIs or Besancons ability to exercise its preemptive rights as more fully
described below under the heading Preemptive Rights.  Voting; Protective Provisions 
For so long as at least 84,849 shares of Series E Preferred Stock (subject to adjustment) remain outstanding, the Company has agreed that it will not, directly
or indirectly, (a) amend the Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws of the Company in a manner that adversely and uniquely affects the Series E Preferred Stock, (b) except as expressly permitted by the Certificate of Designations for the
Series E Preferred Stock, purchase or redeem or pay or declare any dividend or make any distribution on, any shares of capital stock of the Company, or (c) recapitalize or reclassify any of the Common Stock, without in each case the written
consent or affirmative vote of the holders of at least 51% of the then outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock (in addition to any other vote required by law or the Certificate of Incorporation). 
Unless and until the stockholders of the Company approve the Nasdaq Proposal, the Series E Preferred Stock will have no voting rights. Subject to and
effective upon the date that the stockholders of the Company approve the Nasdaq Proposal, each holder of outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock will be entitled to cast a number of votes equal to the lesser of (a) the number of whole
shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible and (b) the product of the Voting Adjustment Percentage (as defined in the Certificate of Designations for the Series E Preferred
Stock) multiplied by the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible. The intent of the Voting Adjustment Percentage is to provide that the maximum aggregate voting
power that the holders of Series E Preferred Stock and their affiliates may hold does not exceed 35% of the total outstanding voting power of the Company at any time. The Voting Adjustment Percentage does not modify the provisions set forth in the
Series E Purchase Agreement that require the Pillar II, Besancon and their affiliates to vote any shares held by them in excess of the number of shares equal to 19.99% or 25%, as applicable, of the outstanding Common Stock (including shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of securities that are convertible into or exercisable for shares of Common Stock held by them and their affiliates) in the same manner and percentage as the holders of the Common Stock (other than
Pillar II, Besancon and their affiliates) vote on such matter as more fully described below.  The Series E Purchase Agreement provides that, for so long
as the total number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Pillar II, Besancon and/or its affiliates exceeds 19.99% (subject to an increase to 25% upon stockholder approval of Nasdaq Proposal) of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock,
in any election of directors and in any other vote to be taken by the stockholders of the Issuer (whether taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or by written action), Pillar II, Besancon and/or its affiliates will vote such number of
shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Pillar II, Besancon and/or its affiliates in excess of 19.99% (subject to an increase to 25% upon stockholder approval of Nasdaq Proposal) in the same manner as, and in the same proportion to, the votes
cast by the other holders of the Companys Common Stock or other voting securities.  Each of Pillar II and Besancon agreed to refrain from exercising
any dissenters rights or rights of appraisal under applicable law at any time with respect to any sale of the Company to the extent such sale has been approved by the Board. 
Preemptive Rights  The Series E Purchase Agreement
provides that, in the event the Issuer on or prior to the earlier of (i) November 9, 2015 and (ii) the day that Pillar II or Besancon, respectively, holds a number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock (including shares of Common
Stock issued upon conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock) which is less than 50% of the number of shares of Series E Preferred Stock purchased by Pillar II or Besancon, respectively, proposes to: 
(a) privately sell and issue securities of the Issuer, Pillar II and Besancon, respectively, shall have the option to purchase, on the same terms and
conditions offered by the Issuer to the other purchasers of such securities in such additional financing, up to that percentage of the securities sold in such additional financing equal to (A) the number of shares then held by each of Pillar II
and Besancon, respectively, as compared to (B) the total number of shares then outstanding, which pro rata amount shall not exceed 19.99% (subject to an increase to 35% upon stockholder approval of Nasdaq Proposal) of such additional financing
or  (b) enter into a loan financing for the purpose of raising capital and not for the purpose of purchasing equipment, or privately sell and issue
convertible debt securities or preferred stock of the Issuer that ranks senior to the Series E Preferred Stock, each of Pillar II and Besancon, respectively, shall have the option to participate in such loan financing or other senior financings, on
the same terms and conditions offered by the Issuer to the other participants or purchasers of securities in such senior financings, up to that percentage of the amount of the loan financing or of the securities sold in such senior financing equal
to the product of:  (I) A fraction, the numerator of which equals the number of shares then held by each of Pillar II and Besancon, respectively, and the
denominator of which equals the total number of shares issued to each of Pillar II and Besancon, respectively; and

(II) If the closing date of the senior financing is on or prior to (i) November 9, 2013, 50%,
(ii) November 9, 2014, 40%, or (iii) November 9, 2015, 30%.  Automatic Adjustments to Series D Preferred Stock and Series D
Warrants  As a result of the transactions contemplated by the Series E Purchase Agreement, the conversion price of the Series D Preferred Stock
automatically adjusted downward to $1.46 and the exercise price of the Series D Warrants automatically adjusted downward to $1.46.  Registration Rights
Agreement  In connection with the Series E Purchase Agreement, Pillar II and Besancon entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated
November 9, 2012 (the Series E Registration Rights Agreement), with the Issuer. The Series E Registration Rights Agreement provides that the Company will file a resale registration statement (the Series E Resale
Registration Statement) covering the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock and exercise of the Series E Warrants. The Issuer agreed to use its reasonable best efforts to cause to become effective
the Series E Resale Registration Statement on or prior to February 7, 2013.  If (i) the Series E Resale Registration Statement is not declared
effective on or before March 30, 2013 or (ii) after the Series E Resale Registration Statement has been declared effective, sales of any of the Registrable Securities (as defined in the Series E Registration Rights Agreement) cannot be
made pursuant to such Series E Resale Registration Statement because such Series E Resale Registration Statement has been suspended (except as a result of a permitted suspension as provided in the Series E Registration Rights Agreement), then the
Issuer shall pay to Pillar II and Besancon an amount equal to the product of (A) the aggregate purchase price of the Series E Preferred Stock then held by Pillar II and Besancon, multiplied by (B) one hundredths (.01), for each thirty
(30) day period thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Issuer be obligated to make payments to Pillar II and Besancon in an aggregate amount that exceeds 10% of the aggregate purchase price paid by Pillar II and
Besancon for the Series E Preferred Stock.  The Issuer will pay all registration expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, related to
the Issuers performance of the Series E Registration Rights Agreement. The Series E Registration Rights Agreement contains customary cross-indemnification provisions. 
Amendment No. 1 to Series D Convertible Preferred Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement 
In connection with the Series E Purchase Agreement, Pillar entered into Amendment No. 1 to Convertible Preferred Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement,
dated November 9, 2012 (the Purchase Agreement Amendment), with the Issuer. The Purchase Agreement Amendment provides that, for so long as the total number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Pillar or its
affiliates exceeds 19.99% (subject to an increase to 25% upon stockholder approval of the Nasdaq Proposal) of the then outstanding shares of Common Stock, in any election of directors and in any other vote to be taken by the stockholders of the
Issuer (whether taken at an annual or special meeting of stockholders or by written action), Pillar or its affiliates will vote such number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by Pillar or its affiliates in excess of 19.99% (subject to an
increase to 25% upon stockholder approval of the Nasdaq Proposal) in the same manner as, and in the same proportion to, the votes cast by the other holders of the Companys Common Stock or other voting securities. Pillar agreed to refrain from
exercising any dissenters rights or rights of appraisal under applicable law at any time with respect to any sale of the Company to the extent such sale has been approved by the Board. 
The Purchase Agreement Amendment also provides for certain restrictions on the transfer of any securities issued to Pillar (including securities convertible
into or exercisable for Common Stock) pursuant to the Series D Purchase Agreement, including to not sell or transfer any such securities in one or a series of transactions if such transfer would, in the aggregate, result in the transfer more than 5%
of the then outstanding combined voting power of the outstanding securities of the Company (excluding from this restriction certain transfers to permitted transferees or in connection with an underwritten public offering by the Company that has been
approved by the Board).  Amendment No. 1 to Common Stock Purchase Warrant 
In connection with the Series E Purchase Agreement, Pillar entered into Amendment No. 1 to Common Stock Purchase Warrant, dated November 9, 2012 (the
Warrant Amendment), with the Issuer. The Warrant Amendment provides that the exercise limitation set forth therein shall be amended to increase the 19.99% limitation on exercise to 35% upon the Companys receipt of
stockholder approval of the Nasdaq Proposal.  The foregoing descriptions of the Series E Purchase Agreement and the Series E Registration Rights Agreement
and of the terms the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of the Series E Preferred Stock and the Form of Series E Warrant issued to Pillar and Besancon, the Purchase Agreement Amendment and the Warrant Amendment (collectively, the
Series E Transaction Documents), do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the terms of each such document, which are attached hereto as Exhibit 6, Exhibit 7, Exhibit 8, Exhibit 9, Exhibit 10 and Exhibit
11, respectively, and are incorporated herein by reference.

rights, powers, preferences and other terms of the Series D Preferred Stock under Section 6 of the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series D Preferred Stock (the Series D Certificate of Designations), including
without limitation the right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any portion of the shares of the Issuers Series D Preferred Stock at a price equal to the original Series D Preferred Stock purchase price per share plus all accrued or
declared but unpaid dividends thereon upon the occurrence of specified fundamental changes such as mergers, consolidations, business combinations, stock purchases or similar transactions resulting in a person or group unaffiliated with any holder of
the Series D Preferred Stock owning 66.67% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the Issuer or successor entity.  Under the agreement, the
Issuer and Pillar I and Pillar II agreed, among other things:   


 

 
to an amendment to the Series D Certificate of Designations for the Series D Preferred Stock that would cause:   


 

 
the dividend provisions of the Series D Certificate of Designations to change the date after which the Issuer may elect to pay dividends in shares of its common stock from December 31, 2014 to October 1, 2013,
and to allow for the payment of such dividends in shares of a to-be-created new series of non-voting preferred stock in the event that payment of such dividends may not be made in shares of its common stock; and 
 


 

 
in connection with the waiver of the right to require the Issuer to purchase the Series D Preferred Stock upon the occurrence of specified fundamental changes, to modify the Series D Certificate of Designations to
provide, in the event of a sale of the Issuer, for the distribution of any assets that remain available for distribution to the Issuers stockholders, after payment to the holders of the Issuers Series A Convertible Preferred Stock and
any other class of the Issuers capital stock that ranks senior to the Series D Preferred Stock, to the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock on a pro rata basis with the holders of the Issuers common stock, Series E Preferred Stock and
such new series of non-voting preferred stock; and   


 

 
to an amendment to the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of Series E Preferred Stock (the Series E Certificate of Designations), that: 
 


 

 
modified the dividend provisions of the Series E Certificate of Designations to allow for the payment of dividends in shares of the Issuers common stock commencing October 1, 2013; and 
 


 

 
allowed for the payment of dividends in shares of a to-be-created new series of non-voting preferred stock in the event that payment of such dividends may not be made in shares of the Issuers common stock as a
result of the application of the beneficial ownership and voting power limitations set forth in the Series E Certificate of Designations. 
In addition, the Issuer agreed to seek approval from its stockholders at the 2013 annual meeting of stockholders of amendments to the Series D Certificate of
Designations and Series E Certificate of Designations to effect these changes to the dividend provisions of the Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock, the redemption rights of the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock and the
rights of the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock to distributions in the event of a sale of the Issuer. Each of Pillar I and Pillar II agreed:   


 

 
to vote, and to cause its affiliates to vote, all shares of the Issuers voting stock held by Pillar I, Pillar II and their affiliates, and over which they have the power to vote, in favor of such amendments; and
  


 

 
not to, and to cause their affiliates not to, sell or transfer any shares of common stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock held by them to any person, entity or group unless such proposed transferee
agrees in a written instrument executed by such transferee, the applicable entity and the Issuer to take and hold such securities subject to, among other things, the agreement and to be bound by the terms of the agreement, including the waiver of
rights, voting agreements and restrictions on transfer set forth therein.

D Preferred Stock equal to the original issue price of such share of Series D Preferred Stock plus any dividends accrued or declared but unpaid thereon to the extent such amount is greater than the amount that would have been payable with respect to
such share had all shares of Series D Preferred Stock been converted into shares of the Issuers Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidation, and that upon a Liquidation the holders of the Series D Preferred Stock will receive an amount
per share of Series D Preferred Stock equal to the amount that would be payable with respect to such share had all shares of Series D Preferred Stock been converted into shares of the Issuers Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidation.
 In addition, under the agreement, Pillar II and Besancon, together the holders of 100% of the Issuers Series E Preferred Stock, irrevocably agreed

issue price of such share of Series E Preferred Stock plus any dividends accrued or declared but unpaid thereon to the extent such amount is greater than the amount that would have been payable with respect to such share had all shares of Series E
Preferred Stock been converted into shares of the Issuers Common Stock immediately prior to such Liquidation, and that upon a Liquidation the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock will receive under Section 2.1 of the Series E
Certificate of Designations an amount per share of Series E Preferred Stock equal to the amount that would be payable with respect to such share had all shares of Series E Preferred Stock been converted into shares of the Issuers Common Stock
immediately prior to such Liquidation.  Under the agreement, the Issuer agreed to seek approval from its stockholders at its 2013 annual meeting of
stockholders of amendments to the Series D Certificate of Designations and Series E Certificate of Designations to effect these changes to the liquidation provisions of the Series D Preferred Stock and Series E Preferred Stock, and each of Pillar I,

not to, and to cause their affiliates not to, sell or transfer any shares of Common Stock, Series D Preferred Stock or Series E Preferred Stock held by them to any person, entity or group unless such proposed transferee
agrees in a written instrument executed by such transferee, the applicable entity and the Issuer to take and hold such securities subject to, among other things, the agreement and to be bound by the terms of the agreement, including the waiver of
rights, voting agreements and restrictions on transfer set forth therein.  The agreement became effective upon the consummation of the
May 7 Offering on May 7, 2013.  April 30 Amendment Warrants

Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!
