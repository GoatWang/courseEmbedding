Sterling Corporate Tax Credit Fund XXV, L.P. v Youngblood Senior Hous.
Assoc., LLC (2014 NY Slip Op 02029)





Sterling Corporate Tax Credit Fund XXV, L.P. v Youngblood
Senior Hous. Assoc., LLC


2014 NY Slip Op 02029 [115 AD3d 932]


March 26, 2014


Appellate Division, Second Department


Published by New York State Law Reporting
Bureau pursuant to Judiciary Law § 431.

As corrected through Wednesday, April 30, 2014


Sterling Corporate Tax Credit Fund XXV, L.P., et al.,
Plaintiffs,vYoungblood Senior Housing Associates, LLC, et al., Respondents.
Benowich Law, LLP, Nonparty Appellant.
—[*1]
Benowich Law, LLP, White Plains, N.Y. (Leonard Benowich of counsel),
nonparty appellant pro se.
Feerick Lynch MacCartney, PLLC, South Nyack, N.Y. (Dennis E. A. Lynch of
counsel), for respondents.
In an action, inter alia, to remove the defendants as partners in the plaintiff Sterling
Corporate 
Tax Credit Fund XXV, L.P., nonparty Benowich Law, LLP, appeals from an order of the
Supreme Court, Nassau County (Bucaria, J.), entered May 31, 2013, which granted the
defendants' motion, in effect, to compel it to surrender its litigation file in this action. By
decision and order on motion dated July 23, 2013, this Court granted the motion of the
nonparty Benowich Law, LLP, to stay enforcement of the order entered May 31, 2013,
pending hearing and determination of the appeal.
Ordered that the order is reversed, on the law, with costs, and the defendants' motion
is denied.
"Under New York law a client may discharge an attorney at any time, with or without
cause" (Lai Ling Cheng v Modansky Leasing Co., 73 NY2d 454, 457 [1989];
see Campagnola v Mulholland, Minion & Roe, 76 NY2d 38, 43 [1990]). If a
client discharges an attorney without cause, the attorney possesses a common-law
retaining lien on the client's file in his or her possession and is entitled to recover
compensation from the client measured by the fair and reasonable value of the services
rendered, regardless of whether that amount is more or less than the amount provided in
the contract or retainer agreement (see Lai Ling Cheng v Modansky Leasing Co.,
73 NY2d at 457-458; see also
Mosiello v Velenzuela, 84 AD3d 1188, 1189 [2011]).
In support of their motion, in effect, to compel the nonparty Benowich Law, LLP
(hereinafter the law firm), to surrender its litigation file in this action, the defendants
acknowledged that the law firm had asserted that the defendants owed it legal fees.
Further, the defendants failed to allege that the law firm was discharged for cause.
"Absent evidence of discharge for cause, a court should not order turnover of an
outgoing attorney's file before the client fully pays the attorney's disbursements or
provides security therefor" (Warsop v Novik, 50 AD3d 608, 609 [2008]; see [*2]Law Firm of Ravi Batra, P.C. v Rabinowich, 77 AD3d
532 [2010]; Zito v
Fischbein Badillo Wagner Harding, 58 AD3d 532, 533 [2009]; Gonzalez v City of New York,
45 AD3d 347, 348 [2007]).
The defendants' remaining contentions are either without merit or not properly before
this Court.
Therefore, the Supreme Court erred in directing the law firm to surrender the
litigation file to the defendants (see Law Firm of Ravi Batra, P.C. v Rabinowich,
77 AD3d at 533; Zito v Fischbein Badillo Wagner Harding, 58 AD3d at 533;
Warsop v Novik, 50 AD3d at 609). Skelos, J.P., Dickerson, Leventhal and Hall,
JJ., concur.

 The Lead
Sterling Equity Opportunities: The Lead, "What do you do and why is it different?"

Equity Opportunities Group portfolios seek to give clients the “chance to outperform” an index with below average risk.

This quarter’s Financial Analysts Journal highlights how similar high Active Share and lower turnover portfolios outperform over time.
