1Represents the institutional offering price of FSIC III’s common stock. The institutional offering price is subject to offering expenses of up to 1.5%. Expenses and fees are described more fully in FSIC III’s prospectus. Please consult the prospectus and read it carefully. In February 2016, FSIC III closed its public offering to investors who purchase shares of its common stock through the independent broker-dealer channel.
        

2The annualized distribution rate shown is expressed as a percentage equal to the projected annualized distribution amount per share (which is calculated by annualizing the regular weekly cash distribution per share as of the date indicated, without compounding), divided by FSIC III’s institutional offering price per share as of the date indicated. The annualized distribution rate shown may be rounded. The payment of future distributions on FSIC III’s shares of common stock is subject to the discretion of FSIC III’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, 100% of FSIC III’s distributions were funded through net investment income on a tax basis. No portion of FSIC III’s distributions for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was funded through expense reimbursements from FSIC III’s sponsor. The determination of the tax attributes of FSIC III’s distributions is made annually at the end of FSIC III’s fiscal year, and a determination made on an interim basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of FSIC III’s distributions for a full year. The actual tax characteristics of distributions to stockholders are reported to stockholders annually on Form 1099-DIV. FSIC III’s total operating expenses and excise taxes as a percentage of average net assets was 7.51% for the year ended December 31, 2016.

Institutional Stockholder Returns are the total returns an investor received for the highlighted period taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSIC III's institutional offering price at the beginning of the applicable period and reinvested all cash distributions pursuant to FSIC III's distribution reinvestment plan ("DRP"). Valuation as of the end of each period is the redemption price pursuant to FSIC III’s share repurchase program on such date. Upon liquidation or redemption, market conditions may cause the actual values to be more or less than the values shown.
Although FSIC III closed its offering to new investors investing through independent broker-dealers in February 2016, it continues to offer shares to new investors through the institutional channel at the institutional offering price. FSIC III’s shares are no longer subject to a sales load, but are still subject to offering expenses of up to 1.5% of the gross proceeds received in its offering. FSIC III’s ratio of total operating expenses to average net assets was 7.51% for the year ended December 31, 2016.


2Cumulative cash distributions per share reflect the total regular cash distributions paid since inception on a per share basis as of June 30, 2017. The payment of future distributions on FSIC III’s shares is subject to the sole discretion of FSIC III’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions.

Investing in FSIC III may be considered speculative and involves a high level of risk, including the risk of a substantial loss of investment. The following are some of the risks an investment in FSIC III’s common stock involves; however, you should carefully consider all of the information found in the section of FSIC III’s prospectus entitled “Risk Factors” before deciding to invest in shares of FSIC III’s common stock.Because there is no public trading market for shares of FSIC III’s common stock and FSIC III is not obligated to effectuate a liquidity event by a specified date, if at all, it is unlikely that you will be able to sell your shares. If you are able to sell your shares before FSIC III completes a liquidity event, it is likely that you will receive less than you paid for them. While FSIC III intends to conduct quarterly tender offers for its shares, only a limited number of shares will be eligible for repurchase and FSIC III may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time. In addition, any such repurchases will be at the current institutional offering price on the date of repurchase. FSIC III intends to invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as “junk,” have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. They may also be difficult to value and illiquid. FSIC III’s distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available toFSIC III for investment. Any capital returned to stockholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses. An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including lack of available information about these companies.Investing in middle market companies involves a number of significant risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on FSIC III’s operating results.A lack of liquidity in certain of FSIC III’s investments may adversely affect its business.FSIC III is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, which may have a substantial negative impact on its investments.FSIC III has borrowed funds to make investments, which increases the volatility of its investments and may increase the risks of investing in its securities.FSIC III has limited operating history and is subject to the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business.If FSIC III is unable to raise substantial funds in its ongoing, continuous “best efforts” public offering, then FSIC III will be more limited in the number and type of investments it may make.FSIC III is a long-term investment for persons of adequate financial means who have no need for liquidity in their investment. To invest in FSIC III, an investor must have either (i) a net worth of at least $70,000 and an annual gross income of at least $70,000, or (ii) a net worth of at least $250,000. Some states impose higher suitability standards. Please consult the prospectus for a detailed description of the suitability standards imposed on investors, including heightened standards required by certain states. FSIC III’s previous distributions to stockholders were funded in significant part from the reimbursement of certain expenses, including through the waiver of certain investment advisoryfees that are subject to repayment to its affiliate, FS Investments, and FSIC III’s future distributions may be funded from such waivers and reimbursements. Significant portions of thesedistributions may not be based on FSIC III’s investment performance, and such waivers and reimbursements by FS Investments may not continue in the future. If FS Investments were notto reimburse certain of FSIC III’s expenses, including through the waiver of certain of its advisory fees, significant portions of these distributions may come from offering proceeds orborrowings. The repayment of any amount owed to FS Investments will reduce the future distributions to which you would otherwise be entitled. 







To invest in FSIC III, an investor must have either (i) a net worth of at least $70,000 and an annual gross income of at least $70,000, or (ii) a net worth of at least $250,000. Some states impose higher suitability standards. Please consult the prospectus for a detailed description of the suitability standards imposed on investors, including heightened standards required by certain states. An investment in FSIC III’s common stock involves significant costs and investors should review the information in FSIC III’s prospectus regarding fees and expenses. Corporate governanceFS Investment Solutions, LLC | 201 Rouse Boulevard | Philadelphia, PA 19112877-372-9880 | Member FINRA/SIPC

1Stockholder returns (without sales charge) are the total returns an investor received for the highlighted period taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at the public offering price for FSIC IV’s shares of Class T common stock, excluding any selling commissions, at the beginning of the applicable period and reinvested all distributions pursuant to FSIC IV’s distribution reinvestment plan (DRP). Valuation as of the end of each period is the repurchase price pursuant to FSIC IV’s share repurchase program on such date. Stockholder returns (without sales charge) are net of a 1.00% annual distribution fee and do not include selling commissions, which, effective as of January 25, 2017, could total up to 4.25% of the public offering price per share of Class T common stock. Had such selling commissions been included, the performance shown would be lower.
              

2The stockholder return (with sales charge) is the total return an investor received since inception taking into account all distributions paid during such period, compounded monthly. The calculation assumes that the investor purchased shares at FSIC IV’s public offering price per share of Class T common stock, including the then applicable maximum selling commissions (up to 2.20%), at inception and reinvested all distributions pursuant to FSIC IV’s DRP. Valuation as of the end of the period assumes such investor tendered all shares of Class T common stock pursuant to FSIC IV’s share repurchase program at the repurchase price on such date.
              

3Cumulative cash distributions per share reflect the total regular cash distributions paid since inception on a per share basis as of June 30, 2017, and are net of the 1.00% annual distribution fee. The payment of future distributions on FSIC IV’s shares of Class T common stock is subject to the discretion of FSIC IV’s board of directors and applicable legal restrictions and, therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of any such future distributions

If you are able to sell your shares before FSIC IV completes a liquidity event, it is likely that you will receive less than you paid for them. While FSIC IV intends to conduct quarterly tender offers for FSIC IV’s shares, only a limited number of shares will be eligible for repurchase and FSIC IV may amend, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time. In addition, any such repurchases will be at a discount to the current offering price on the date of repurchase.FSIC IV intends to invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as “junk,” have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. They may also be difficult to value and illiquid.FSIC IV’s distributions may be funded from unlimited amounts of offering proceeds or borrowings, which may constitute a return of capital and reduce the amount of capital available to FSIC IV for investment. Any capital returned to stockholders through distributions will be distributed after payment of fees and expenses.An investment strategy focused primarily on privately held companies presents certain challenges, including lack of available information about these companies.Investing in middle market companies involves a number of significant risks, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on FSIC IV’s operating results.A lack of liquidity in certain of FSIC IV’s investments may adversely affect FSIC IV’s business.FSIC IV is subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, which may have a substantial negative impact on FSIC IV’s investments.FSIC IV has borrowed funds to make investments, which increases the volatility of FSIC IV’s investments and may increase the risks of investing in FSIC IV’s securities.FSIC IV has limited operating history and is subject to the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new business.If FSIC IV is unable to raise substantial funds in its ongoing, continuous “best efforts” public offering, then FSIC IV will be more limited in the number and type of investments it may make.FSIC IV’s previous distributions to stockholders were funded in significant part from the reimbursement of certain expenses, including through the waiver of certain investment advisory fees that are subject to repayment to FSIC IV’s affiliate, FS Investments, and FSIC IV’s future distributions may be funded from such waivers and reimbursements. Significant portions of these distributions may not be based on FSIC IV’s investment performance, and such waivers and reimbursements by FS Investments may not continue in the future. If FS Investments were not to reimburse certain of FSIC IV’s expenses, including through the waiver of certain of its advisory fees, significant portions of these distributions may come from offering proceeds or borrowings. The repayment of any amount owed to FS Investments will reduce the future distributions to which you would otherwise be entitled.Please see FSIC IV’s prospectus for a more complete list of risks associated with investing in syndicated loans.







To invest in FSIC IV, an investor must have either (i) a net worth (not including home, furnishings and personal automobiles) of at least $70,000 and an annual gross income of at least $70,000, or (ii) a net worth (not including home, furnishings and personal automobiles) of at least $250,000. Some states impose heightened suitability standards. Please consult the prospectus for a detailed description of the suitability standards imposed on investors, including heightened standards required by certain states. 
Shares of FSIC IV are currently not available for investment by residents of New Jersey. This webpage is not approved for use in Massachusetts.
An investment in FSIC IV’s common stock involves significant costs and investors should review the information in FSIC IV’s prospectus regarding fees and expenses.

FS Investment Corporation IV Commences Operations

		  Represents fourth generation of Franklin Square's family of core income-generating BDCs
		

Jan 06, 2016, 16:45 ET
		  		  			
									 from   FS Investment Corporation IV 











 
















































 

 




















 


PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 6, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- FS Investment Corporation IV (FSIC IV), a new business development company sponsored by Franklin Square Capital Partners (Franklin Square), has satisfied its minimum offering requirement, admitted its initial public investors as stockholders and commenced operations. FSIC IV has registered for public sale in a continuous offering up to 250 million shares of common stock.
FSIC IV is a publicly registered, non-traded business development company (BDC) focused on investing primarily in the senior secured debt of private middle market U.S. companies, with the investment objective of generating current income and, to a lesser extent, long-term capital appreciation. It is one of the first BDCs to launch with a commission structure that is responsive to FINRA Regulatory Notice 15-02, lowering both upfront and all-in distribution fees, while seeking to align the interests of financial advisors, investors and the sponsor.
FSIC IV launched with over $9.1 million in capital, which included a meaningful sponsor commitment from affiliates of Franklin Square and FSIC IV's investment sub-adviser, GSO / Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC (GSO / Blackstone). GSO / Blackstone is an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners LP (GSO), the credit platform of Blackstone.
Building on the success of its predecessor funds, FS Investment Corporation (NYSE:   FSIC), FS Investment Corporation II (FSIC II) and FS Investment Corporation III (FSIC III), FSIC IV will seek to provide investors with a stable level of income and reduce overall portfolio volatility by targeting investments in private U.S. middle market companies. FSIC, Franklin Square's inaugural fund and the industry's first non-traded BDC, listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange on April 16, 2014, marking the first such liquidity event for a non-traded BDC. As a successor fund, FSIC IV intends to provide customized financing solutions to private U.S. middle market companies through the direct lending platform of GSO / Blackstone.
"We are pleased to launch the fourth generation of our core income fund franchise," said Michael C. Forman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of FSIC IV. "Just as Franklin Square pioneered the industry's first non-traded BDC, we believe FSIC IV combines the leading capabilities of our direct origination investment platform with an innovative commission structure that meets the needs of financial advisors and investors."
About Franklin Square
Franklin Square is a leading manager of alternative investment funds designed to enhance investors' portfolios by providing access to asset classes, strategies and asset managers that typically have been available to only the largest institutional investors. The firm's funds offer "endowment-style" investment strategies that help construct diversified portfolios and manage risk. Franklin Square strives not only to maximize investment returns but also to set the industry standard for best practices by focusing on transparency, investor protection and education for investment professionals and their clients.
Founded in Philadelphia in 2007, Franklin Square quickly established itself as a leader in the world of alternative investments by introducing innovative credit-based income funds, including the industry's first non-traded BDC. As of September 30, 2015, the firm managed approximately $17.0 billion in total assets, including $15.7 billion in BDC assets, making it the largest manager of BDCs.

	FSIC Overview



FS Investment Corporation (NYSE: FSIC) is a publicly traded business development company (BDC) focused on providing customized credit solutions to private middle market U.S. companies.  Investment approach  We seek to invest primarily in the senior secured debt and, to a lesser extent, the subordinated debt of private middle market U.S. companies to achieve the best risk-adjusted returns for our investors. In connection with our debt investments, we may on occasion receive or purchase equity interests such as common and preferred stock, warrants or options.  FSIC is differentiated by our flexible investment strategy which allows us to invest across the corporate capital structure and provide diversified exposure across multiple industries. Our core investment strategy is focused on direct originations and opportunistic investments, such as event-driven investments and anchor orders, which we believe allow us to take advantage of market inefficiencies. In certain circumstances we may also opportunistically invest in the broadly syndicated loan and high yield bond markets. Managers  FSIC is advised by FB Income Advisor, LLC, an affiliate of FS Investments, a leading manager of debt-focused alternative investment funds, and sub-advised by GSO / Blackstone Debt Funds Management LLC, an affiliate of GSO Capital Partners, the credit platform of Blackstone. With approximately $93 billion in assets under management as of March 31, 2017, GSO Capital Partners is one of the world’s largest credit-oriented alternative asset managers with approximately 345 employees in New York, London, Dublin and Houston. We seek to leverage our size and resources with GSO’s global brand, underwriting capabilities, network of relationships and origination platform to maximize returns and preserve capital.  Since FSIC’s inception in January 2009, it has grown to become one of the largest BDCs in the market. As of March 31, 2017, FSIC had approximately $4.3 billion in assets under management and investments in 108 portfolio companies across 16 industries.  FS Investments is the largest sponsor of BDC assets with approximately $18.3 billion in BDC assets under management as of March 31, 2017.

				Will Franklin Square start a nontraded product price war with its cheaper BDC?
	






































































































































On Advice









Will Franklin Square start a nontraded product price war with its cheaper BDC?
Forget 10%, the firm's new business development company has a hard cap on fees and commissions at 8.95% of gross offering proceeds






Jan 22, 2016 @ 2:11 pm

      Is Franklin Square Capital Partners, the sponsor of a series of nontraded business development companies, starting a price war in the nontraded investment industry?Franklin Square, with $17 billion in assets under management, may have lobbed its first grenade last fall when it filed the prospectus for its latest nontraded BDC, FS Investment Corporation IV. In its past BDCs, Franklin Square, like the vast majority of nontraded BDCs and real estate investment trust sponsors, have capped the total commissions paid to broker-dealers and registered reps at a hefty 10%. (More: SEC's Mary Jo White rips bill to ease restrictions on BDCs)




Ten percent for commissions and underwriting fees is the maximum allowed by industry rules. Ten percent for illiquid investment products like nontraded REITs and BDCs have been the standard for REIT and BDC sponsors, managers and the broker-dealers that sell the products. Indeed, when I have asked industry executives over the years why they have slavishly adhered to the 10% rule and asked whether it could ever go down, they typically responded by going all M.C. “U Can't Touch This” Hammer on me. But the independent broker-dealer industry has faced a torrent of criticism for being tied at the hip to nontraded product sponsors for that eye-popping 10%. When selling a nontraded BDC or REIT, the broker is typically paid 7%, his broker-dealer takes 1% or 2%, and the wholesale broker or manager, which is usually controlled by the product sponsor, takes the rest. That 10% fee structure, which can be onerous to the investor if a deal goes sour, may finally be changing. FS Investment Corporation IV just sliced off 105 basis points from the standard commission and underwriting fee nontraded BDCs and REITs typically charge clients. According to the company's prospectus, which was filed in October, the BDC is placing a hard cap on fees and commissions and will stop paying fees to reps and broker-dealers when the “total underwriting compensation” equals 8.95% of gross offering proceeds. The BDC, which broke escrow this month, is seeking to raise $2.65 billion and will invest in senior secured debt of private middle market U.S. companies. It's currently being sold at $10.60 per unit as a “T share,” a share class that pays less of an upfront commission to the broker but creates an annual trailing commission. (More: Franklin Square's Kelly: Growth, consolidation on tap in the BDC space)One Franklin Square executive wasn't about to admit to launching a price war with its competitors. “I don't see it that way,” said Zachary Klehr, executive vice president with Franklin Square. “The product's price is an important component and investors should look at it, but there are many fabulous features for investors in the 'T share' class.” It appears, however, that there is a bit of pricing voodoo in Franklin Square's ability to undercut its competition. In FS Investment Corp IV, the sponsor, Franklin Square, is kicking in 27 cents per share for a commission to the broker, thus allowing for a greater amount of the investor's money to go to work and buy assets. Part of the trailing commission pays back the sponsor over time. “The sponsor advancing commission, the alignment of interests between investors, advisers and the sponsor, that should generate a positive outcome for all,” Mr. Klehr said. The cut in underwriting compensation by Franklin Square comes at a time of incredible change for the nontraded investment industry, which took a huge hit last year. According to investment bank Robert A. Stanger & Co., nontraded REIT sales in 2015 dropped 36.1% from a year earlier to slightly less than $10 billion. Over the same time, nontraded BDC sales decreased 28.9% to $3.9 billion. There is no doubt that the Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary rule for retirement accounts and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc.'s new account statement rule to take effect in April have contributed to that drop. While it is often roundly criticized by the brokerage industry for being ineffectual, Finra has gone through the hard work of making its new account statement rule. Finra's goal was to bring greater pricing transparency to illiquid products and to put more investor money to work immediately rather than in the pockets of advisers and their broker-dealers. Franklin Square's new offering raises the question of whether other nontraded REIT and nontraded BDC sponsors are living up to the spirit of the rule, who's intent is to lower costs for the products. Nontraded BDCs and REITs remain attractive to some investors because they promise a stream of income in a near-zero interest rate environment. Is Franklin Square truly trying to shake up the nontraded investment industry, which has been criticized for selling high-priced products to unwary investors? Or is the firm simply making a good marketing play by capping commissions at 8.95% for its newest offering?
