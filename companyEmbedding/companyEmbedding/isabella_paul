                                Report abuseTranscript of Women's Rights18501900present18001950Women's RightsSeneca Falls Conference : 1848Occurred because Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott were not allowed to attend the World Anti-Slavery  ConventionAt the conference the women formed a list of goals in women's activism for many years to comeWomen and Women's rights supporters gathered to right a Declaration of Independence for women, called the Declaration of Sentiments"Ain't I a Woman?" : 1851Voting RightsIn 1890 the National Women's Suffrage Association and American Women's Suffrage Association merge to make the National American Women's Suffrage Association (NAWSA)NAWSA then makes it their goal to get women's voting rightsIn 1893 Colorado is the first state to allow Women to vote, many others follow thereafter Federal Level Rights     In 1919 the federal woman suffrage amendment, composed by Susan B. Anthony (introduced in Congress in 1878), is passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate. Then sent to the states for ratification.Labor RightsIn 1933 Frances Perkins becomes the first woman in a Presidential cabinet by serving  as Secretary of Labor during his entire Roosevelt presidency period. In 1941 A massive government and industry media campaign persuades women to take jobs during the war. Close 7 million women respond, 2 million as industrial "Rosie the Riveters" and 400,000 join the military. In 1945 Women industrial workers begin to lose their jobs in large numbers to returning service men, although surveys show 80% want to continue working. Pregnancy RightsIn 1978 the Pregnancy Discrimination Act bans employment discrimination or prejudice against pregnant women. Under the Act, a woman cannot be fired or denied a job or a promotion because she is or may become pregnant, she cannot be forced to take a pregnancy leave if she is willing and able to work.Current Women's EventsFormer President Jimmy Carter authors a new book, A Call to Action: Women, Religion, Violence and Power : http://www.bbc.com/news/world-26893444 (watch until 1:40)The Declaration of Sentiments         ......... He has usurped the prerogative of Jehovah himself, claiming it as his right to assign for her a sphere of action, when that belongs to her conscience and to her God.He has endeavored, in every way that he could, to destroy her confidence in her own powers, to lessen her self-respect, and to make her willing to lead a dependent and abject life.Now, in view of this entire disfranchisement of one-half the people of this country, their social and religious degradation--in view of the unjust laws above mentioned, and because women do feel themselves aggrieved, oppressed, and fraudulently deprived of their most sacred rights, we insist that they have immediate admission to all the rights and privileges which belong to them as citizens of the United States. Sojourner Truth delivers a moving speech in Akron, Ohio.www.youtube.com/watch?v=XilHJc9IZvEFull transcriptMore presentations by
