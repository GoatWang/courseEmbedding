Customer Questions & Answers








            can it be used on exterior decking ?
        

            would like to use as trim at deck posts.
        
Asked by: dillon

            Yes. The PVC shouldn't fade. Royal Mouldings manufacturers their PVC products for outdoor and indoor use.

            Can this molding be secured with a air powered brad nailer ?
        


Asked by: LILMAGS500

            Yes. Use small brads, however.

            Can this be used to cover TV wires?
        


Asked by: Valerie

            One could remove part of the back corner and there is ample material for the molding to still hold its shape. This could be done with a hand [block] plan, a table saw or a router table [the latter two using a guide to hold the material against the fence while performing the removal to achieve a consistent cut. I would not recommend attempting to do this with some form of hand saw or knife as the material has a lot of flex to it and that process could lead to injury.

            Can it b stained
        

            Example: I have looked at the manual and can't figure out what I did wrong.
        
Asked by: Jeffro

            No. Stain needs to be able to penetrate the surface and be absorbed be the product. Unlike wood, this is PVC plastic which doesn't support that. You can paint it though.

I used this molding under a shelf directly above our kitchen sink. I wanted to use PVC due to exposure to water. I was able to easily cut the trim using my 12" Ridgid Compound Miter Chop Saw and a high quality Forrest Blade for performing wood Cross-Cuts. The cut was extremely clean requiring no additional sanding or prep. I used "crazy glue" to assure the miter joint was perfect and affixed before placing the joined/attached trim to its location. I used construction adhesive and a few 22 gauge 3/4 inch nails to assure it held in place. Use of sealant to provide a professional finish was a snap. I'm very pleased with the use of this product and will look for other versions from Royal Mouldings in the future for a bathroom crown molding installation . . .

I bought this piece of trim to hide the wall gap along the back of the master bathroom double sink granite countertop in my rental. I did not have the option of putting a granite backsplash back there and stainless steel trim was really expensive. This material is water resistant, cuts like butter with a hand saw, and installed quickly with liquid nails. Overall, an inexpensive, easy, elegant solution to the problem.

Tutorial for the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM) package in VisTrailsProduct Type: Software DocumentationYear: 2012Author(s): Young, NSuggested Citation: Young, N. 2012. Tutorial for the Software for Assisted Habitat Modeling (SAHM) package in VisTrails. Fort Collins, CO: US Geological Survey, Fort Collins Science Center. 32 p. The purpose of this tutorial is to get the user familiar with the VisTrails Graphical User Interface (GUI) and more specifically, introduce the features and functionality of the software for assisted habitat modeling (SAHM) package. This tutorial will use an example to demonstrate how to input data, how to add and configure models to build a workflow, how to execute a model, how to modify a workflow and how to view the multiple types of model results. This example follows the work presented in the paper by Morisette et al. (2012) that demonstrates the development of a habitat distribution model of invasive cheatgrass in Rocky Mountain National Park, USA, at two different spatial resolutions using four different niche modeling techniques and three sets of predictor variables this tutorial may be updated periodically as additional features are added to SAHM or bugs are fixed. Please visit https://my.usgs.gov/catalog/RAM/SAHM to download the latest version.
