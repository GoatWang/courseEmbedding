BEFORE ACCESSING OUR WEBSITE AND ANY OFFERS YOU SHOULD READ THE FOLLOWING.
This section is intended for financial advisers and investment professionals only. It contains material that is not aimed at retail investors. Please do not proceed unless you are a financial adviser or an investment professional.
The information on this website does not and is not intended to constitute or form part of an offer, subscription recommendation or solicitation to buy or sell any financial product or to take up any services. The Mariana website does not offer investment or financial advice and should not be treated as doing so. If you are advising an investor or facilitating their investment (on an execution only basis, for example) in relation to a product referred to on the Mariana website you should satisfy yourself about the terms of the investment by reference to the full product documentation together with any ancillary materials which Mariana may provide and you should be familiar with the Key Features & Risks set out below for 1) Structured Investment products and 2) Tax Efficient Investment Products. Mariana is unable to provide any guidance as to whether a product is suitable for the individual circumstances of a client or appropriate for their attitude to risk.
Mariana does not offer Advice
The information contained on the Mariana website is for general information use only. It does not offer investment or financial advice and any information contained on this website should not be construed as investment, legal, tax or any other form of advice. If in any doubt about information on this website you should contact your account manager or email enquiries@marianacapital.com.
Past performance
Past performance is not an indication of future performance and should not be used to assess the future returns or the risk associated with your investment. It is possible to get back less than you originally invested in any of the investment products referred to herein.
Importance of Financial Advice
Investors considering an investment in a Mariana product must read and understand the full product brochure. It is important that the risks and potential rewards of a product are clearly explained to an investor by their adviser. You should note that Mariana insists that all applications to invest in Mariana product are placed through a regulated financial adviser.
Structured Investment Products: Key Features/Risks
 
Capital at Risk
Direct investment into a market brings with it the risks of that market since an investment’s value is likely to rise or fall in proportion to the movement of the market. Structured investment products are different in that they can change the risk and/or the return that an investment in a market may provide. Structured investment products achieve this by incorporating derivatives, named so because their performance is derived from the performance of the chosen underlying market, rather than investing directly into the market itself. Many structured investment products are not fully capital secure. They are described as ‘capital-at-risk’ and they offer enhanced income or growth but to achieve this put conditions on how or whether your capital will be repaid when the investment matures.
Counterparty Risk
Even when a structured investment product offers the full return of your capital, the return of capital is likely to be subject to counterparty risk. This is the risk that the issuer (the counterparty) of the investments underlying a product becomes insolvent or bankrupt. However remote this risk may appear, it always exists. To reduce it, we suggest that structured investment products are used only as part of a broader portfolio and that investors diversify their structured investment products across a range of counterparties. For more information about structured products and capital-at-risk products you can visit www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk.
Early encashment
Structured investments products are designed to be held until maturity and early encashment may result in a capital loss for a significant period of the investment term, particularly as there may be charges that adversely impact the value in the early years. There may also be liquidity constraints with structured investments before the stated maturity date. Details of these are outlined in our brochures.
Compensation/FSCS
Prospective investors should understand that Plan assets (i.e. the underlying investments) will be held on their behalf by the administrator and custodian but they will not have any direct legal interest in the investments or any direct rights against the issuing counterparty in the event that the counterparty becomes bankrupt or enters into an insolvency process and cannot pay its debts. Prospective investors should also be aware that under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) rules whilst they may be eligible for compensation in the case of the insolvency of Mariana or the administrator and custodian, they are unlikely to be eligible for compensation if the counterparty becomes insolvent.
Tax Efficient Investment Products: Key Features/Risks
 
Capital at Risk
Tax Efficient Investment Products typically invest in the shares of small higher risk unlisted companies. The valuation of these shares depends on the value of the assets acquired by the companies plus any income that is derived from those assets. This is not guaranteed and you may lose money. The value of shares can fall in value as well as rise and you may get back less than you invested.
Concentration Risk
The nature of the Tax Efficient Investment Product is to invest in a small number of unquoted companies and furthermore there is likely to be significant sector bias. Portfolio diversification will, therefore, be limited.
Liquidity Risk
Redeeming your investment may take time. Investments in unquoted companies can be difficult to sell, especially when compared with quoted companies where there is normally a liquid exchange for buyers and sellers. Mariana aims to provide funding to support on-going liquidity. However, these arrangements are not guaranteed
Forward looking statements
Brochures dealing with Tax Efficient Investment products may contain forward-looking financial statements and illustrations. Such forward-looking financial statements and illustrations, by their nature, are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties, and the actual results may differ materially as a result of various factors, and therefore reliance should not be placed upon them.
Legal and regulatory
There may be changes in the future to the legal framework and regulatory status surrounding the strategy of the Tax Efficient Investment Products and its investee companies and their assets. An example may include the reduction or removal altogether of UK government renewable energy subsidies and incentives like the RHI, ROC and FiT schemes, which may negatively affect the performance of Mariana Tax Efficient Investment Products.
Long term investment
In order to qualify for tax relief in relation to certain tax efficient strategies, investors may need to keep money in the relevant Tax Efficient Investment Product for at least a minimum qualifying period, and investors may need to continue holding the investments in some cases until their death to benefit from, for example, IHT relief.
Tax changes
Tax rates, benefits, allowances are based on the current levels, legislation and HMRC practice. More importantly they can vary significantly from person to person, and tax legislation is subject to change and cannot be guaranteed.
 
The Website
Considerable care has gone into the preparation and maintenance of this website. However, Mariana accepts no liability in connection with its use or the use of information it contains. No warranty is given as to the accuracy or completeness of the information it contains and no liability is accepted for any errors or omissions.

RISK WARNING
The following pages refer to Mariana investment products. It is important that you read and understand the risk statements below before you proceed.
Mariana’s investment products may provide both individual and institutional investors with flexible and innovative investment solutions offering varying levels of risk, asset exposure, capital protection and tax exposure.
It is important, however, that you understand the risks attached to your investments. The key risk factors are summarised below, but please remember that these are general risks and the risks that are relevant to individual products are set out in the brochure for that product.
Mariana does not provide investment advice in relation to investment products and we strongly recommend that you discuss any proposed investment with your financial adviser before you invest.
Investment in a Mariana product should form part only of your investment portfolio. You should also maintain savings you can access at short notice in case of emergency to meet any short term cash needs that may arise during the term of your investment.
Investment Risk – This is the risk arising from the market(s) or asset(s) into which your investment is made or to which the performance of your investment is linked. Their value might decrease, which could cause you to lose money or, if they increase, the amount of the increase may be greater than the return you get from your investment in a Mariana product.
Counterparty Risk – This is the risk that the financial institution by whom your investment is backed gets into financial difficulties and does not, or cannot, pay the amounts due in relation to your investment. This could cause you to lose some or all of your money and any investment returns that would have otherwise been payable.
Term Risk – This is the risk that an investor’s circumstances could change, forcing the early encashment of an investment. Such early encashment will be subject to a fee and the amount repaid is likely to be less than the initial capital invested. An investor should be aware that they may not be able to access the value of their investment immediately.
Inflation Risk – This is the risk that inflation may reduce the real value of your investment over time.
Tax Risk – The values of any tax reliefs generated by your investment will depend on your individual circumstances. You should note that the levels and bases of taxation and reliefs available may change in the future and changes may be applied retrospectively.
ISA Transfer Risk – if you wish to transfer an existing ISA, it must be done in cash. This means that your existing ISA manager will sell your investment and you are likely to be charged an exit fee. There is then the possibility of a loss of income or growth if markets should rise while your transfer is being processed.
Cancellation Risk – This is the risk that if you decide to cancel the investment after it has been purchased you are likely to lose some of your money.
It is important that you read all the related Mariana product literature carefully and in full so that you understand how the product works and can decide whether or not you are prepared to accept the risks and the possible consequences of investing in a particular product, before proceeding with your investment.

Company Description


Marianas Fund Management focuses on directional investing on a global basis primarily in publicly traded equity securities and derivative instruments related to commodities, currencies, and basic industries. The firm seeks to invest in undervalued securities and sell short overvalued securities, employing a rigorous investment research and investment valuation process to do so. Marianas assesses, among other things, the micro economics of a company's business model, the competitive position of the business, the supply and demand economics of the industry, the quality of the management team's operating and capital allocation decision process, and the company's financial position. Marianas utilizes these inputs to predict the business's long term sustainable earnings power and to accurately value the business. Marianas focuses their investments on instances when a wide gap exists between market perception and economic reality. The Marianas Master Fund intends to invest in the equities of undervalued businesses with attractive economics and short equities of overvalued businesses with poor and deteriorating economics. The fund takes long, short, speculative, and hedged positions; utilizes various forms of leverage, and engages in stock lending transactions. The fund may borrow, lend and pledge money and investments and engages in financing transactions, including purchasing securities on margin, engaging in repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions.

What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

Will Snellings, portfolio manager and partner at Ospraie Management LLC, is spinning out of Dwight
Anderson's firm to start a global long-short equity hedge fund,
according to a presentation provided to Bloomberg News.
     The Marianas Fund will trade opportunistically in
commodities, according to the presentation. The Marianas
strategy within Ospraie, run by Snellings since March 2012, had
$37 million in assets as of April and rose 8.1 percent in the
first four months of the year and 17 percent in the 10 months it
traded last year, the firm said in the presentation.
     Anderson's Ospraie will provide operational support and
infrastructure to the Marianas Fund, according to the
presentation.
     Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesman for New York-based
Ospraie, declined to comment.
