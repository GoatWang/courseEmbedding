Digital Millennium Copyright Act Notice Form
The Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") is a United States copyright law that provides guidelines for online service providers in case of copyright infringement. Below is the information that should be present in these notices. It is designed to make submitting notices of alleged infringement to us as straightforward as possible while reducing the number of notices that we receive that are fraudulent or difficult to understand or verify. The form of notice specified below is consistent with the DMCA, which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office website, http://www.copyright.gov.
To file a notice of infringement with us, you must provide us with the items specified below. Please note that you will be liable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that the material is infringing your copyright. Accordingly, if you are not sure whether material infringes your copyright, we suggest that you first contact an attorney.
This notice and any attachments we receive will be forwarded to the alleged infringer, who will then have the opportunity to file a counter notification pursuant to Sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of the DMCA. Should a properly filed counter notification be filed, you will be notified and have 10 business days within which to file for a restraining order in Federal Court to prevent the reinstatement of the material.

Phillip LoPresti President and CEO, Everspin
Most recently at Intersil

        This is a Press Release edited by StorageNewsletter.com on 2010.07.16





 



Everspin Technologies, Inc., in MRAM products, has named  Phillip LoPresti its president and chief executive officer. 
 
LoPresti brings more than 25 years of engineering, sales and marketing experience in the semiconductor industry, including specific expertise leading a startup in an emerging technology sector.
LoPresti most recently directed the high-speed data converter efforts at Intersil Corporation, after joining the company when it acquired semiconductor startup Kenet, Inc. When the two companies merged in 2008, LoPresti led the successful integration of the Kenet team and products into Intersil's analog mixed-signal business, while expanding the company's product portfolio and customer base.
Prior to Intersil, LoPresti was president and CEO of Kenet, where he grew the company's efforts to commercialize low-power mixed-signal technology for portable consumer and communications applications. In a two and a half year period, LoPresti successfully launched more than 50 new products and secured multiple customer designs, ultimately establishing Kenet as a premier data converter company and culminating in the successful merger with Intersil.
"I am looking forward to building on MRAM's success across multiple markets and leading Everspin through the next stage of our technology development," said Phillip LoPresti. "Our strong product portfolio and proven track record positions us to expand market share as more customers recognize the value of our products. Everspin is focused on leveraging its MRAM expertise and resources to accelerate the introduction of new products in development based on our next-generation, high density Spin Torque MRAM technology."
Prior to Kenet, LoPresti spent more than 20 years at NEC Electronics America. In his last 10 years with NEC, he held several executive positions leading up to associate vice president and general manager of the Custom LSI Solutions strategic business unit, where he oversaw the expansion of the company's ASIC technology business in North America.
LoPresti holds both bachelor's and master's of science degrees in electrical engineering from Boston University.
