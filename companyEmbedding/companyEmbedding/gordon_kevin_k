For two years we interacted almost every single day on various aspects of the project, from nuts and bolts programming and tooling all the way up to higher-level design issues. I always enjoyed working with Kevin.  We accomplished some significant work and it all occurred with only a few hundred miles of separation.  

I appreciated not only his experience and good judgement but his ability to just get down in the code and make something happen.  His effort and dedication were recognized by many of our team members.  They certainly impressed me.  I would love to work with him again (in person next time OR from afar) and definitely recommend him to others.See moreSee lessKevin and I worked together for 2 years at Emergent Space Technologies, on the Cluster Flight Application for DARPAs System F6 Program. Kevin was an invaluable member of the software team and a real leader. Kevin strives hard to meet challenging deadlines, objectives, and solve difficult technical issues. He is truly an excellent team member, in every sense of the word. Working with Kevin was a real pleasure and joy. He is easy going, hard working, and gives 100% in all his work.

SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., Dec. 13, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Veracyte, Inc. (NASDAQ:   VCYT), a genomic diagnostics company that reduces unnecessary surgeries and healthcare costs by resolving diagnostic uncertainty, today announced that Kevin K. Gordon, former chief operating officer of Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc., has been appointed to the company's board of directors. Veracyte also announced that Brian Atwood, who has served as director and chairman since the company's founding, has elected to step down from the board. Concurrently, Bonnie Anderson, Veracyte's president and chief executive officer, has assumed the additional role of chairman of the board and John L. Bishop will become the lead independent director. All changes are effective as of December 12, 2016.








"We are honored to welcome Kevin to our board of directors," said Ms. Anderson. "His knowledge, insight and years of healthcare industry experience with large publicly held companies, combined with his strong financial background, will be invaluable as we scale the company and focus on achieving profitable growth." 
Mr. Gordon served as executive vice president and COO of Quintiles, a leading global bio-pharmaceutical services provider, from October 2015 until its merger with IMS Health in October 2016. He served as the company's executive vice president and chief financial officer from 2010 to 2015. The Fortune 500 company recorded revenue of $4.3 billion in 2015 and was named to Fortune's list of the "World's Most Admired Companies." Prior to that, Mr. Gordon spent 13 years in senior leadership positions at Teleflex Incorporated, a diversified global company with over $2 billion in annual revenue, serving most recently as CFO. He previously held senior management positions at KPMG.
"Veracyte is fundamentally improving patient care with its novel focus on resolving diagnostic uncertainty and reducing unnecessary surgeries," said Mr. Gordon. "I am delighted to join the Veracyte board and look forward to helping the company achieve its growth and profitability goals."
Ms. Anderson continued, "On behalf of the company and board of directors, I would like to thank Brian for his extraordinary dedication and guidance in building Veracyte into the formidable diagnostics company that it is today. Because of his invaluable leadership, Veracyte is well-positioned to create long-term, sustained value for our shareholders."
About VeracyteVeracyte (NASDAQ:    VCYT) is pioneering the field of molecular cytology, offering genomic solutions that resolve diagnostic ambiguity and enable physicians to make more informed treatment decisions at an early stage in patient care. By improving preoperative diagnostic accuracy, the company aims to help patients avoid unnecessary invasive procedures while reducing healthcare costs. Veracyte's Afirma® Thyroid FNA Analysis centers on the proprietary Afirma Gene Expression Classifier (GEC) and is becoming a new standard of care in thyroid nodule assessment. The Afirma test is recommended in leading practice guidelines and is covered for 185 million lives in the United States, including through Medicare and many commercial insurance plans. Veracyte is expanding its molecular cytology franchise to other clinical areas, beginning with difficult-to-diagnose lung diseases.
