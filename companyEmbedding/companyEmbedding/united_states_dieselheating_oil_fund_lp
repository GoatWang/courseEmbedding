Fund Details
The United States Oil Fund® LP (USO) is an exchange-traded security designed to track the daily price movements of West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") light, sweet crude oil. USO issues shares that may be purchased and sold on the NYSE Arca.
The investment objective of USO is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' NAV to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma, as measured by the daily changes in price of USO's Benchmark Oil Futures Contract, less USO's expenses.
USO's Benchmark is the near month crude oil futures contract traded on the NYMEX. If the near month futures contract is within two weeks of expiration, the Benchmark will be the next month contract to expire. The crude oil contract is WTI light, sweet crude oil delivered to Cushing, Oklahoma.
USO invests primarily in listed crude oil futures contracts and other oil-related futures contracts, and may invest in forwards and swap contracts. These investments will be collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, and US government obligations with remaining maturities of two years or less. 
USO's Fund Benefits

USO offers commodity exposure without using a commodity futures account.
USO provides "equity-like" features including, intra-day pricing, and market, limit, and stop orders.
USO provides portfolio holdings, market price, NAV and TNA on its website each day.

The above frequency distribution chart presents information about the difference between the daily market price for shares of the Fund and the Fund's reported net asset value. The amount that the fund's market price is above the reported NAV is called the premium. The amount that the fund's market price is below the reported NAV is called the discount. The market price is determined using the midpoint between the highest bid and the lowest offer on the listing exchange, as of the time that the Fund's NAV is calculated (usually 4:00 pm Eastern time). The horizontal axis of the chart shows the premium or discount expressed in basis points. The vertical axis indicates the number of trading days in the period covered by the chart. Each bar in the chart shows the number of trading days in which the Fund traded within the premium/discount range indicated.
 
* A basis point is equal to 1/100th of 1% and is used to denote the change in a financial instrument.

					Full Description



United States Diesel-Heating Oil Fund, LP (UHN), incorporated on April 13, 2007, is a commodity pool that issues limited partnership interests (shares) traded on the NYSE Arca, Inc. (the NYSE Arca). The investment objective of UHN is for the daily changes in percentage terms of its shares' per share net asset value (NAV) to reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of the spot price of heating oil (also known as No. 2 fuel oil) for delivery to the New York harbor, as measured by the daily changes in the price of the futures contract for heating oil traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), that is the near month contract to expire, except when the near month contract is within two weeks of expiration, in which case it will be measured by the futures contract that is the next month contract to expire (the Benchmark Futures Contract), less UHN's expenses. United States Commodity Funds LLC is the general partner of UHN.The net assets of UHN consist primarily of investments in futures contracts for diesel-heating oil, and also consists of investments in futures contracts for crude oil, gasoline, natural gas and other petroleum-based fuels that are traded on the NYMEX, Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) Futures or other United States and foreign exchanges (collectively, Futures Contracts). In order to comply with regulatory requirements or in view of market conditions, UHM also invests in other diesel-heating oil-related investments, such as cash-settled options on Futures Contracts, forward contracts for diesel-heating oil, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded (over-the-counter) transactions that are based on the price of diesel-heating oil, crude oil and other petroleum-based fuels, Futures Contracts and indices based on the foregoing (collectively, Other Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments). UHN invests primarily in Futures Contracts while supporting such investments by holding the amounts of its margin, collateral and other requirements relating to the obligations in short-term obligations of the United States of two years or less (Treasuries), cash and cash equivalents. UHN's total portfolio composition is disclosed on its Website each business day that the NYSE Arca is open for trading. The Website disclosure of portfolio holdings is made daily, and includes the name and value of each diesel-heating oil interest, the specific types of Other Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments and characteristics of such Other Diesel-Heating Oil-Related Investments, the name and value of each Treasury and cash equivalent, and the amount of cash held in UHN's portfolio. BBH&Co. is UHN's custodian and administrator, and ALPS Distributors, Inc. is its marketing agent.
