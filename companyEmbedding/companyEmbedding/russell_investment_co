History[edit]

1936 — Local businessman Frank Russell starts a small brokerage firm in Tacoma, Washington.
1958 — George Russell joins his grandfather's firm, Frank Russell Company. Six months later, George becomes chairman, president and CEO when his grandfather dies. The company has two employees — George and an assistant.
1974 — Russell's institutional consulting business grows from a single client to 40 major U.S. clients, including AT&T and General Motors.
1979 — Russell initiates its global presence with the opening of an office in London.
1980 — Russell launches its investment management business in response to a client's request for funds that provide a fully diversified and packaged blend of investment managers. Russell begins leveraging its research of outside managers[clarification needed] to create a manager-of-managers investment process for smaller retirement plans and individuals.
1984 — Russell researchers create the Russell 1000, Russell 2000, and Russell 3000 Indexes as benchmarks for evaluating manager performance. Russell opens an office in Toronto, Ontario.
1986 — Russell opens an office in Tokyo, Japan and opens an office in Sydney, Australia.
1988 — Russell dedicates a new headquarters building in Tacoma, Wash.
1990 — Mike Phillips is named president of Frank Russell Company. In 1993, he is named chief executive officer. George Russell continues as chairman. George Russell establishes Russell 20-20, a group of independent money managers and plan sponsors who explore emerging markets with an eye toward investment opportunities.
1999 — Russell expands to Singapore. Northwestern Mutual, the largest provider of individual life insurance in the United States, acquires Russell. The company retains the Russell name, management, office locations and investment approach.
2002 — George Russell retires, retaining the role of chairman emeritus for Frank Russell Company and Russell 20-20.
2003 — Russell changes its business name to Russell Investment Group. Craig Ueland is appointed president of Russell in July 2003 and then CEO effective January 2004.
2004 — In March, Russell acquires Pantheon Ventures, the global private equity fund-of-funds specialist headquartered in London. In August, Russell acquires the Australian HR services operation of Towers Perrin.
2007 — Russell's family of U.S. equity indexes goes global with the launch of a family of global stock indexes. Russell opens an office in Seoul, Korea.
2008 — Russell investments announced that they might leave Tacoma, having outgrown their old headquarters. The lease on the headquarters on A Street expires in 2013. Local government officials, wary of losing the biggest company in downtown Tacoma, have started an attractive campaign to keep Russell in Tacoma, including plans for a brand new headquarters.[5][6]




FT reports that Russell Investments is to close two of its three main hedge funds following a sharp drop in assets under management to less than two billion USD. Investors were already gated and redemptions reported to be high. Many staff in the Alternatives Division were laid off, with the few remaining persons employed to oversee the wind-down process of the above.




2009 — ::Russell’s Board of Directors named Andrew Doman as Russell’s new Chief Executive Officer. Andrew Doman assumed role of President upon John Schlifske's return to Northwestern Mutual. :: Russell Investments said they would move headquarters from Tacoma to Chase Center in Seattle.
2010 — Russell Investments completes move of headquarters to Seattle. The former Chase Center building is now renamed Russell Investments Center.
2011 — ::Russell's Board of Directors named Len Brennan as Russell's new Chief Executive Officer. He is also chief executive of the firm's Europe, Middle East, Africa business. ::Russell Investments opens its first regional office in Germany with the launch of Frankfurt operations during October.
2014 — Northwestern Mutual sells Russell Investments to London Stock Exchange Group for $2.7 billion.
2015 — LSEG separates Russell's Index business from the consulting, asset management and consulting business by forming "FTSE Russell" brand[7]
2016 — London Stock Exchange Group completes[8] sale of Russell Investments to TA Associates and Reverence Capital Partners for $1.15 billion. LSEG kept the indexes side of the business as FTSE Russell.
2017 — Willis Towers Watson signs a definitive agreement to acquire its stand-alone Australian actuarial business for an undisclosed sum.[9]

Products and services[edit]
Russell provides financial and investment services to institutional clients such as pension funds, non-profits, healthcare systems and defined contribution plans.[10][10][11] Individual investors can access these services through one of Russell's 580 partners, such as banks, brokers and insurance companies.[12][13]
Russell launched its family of U.S. indexes in 1984 to measure the U.S. market segments. The resulting methodology produced the broad market Russell 3000 Index and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index. The Russell Global Index, introduced in 2007, captures 98% of the global equity market and reflects the performance of more than 10,000 stocks worldwide. As of June 30, 2008, Russell's U.S. indexes have US$4.0 trillion in assets benchmarked to them and account for 63.3 percent of U.S. equity products benchmarked by U.S. institutional investors. Russell/Nomura equity indexes (calculated with Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.) offer broad market or style benchmarks for investors in Japan.[citation needed]
After purchasing all of Russell from NorthWest Mutual in 2014,[14] the London Stock Exchange Group announced on May 18, 2015 the launch of ‘FTSE Russell’, the new integrated name created for the combined businesses of FTSE Group and Russell Indexes. Effectively splitting out the index business from Russell's advice, asset management and investment management offerings, FTSE Russell will now operate as one joint global index business which is no longer owned by Russell Investments or TA Associates.[15]
In North America, Russell delivers target date and target portfolio products directly to Defined Contribution (DC) plan sponsors, as well as distributes LifePoints Funds through financial professionals.

History[edit]

1936 — Local businessman Frank Russell starts a small brokerage firm in Tacoma, Washington.
1958 — George Russell joins his grandfather's firm, Frank Russell Company. Six months later, George becomes chairman, president and CEO when his grandfather dies. The company has two employees — George and an assistant.
1974 — Russell's institutional consulting business grows from a single client to 40 major U.S. clients, including AT&T and General Motors.
1979 — Russell initiates its global presence with the opening of an office in London.
1980 — Russell launches its investment management business in response to a client's request for funds that provide a fully diversified and packaged blend of investment managers. Russell begins leveraging its research of outside managers[clarification needed] to create a manager-of-managers investment process for smaller retirement plans and individuals.
1984 — Russell researchers create the Russell 1000, Russell 2000, and Russell 3000 Indexes as benchmarks for evaluating manager performance. Russell opens an office in Toronto, Ontario.
1986 — Russell opens an office in Tokyo, Japan and opens an office in Sydney, Australia.
1988 — Russell dedicates a new headquarters building in Tacoma, Wash.
1990 — Mike Phillips is named president of Frank Russell Company. In 1993, he is named chief executive officer. George Russell continues as chairman. George Russell establishes Russell 20-20, a group of independent money managers and plan sponsors who explore emerging markets with an eye toward investment opportunities.
1999 — Russell expands to Singapore. Northwestern Mutual, the largest provider of individual life insurance in the United States, acquires Russell. The company retains the Russell name, management, office locations and investment approach.
2002 — George Russell retires, retaining the role of chairman emeritus for Frank Russell Company and Russell 20-20.
2003 — Russell changes its business name to Russell Investment Group. Craig Ueland is appointed president of Russell in July 2003 and then CEO effective January 2004.
2004 — In March, Russell acquires Pantheon Ventures, the global private equity fund-of-funds specialist headquartered in London. In August, Russell acquires the Australian HR services operation of Towers Perrin.
2007 — Russell's family of U.S. equity indexes goes global with the launch of a family of global stock indexes. Russell opens an office in Seoul, Korea.
2008 — Russell investments announced that they might leave Tacoma, having outgrown their old headquarters. The lease on the headquarters on A Street expires in 2013. Local government officials, wary of losing the biggest company in downtown Tacoma, have started an attractive campaign to keep Russell in Tacoma, including plans for a brand new headquarters.[5][6]




FT reports that Russell Investments is to close two of its three main hedge funds following a sharp drop in assets under management to less than two billion USD. Investors were already gated and redemptions reported to be high. Many staff in the Alternatives Division were laid off, with the few remaining persons employed to oversee the wind-down process of the above.




2009 — ::Russell’s Board of Directors named Andrew Doman as Russell’s new Chief Executive Officer. Andrew Doman assumed role of President upon John Schlifske's return to Northwestern Mutual. :: Russell Investments said they would move headquarters from Tacoma to Chase Center in Seattle.
2010 — Russell Investments completes move of headquarters to Seattle. The former Chase Center building is now renamed Russell Investments Center.
2011 — ::Russell's Board of Directors named Len Brennan as Russell's new Chief Executive Officer. He is also chief executive of the firm's Europe, Middle East, Africa business. ::Russell Investments opens its first regional office in Germany with the launch of Frankfurt operations during October.
2014 — Northwestern Mutual sells Russell Investments to London Stock Exchange Group for $2.7 billion.
2015 — LSEG separates Russell's Index business from the consulting, asset management and consulting business by forming "FTSE Russell" brand[7]
2016 — London Stock Exchange Group completes[8] sale of Russell Investments to TA Associates and Reverence Capital Partners for $1.15 billion. LSEG kept the indexes side of the business as FTSE Russell.
2017 — Willis Towers Watson signs a definitive agreement to acquire its stand-alone Australian actuarial business for an undisclosed sum.[9]

Products and services[edit]
Russell provides financial and investment services to institutional clients such as pension funds, non-profits, healthcare systems and defined contribution plans.[10][10][11] Individual investors can access these services through one of Russell's 580 partners, such as banks, brokers and insurance companies.[12][13]
Russell launched its family of U.S. indexes in 1984 to measure the U.S. market segments. The resulting methodology produced the broad market Russell 3000 Index and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index. The Russell Global Index, introduced in 2007, captures 98% of the global equity market and reflects the performance of more than 10,000 stocks worldwide. As of June 30, 2008, Russell's U.S. indexes have US$4.0 trillion in assets benchmarked to them and account for 63.3 percent of U.S. equity products benchmarked by U.S. institutional investors. Russell/Nomura equity indexes (calculated with Nomura Securities Co., Ltd.) offer broad market or style benchmarks for investors in Japan.[citation needed]
After purchasing all of Russell from NorthWest Mutual in 2014,[14] the London Stock Exchange Group announced on May 18, 2015 the launch of ‘FTSE Russell’, the new integrated name created for the combined businesses of FTSE Group and Russell Indexes. Effectively splitting out the index business from Russell's advice, asset management and investment management offerings, FTSE Russell will now operate as one joint global index business which is no longer owned by Russell Investments or TA Associates.[15]
In North America, Russell delivers target date and target portfolio products directly to Defined Contribution (DC) plan sponsors, as well as distributes LifePoints Funds through financial professionals.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Russell Investments' history | Russell Investments


















































Russell Investments' history
A history of growth and innovation

1936 — Our company started simply, when Frank Russell opened his brokerage firm in Tacoma, Washington. 


1958 — George Russell, fresh from Harvard Business School, joined his grandfather's business 22 years later. After just a few months, Frank died unexpectedly, leaving George and one assistant as the total staff. George didn't falter. For 10 years, he built our company into a successful money management business.


1969 — George identified a need—companies required help determining which money managers were the best at managing pension investments. George developed an evaluation process and pitched it to JC Penney. The era of institutional investment consulting began. And JC Penney is still a client today. To expand George's idea to other American businesses, the company opened a New York office. In five short years, we acquired 40 major U.S. clients.


1979 — It was time to go international. George hired Jan Twardowski to open an office in London and our global commitment began.


1980 — We started managing money directly for institutions rather than simply providing advice. Our assets under management (AUM) began to grow.


1984 — Our researchers saw a need for a better measurement of money manager success. So they created the Russell Indexes—benchmarks that are used more today than all other institutional indexes combined.


1986 — Our global expansion continued, with new offices in Tokyo and Sydney.


1990 — Six months after the Berlin Wall fell, George founded Russell 20-20 to connect countries in need of capital with influential money managers and financial experts.


1993 — George appointed Mike Phillips as our CEO, only the third CEO since 1936.


1999 — Northwestern Mutual, the largest provider of individual life insurance in the U.S., acquired us, but our name, management, office locations, investment approach, and company culture remained intact. In fact, that was the same year we received honors as number 15 on the Fortune Magazine "Best Companies to Work for in America" list.


2003 — Craig Ueland was appointed president in July 2003 and then became our fourth CEO, effective January 2004.


2004 — We reached US$100 billion in assets under management this year. By the end of 2004, our AUM rose to $134 billion. This is also when we acquired Pantheon, the global private equity fund-of-funds specialist headquartered in London, and the Australian HR services operation of Towers Perrin in August—a move that added more than 270 Russell associates to our ranks and enabled us to offer an unmatched array of investment and administrative services.


2005 — We began our Focused Giving Initiative by committing new philanthropic dollars to support projects that address financial literacy and children.


2007 — Our market-leading family of U.S. equity indexes went global with the launch of the Russell Global Indexes. And we were proud to be ranked number 30 on Fortune Magazine's "Best Companies to Work For in America" list. In addition, we surpassed US$220 billion in assets under management (AUM) by midsummer.


2009 — Russell Investments names Andrew S. Doman president and CEO.


2010 — Russell Investments opens new headquarters office in Seattle, Washington.


2011 — Russell Investments names Len Brennan president and CEO.


2014 — London Stock Exchange Group completes acquisition of Russell Investments.


2015 — Establishes wholly foreign-owned enterprise in China: Russell Investments Advisors Shanghai Ltd.
2016 — TA Associates and Reverence Capital Partners complete acquisition of Russell Investments’ asset management business from London Stock Exchange Group.
