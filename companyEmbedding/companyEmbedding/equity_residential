Equity Residential - Charge rent when they were turning over apartment




                                    We ended our lease early with the agreement that if the apartment was rented, we could get out of our lease. It was quickly rented. The new tenants were to move in at the of May. We moved out the 21st. They charged us rent from the time we moved out until the time that...

Equity Residential - Rental Pricing Games





 



 



 



 



 




                                    I have lived in Sheffield Court in Arlington, VA for 5 years. Expect them to try to increase your rent $100+ yearly. If you look at the available apartments online and see your model and floor listed for a cheaper price, they will not match that price when you renew....

Equity Residential - Elevator Breaks Every 2 Months




                                    One or both of the elevators in our apartment breaks every 2 months and on top of that it one of the slowest elevators I've ever ridden on. It takes the same amount of time to reach my 54th in my condo overseas, then it takes to get to the 4th floor at Artisan on 2nd....

                                    On March 17,2017 when returning home I noticed my garage door was opened without my knowledge.

Equity Residential Customer Care Review




                                    Well that confirms it, This company has no idea as how to operate a NYC luxury property. You see they fire anyone who might attempt to instruct or advise them of the NYC codes and regulations. Believe me they have circumvented every expectation of NYC luxury apartment...

Equity Residential - The only thing Equity is good for is platitudes




                                    Use to be a nice place to live then equity bought the place and it went downhill. Massive construction for the last several years and nothing to show for it. They redid the pool which now looks like a prison, the parking garage, building facade, and now the lobby. That...

Equity Residential Inadequate Property Management And Maintenance Review




                                     They don't have enough maintenance because the maintenance is shared between complexes. The ceiling in the outside hallway continues to bubble up every time it rains. Constant roof leaks all over the complex. They would cover it up with paint and not solve the...

Equity Residential - Equity properties - a total rip off




                                    I had to agree with most of the reviews. At equity properties they try get as much money as possible from you. At every lease renewal they increase the rent a lot but for new customers they will still give at a less price. Worst part is move out. They will unload what...

Los Angeles Apartments
Learn more about living in our Los Angeles apartments

The City of Angels is a sprawling metropolis of highways, gorgeous landscapes, a network of treasured landmarks and a lot of Hollywood sparkle. Whether residents and visitors head straight for the city’s glamour in hopes to make it big or just because they simply want to take advantage of the famous California sunshine, there are plenty of Los Angeles apartments and neighborhoods to choose from, all with their own unique personalities and perks.If it’s nightlife you’re after, head over Downtown LA, West Hollywood or Silver Lake, all of which offer a growing list of restaurants and clubs serving up handcrafted cocktails and a hip local crowd; when you’re looking for celeb status and sightings, Bel Air, Beverly Hills and the Hollywood Hills offer amazing views of LA’s stunning landscapes and fantastic homes; and for serene waterfront landmarks, make your way to Malibu, Hermosa Beach and Venice, which offer their fair share of local entertainment and stunning beaches. No matter which neighborhood you choose, there are unique Los Angeles apartments around every corner.Getting to these Los Angeles apartments and neighborhoods is easy, thanks to nearby highways and plenty of public transit options. The city’s six rail lines - the Metro Expo, Red, Purple, Gold, Blue and Green lines - make regular runs to many LA neighborhoods, so leaving the car parked safely at home and avoiding the traffic is an option. The 200 local bus and DASH lines make hundreds of stops Downtown, travel the freeway and offer riders ways to get around town, thanks to bus transponders that send signals to LA’s traffic signals. But when driving is most convenient, LA is one of the most connected cities in the country.There’s more to LA than the glitz and glamour of the nearby Hollywood Hills and celeb scene. Foodies flock to incredible chef-run restaurants like n/naka and Melisse, and shops on Robertson and Rodeo Drive are must-visit destinations for locals and visitors alike. Annual celebrations, awards shows, art fairs, farmers markets, parades and pro sports games draw more than 44 million visitors each year, meaning locals living in Los Angeles apartments can beat the tourist rush and enjoy all that LA has to offer, year-round.

Robust 2Q17
Equity Residential’s (EQR) top line in 2Q17 surpassed both the year-ago results as well as management’s expectations on rent growth.

REITs have been thriving in the industrial segment due to the record high level of rent growth for the past few years. Rent growth moderated in the second half of 2016 after residential property owners increased their supply by increasing housing starts. However, the supply is still far behind the demand, especially in Class A cities. As a result, the rent has remained at high levels in high-barrier, high-demand cities.



Equity Residential has maintained a modest rent growth trend. Its strategic placement in six coastal markets in Washington, DC, New York, Southern California, Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco has been a winning strategy, and its development activities have helped it maintain higher demand for its properties. Occupancy remained almost flat during the quarter. The average rent rate went up 2.5% during the quarter.
Rent growth expected to moderate
Equity Residential updated its revenue and occupancy guidance for fiscal 2017. Management now expects physical occupancy to stand at 95.8% compared to the 95.7% expected earlier. Equity Residential expects revenue to go up in a range of 1.8% to 2.3% compared to the 1% to 2.3% expected previously.
AvalonBay Communities (AVB), Camden Property (CPT), and Essex Property (ESS) are expected to report revenue of $529.1 million, $222.7 million, and $334.8 million, respectively, for 2Q17.
Equity Residential and its peers form almost 9% of the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ), which has a wide product portfolio covering industries like healthcare, self storage, and residential REITs. VNQ has a net asset value of $81.2 million.

Re Mentor


                            My sister and I have been enrolled in Dave's coaching program for about 4 months at this point. Our advisor is knowledgeable and patient, Dave's boot camp was excellent and his other materials have been very thorough and helpful. We have no complaints so far. Learning any new business takes time, effort and grit. You'll work your tush off if you want to be successful, but Dave and his team can help you avoid a lot of mishaps along the way.                         Read more

REITs have been thriving in the industrial segment due to the record high level of rent growth for the past few years. Rent growth moderated in the second half of 2016 after residential property owners increased their supply by increasing housing starts. However, the supply is still far behind the demand, especially in Class A cities. As a result, the rent has remained at high levels in high-barrier, high-demand cities.



Equity Residential has maintained a modest rent growth trend. Its strategic placement in six coastal markets in Washington, DC, New York, Southern California, Boston, Seattle, and San Francisco has been a winning strategy, and its development activities have helped it maintain higher demand for its properties. Occupancy remained almost flat during the quarter. The average rent rate went up 2.5% during the quarter.
Rent growth expected to moderate
Equity Residential updated its revenue and occupancy guidance for fiscal 2017. Management now expects physical occupancy to stand at 95.8% compared to the 95.7% expected earlier. Equity Residential expects revenue to go up in a range of 1.8% to 2.3% compared to the 1% to 2.3% expected previously.
AvalonBay Communities (AVB), Camden Property (CPT), and Essex Property (ESS) are expected to report revenue of $529.1 million, $222.7 million, and $334.8 million, respectively, for 2Q17.
Equity Residential and its peers form almost 9% of the Vanguard REIT ETF (VNQ), which has a wide product portfolio covering industries like healthcare, self storage, and residential REITs. VNQ has a net asset value of $81.2 million.
