Solutions & Services
Custom solutions to strengthen your legacy
To meet the unique needs of our clients, Raymond James Trust, N.A. can serve in a number of roles, including trustee, co-trustee, custodian, personal representative, or agent to a trustee on several types of personal trusts. As trustee, Raymond James Trust offers the professional management of skilled experts, impartiality in making investment decisions and dealing with beneficiaries, and state-of-the-art technology that serves clients better and faster.
Trust Solutions
Our team offers a vast array of trust solutions, including:
Irrevocable Trusts
This type of living trust cannot be changed or canceled, but the assets are not considered part of your estate, so they are not accessible by creditors. Irrevocable trusts are typically set up to provide tax savings, asset protection or some other benefit.
Revocable Trusts
The terms of a revocable trust can be canceled or changed, and the trust can be terminated at any time. Revocable trusts do not take assets out of your estate, so they are still accessible to creditors. Living trusts such as this avoid probate and do not become a matter of public record.
Charitable Trusts
There are two main types of charitable trusts that can help you support your favorite cause: A charitable remainder trust (CRT) is an irrevocable trust in which you receive income for life. Upon death, the remaining assets are donated to your charity of choice. A charitable lead trust (CLT) is an irrevocable trust that pays an annuity to a charity for a set number of years, then pays the remaining assets to a named beneficiary upon your death. A donor advised fund (DAF) is an additional alternative charitable giving solution but is not considered a trust. For more information, click here.
Life Insurance Trusts
These trusts give ownership of the life insurance policy to the trust, taking it out of your estate. This can help reduce estate taxes and make proceeds available immediately after your passing. The proceeds from life insurance trusts are used to pay taxes, legal fees, probate costs and other liabilities when the person who created the trust dies. After the debts are paid, the trustee distributes the remaining proceeds to the beneficiary.
Special Needs Trusts
Designed to provide financial security and long-term care to a beneficiary with special needs or a disability, a special needs trust preserves the eligibility for needs-based government benefits, so Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid will still be available to the beneficiary.
Delaware Directed Trusts
Delaware is known as a trust-friendly jurisdiction with innovative laws regarding taxes and asset protection. Through our private label partnership with New York Private Trust Company, Raymond James Trust is able to offer this type of trust to nonresidents. For high-net-worth individuals, establishing a Delaware directed trust offers several attractive benefits such as confidentiality, asset protection, substantial tax advantages, simple transfers and modernizations, and liberal investment policies.
Other Specialty Trusts
Raymond James Trust can work with you to come up with the best solution for your unique needs, from generation-skipping trusts and marital-bypass trusts to dynasty trusts and beyond.













Settlement Services


We’re here to help when the dust needs settling


You and your beneficiaries can count on Raymond James Trust to be present every step of the way as arrangements are made and carried out during a complicated, stressful and difficult time. From providing accurate explanations of all estate and court proceedings to preparing final tax returns, we’re here to guide you.




Trust Settlement
Estate Settlement



Trust Settlement

Trust Settlement
If your estate is set up through a trust, Raymond James Trust can help coordinate the settlement after death. We keep detailed records to effectively manage the estate and work with attorneys and accountants to ensure that assets are distributed according to your wishes. This type of settlement is appropriate for those who have set up their estate through trusts, those who cannot or do not want to manage their financial affairs, or those who wish to have assets remain in trust for their family after passing.





Estate Settlement

Estate Settlement
If your estate is set up through a will, Raymond James Trust can help move the settlement through the probate process, coordinating with attorneys and accountants while identifying, collecting, valuing and managing your assets, final taxes and so forth. As personal representative or executor, we will keep detailed records to effectively manage the estate, relieve family members of an overwhelming responsibility and provide superior personal attention to beneficiaries. This type of settlement is appropriate for those who have their estate set up through a will, those who would like the confidence that comes from knowing that their estate is secure and protected from unnecessary settlement costs and taxes, and those who want their heirs to be provided for properly and their estate settled according to their wishes.

Trust Solutions
An irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT) is a trust solution used to remove the ownership and control of a life insurance policy from an estate. Life insurance can be used to fund estate taxes and final expenses upon the death of an individual. The grantor completely gives up all rights in the property transferred to the trust and retains no rights to revoke, terminate or modify the trust in any material way.
When such a trust holds a life insurance policy, usually on the life (lives) of the grantor and/or a spouse, it is an ILIT. If withdrawal powers are given to the beneficiaries, it may also be referred to as a "Crummey trust."
Get started by reviewing the Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust Overview (BB9616) (Temporarily unavailable) for more details.






                Key Features
                 





ILITs are used to accomplish some or all of the following objectives:

Helping meet the liquidity needs of the grantor's estate
Helping provide for the income needs of survivors
Avoid the estate taxation of the life insurance death proceeds
Sheltering property in the trust from creditors at death

Tim Powers joined Wilmington Trust as managing director and head of Trust Administration for its Advisor Solutions Group.


Wilmington Trust hired Timothy M. Powers, CTFA, as managing director and head of Trust Administration for its Advisor Solutions Group. In this role, he will set the fiduciary strategic direction for the Advisor Solutions Group, focusing on best practices and adherence to government regulations. He is based in the Advisor Solutions Group main office located in Wilmington, Del.
 
“Tim’s expertise will help ensure we are approaching our administrative duties in the most efficient and effective manner with the right level of risk oversight,” said John Hurley, group manager of Wilmington Trust’s Advisor Solutions Group. “Having Tim on the team will enable us to further improve our advisor relationships. His insights acquired from working for key industry partners will be invaluable.”
 
The Advisor Solutions Group is dedicated to providing Wilmington Trust products and services to the professional investment advisor market.
 
Powers most recently worked for Morgan Stanley as chief fiduciary officer, where he was responsible for a team of more than 50 trust professionals across seven offices, which included tax and special assets groups. While at Morgan Stanley, he was the lead bank representative with the OCC, as well as internal and external auditors. Previously, Powers was senior trust officer at UBS Trust Company, and before that, he was chief trust officer at Citi Trust.
 
He received a Bachelor of Science in Finance from Rider University. Powers earned the Certified Trust and Financial Advisor designation from the Institute of Certified Bankers. He is an advisory board member for the American Bankers Association’s National and Graduate Trust Schools, and previously was a board member of the Trust and Estate Administration Committee of the New York State Bar Association.
 
Powers is based in the Advisor Solutions Group office located at 2710 Centerville Rd. in Wilmington, Del., and can be reached at (302)636-8511.

You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook.

Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.

Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.

You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.

Inheritance and estate planning is a very complicated legal procedure. Laws vary from state to state, notwithstanding any specific federal tax implications. Having a valid will in place helps to avoid problems typically associated with probate. There are a number of other methods available to minimize the financial obligations you might incur through an inheritance.
If you are seeking legal help regarding financial planning for the future, contact an estate planning lawyer in your area today. An estate is the entirety of a property, real and personal, owned by an individual prior to distribution through a trust or will.
Estate planning is the process by which an individual, or nuclear family with the person's consent and approval, arranges the transfer of assets to heirs or other beneficiaries. The reason for this is to provide the family, or anonymous miscellaneous beneficiaries, with legal rights to the property after the individual has passed away.
Aspects of estate planning include: Trusts, Wills, Uniform Probate Code, Gift Tax, Dynasty Trust and Joint Tenancy
A good estate planning lawyer can do more than just manufacture a simple will. Estate planning also typically minimizes potential taxes and fees, and sets up contingency planning to make sure that your wishes regarding which items are allocated and who the main beneficiaries are.
Many trusts are created as an alternative to or in conjunction with a will and other elements of estate planning. State law establishes the framework for determining the validity and limits for both.
An estate planning lawyer can assist you with organizing your personal and business records such as: Brokerage Accounts, Retirement Plans, Savings and Checking Accounts, Insurance Policies, Business and Partnership Interests and Debt Personal Property. An Estate Planner can also assist all other possible estate planning law concerns.

Inheritance and estate planning is a very complicated legal procedure. Laws vary from state to state, notwithstanding any specific federal tax implications. Having a valid will in place helps to avoid problems typically associated with probate. There are a number of other methods available to minimize the financial obligations you might incur through an inheritance.
If you are seeking legal help regarding financial planning for the future, contact an estate planning lawyer in your area today. An estate is the entirety of a property, real and personal, owned by an individual prior to distribution through a trust or will.
Estate planning is the process by which an individual, or nuclear family with the person's consent and approval, arranges the transfer of assets to heirs or other beneficiaries. The reason for this is to provide the family, or anonymous miscellaneous beneficiaries, with legal rights to the property after the individual has passed away.
Aspects of estate planning include: Trusts, Wills, Uniform Probate Code, Gift Tax, Dynasty Trust and Joint Tenancy
A good estate planning lawyer can do more than just manufacture a simple will. Estate planning also typically minimizes potential taxes and fees, and sets up contingency planning to make sure that your wishes regarding which items are allocated and who the main beneficiaries are.
Many trusts are created as an alternative to or in conjunction with a will and other elements of estate planning. State law establishes the framework for determining the validity and limits for both.
An estate planning lawyer can assist you with organizing your personal and business records such as: Brokerage Accounts, Retirement Plans, Savings and Checking Accounts, Insurance Policies, Business and Partnership Interests and Debt Personal Property. An Estate Planner can also assist all other possible estate planning law concerns.
