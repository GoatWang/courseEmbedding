What kind of investment products does Schwab offer?


                    Our wide selection of investment products provides you with the numerous choices in building a diversified portfolio to help reach your goals.
                  



Investment Product
What it is
Why you may want it




Mutual Funds
A mutual fund is an investment vehicle made up of a pool of funds from many investors that buys stocks, bonds, and other securities.
Mutual funds make it easy to diversify your portfolio and get professional management, so you don’t have to research, buy, and track every security in the fund.


Stocks
A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company, including a claim on the company’s earnings and assets. As such, stockholders are partial owners of the company.
Stocks are fundamental to nearly every portfolio and have historically outperformed most other investments over time (past performance cannot guarantee future results).


ETFs
An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund or portfolio of securities that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities, generally designed to track an index. Unlike mutual funds, which are bought from or redeemed by the fund company for that day’s closing net asset value (NAV), ETFs are bought and sold at market value, trading on an exchange throughout the day.
In addition to adding diversity to your portfolio, ETFs typically have higher daily liquidity and lower fees than mutual fund shares, making them an attractive alternative for individual investors.


Options
An option is a financial derivative that represents a contract sold by one party (the option writer) to another party (the option holder). The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a security or other financial asset at an agreed-upon price (the strike price) until or upon a specific date (expiration date).
Options can provide more-flexible strategies than stocks.


Futures
Futures are financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset or the seller to sell an asset, such as a physical commodity or a financial instrument, at a predetermined future date and price.
Futures can provide a fast and cost-effective way for you to access financial and commodity markets around the clock.


Closed-End Funds
A closed-end fund (CEF), or closed-ended fund, is a pooled investment fund with a portfolio managed by an investment advisor. CEF’s issue a fixed number of shares that trade on an exchange and are not redeemable from the fund. Unlike open-end funds (i.e., mutual funds), new shares in a closed-end fund are not created by managers to meet demand from investors.
Closed-end funds offer investors diversification along with the potential for regular income distributions.


Bonds, CDs, and Other Fixed Income
Fixed income investments are types of investments that seek to provide interest payments at regular intervals.
Fixed income investments can give you a reasonably dependable income stream while also providing portfolio diversification, capital preservation, and (in some cases) potential tax benefits.


Money Market Funds
Money market funds invest in short-term debts that typically have low risk.
Money market funds can offer stability of capital, liquidity, and yield.


Global Investing
Investing in foreign securities.
Global investing can provide more portfolio diversification and has the potential for investment opportunities in emerging markets around the world.




View important information


Investors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. You can request a prospectus by calling 800-435-4000. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
                        


                        Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although certain funds may seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
                        

                        Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. Shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV).
                      
                        Options carry a high level of risk and are not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade options through Schwab. Please read the options disclosure document titled Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options.
                      
                        Futures trading carries a high level of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade futures. Please read the Risk Disclosure Statement for Futures and Options before considering any futures transactions.
                      
                        Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed-income investments are subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.
                      
                        International investments involve additional risks, which include differences in financial accounting standards, currency fluctuations, geopolitical risk, foreign taxes and regulations, and the potential for illiquid markets. Investing in emerging markets may accentuate these risks.

                      1. Unlimited ATM fee rebates apply to cash withdrawals using the Schwab Bank Visa® Platinum debit card (also referred to as a "check card" or "Visa check card") wherever it is accepted. ATM fee rebates do not apply to any fees other than fees assessed for using an ATM to withdraw cash from your Schwab Bank account. Schwab Bank makes its best effort to identify those ATM fees eligible for rebate, based on information it receives from Visa and ATM operators. In the event that you have not received a rebate for a fee that you believe is eligible, please call a Schwab Bank Client Service Specialist for assistance at 888-403-9000. Schwab Bank reserves the right to modify or discontinue the ATM fee rebate at any time.
                      

                      2. Schwab Bank does not assess foreign transaction fees (i.e., a fee to convert US Dollars to local currency) to debit cardholders.
                      

                        3. Funds deposited at Charles Schwab Bank are insured, in aggregate, up to $250,000 based on account ownership type, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
                      

                        Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking accounts are available only as linked accounts with Schwab One® accounts.

True Male Enhancement Supplements Revealed

How You Really Can Achieve Harder, Stronger, Longer-Lasting Erections And Improve Your Sex Drive.


                    
                    

Updated 7:26 PM EST, Mon May 23, 2016.





Tom Stakleff
Senior Researcher
Mens Health and Wellness

                      I’ve probably said this to you before, but I’ll say it again: As the Senior Researcher for Men’s Health and Wellness at Supplement Review Digest, my mission is to empower you with knowledge that will help you find the best natural supplements. I want you to be able to solve your problems and change your life for the better. In regards to us men, that means I have to address some issues that none of us like to talk about—like decreased sex drive, the inability to get and stay hard, and the confusing male enhancement industry.
                
                Millions of men around the world are afflicted by age-related issues that make it difficult to gain and sustain an erection. Most of these men are between the ages of 40 and 80, like me. There are various causes of our pain, but the effects are all the same: we feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed, and sexually frustrated. There’s nothing more emasculating than not being able to perform for our partners. Today, I’m going to help you find REAL solutions that thousands of other men have used to reinvigorate their sex lives.
First, it’s important to understand that it’s not your fault. Don’t be ashamed. The challenge of getting a hard, lasting erection is something that just naturally happens to men of our age group. You haven’t failed your partner unless you do nothing about it—but you’re reading this right now because you WILL do something about it. So, keep your head up. The struggle to stay positive is one of the first hurdles you need to get over to improve your sex life.
The next hurdle is navigating the ludicrous male enhancement market. You’ve seen all the false claims out there. Every company says they have all the answers. You could easily develop a distrust of the entire industry. A quick bit of research on PubMed (or even just Wikipedia or WebMD) will lead you to information about how some herbs really do help with sex drive and erection strength, so there must be some legitimate supplements out there. The struggle is in finding a company has the right combinations of highly-concentrated herbs, backed by research and science, and that other men use again and again because it works.
It’s no wonder I’ve gotten so many emails asking what male enhancement pills I recommend. Some of you are so sick of the malarkey that you’re ready to resort to the “blue pill.” I’m happy to tell you that you don’t have to. You don’t need to suffer from extreme headaches just to get an erection and satisfy your partner.
I’m answering your calls for help today. There ARE effective male enhancement supplements out there, and I’m going to help you find them. You can spend your money on something that is a legitimate investment in yourself and your health. Best of all, you can attain the sexual satisfaction you deserve.
The Science of Erections
You probably already know this by now, but I’m going to rehash it just in case: there are chambers in the penis that fill up with blood to make it erect. The full process is a little bit more complicated than that, but that’s the important part. So, to find an effective supplement, you need to find something that helps the blood fill the chambers and keeps them filled.
There are several factors that can complicate this process. Some of the factors are mental (depression, stress, anxiety), some are physical (circulation, hormones, diabetes). A good supplement will address these factors and counteract any effect they might be having on your sex drive.

How to Spot a Scam
               These are my top 5 red flags I use to avoid throwing money away:
            
             1. PRESCRIPTION STRENGTH. This might be obvious, but be mindful of any herbal supplement that exaggerates its effectiveness. If a company is trying to tell you that their supplement can run side-by-side with a prescription drug, immediately look to its ingredients and user reviews and let common sense be your guide.
            


2. FREE TRIAL. When a company offers to give you a free product and asks you to just pay for shipping, they enter you into a subscription as soon as you give them your credit card info. The subscription becomes nearly impossible to cancel. So, whether the product works or not, you’re stuck paying for it again and again.

       
          3. THE PRODUCT PROMISES TO ADD INCHES TO YOUR MEMBER. As I mentioned before, every penis has chambers that fill up with blood during an erection. Those chambers determine the size of an erect penis. Aside from surgery, there is no way to change the size of those chambers. There is no magic pill that permanently adds inches and girth. Some supplements will claim to “maximize size.” That’s different——that just means they promise their pill will help fully fill the existing chambers.
          
       4. IF THE WEBSITE LOOKS AMATEUR. This one is probably obvious. If the site has simple coding errors where buttons don’t line up or if there are obvious misspellings all over, be warned. If a company can’t afford to hire a decent web designer, how can they afford to develop an effective supplement?
       
         5. IF IT’S NOT MADE IN AMERICA. Foreign-made products are not subject to FDA scrutiny and might be full of ingredients that are completely worthless, or are rendered worthless by sitting in shipping crates on container ships for months at a time. Some of these supplements may do more harm than good.
          
       

How to Spot a Life-Changer
There are multiple ways to identify a good product. I reveal my full process in identifying good products later in this article. For now, here’s a general rule: Rather than look at the ingredients in the product, look at the research behind the ingredients. Don’t trust a company that doesn’t do its homework, or that won’t show it to you. A credible company will share their research with you. You know they’re confident in their product if they demonstrate that they have nothing to hide. They will be able to show you exactly how the ingredients in their product will get you these results:

  
Harder, Longer-Lasting Erections 
Improved Sex Drive 
Maximized Size 
Boosted Mood & Confidence 
Satisfied Partners 
More Intimate Love Life 
Sexual Satisfaction 



How We Rated Our Winners
Now that I have helped you avoid the time and money wasters, it’s time to fill you in on how MY search for effective supplements went. The male enhancement market is HUGE. My research team and I sorted through hundreds of the supplements out there. I’m ready to help you find the good ones.
At Supplement Review Digest, we’ve shopped around and seen it all so that you don’t have to. We’ve selected the Top 3 male enhancement supplements that I believe are actually worth your money.
These brands were selected based on the research, safety, and effectiveness of their chosen ingredients, consistently high customer reviews, and how well they performed in our in-house double-blind trials against placebos. 
My team had two groups take pills for 4 months (one group took a product, the other a placebo) and report back to us weekly with their results. Our male enhancement groups had individuals who reported improvements in ability to get and maintain erections. The placebo groups reported no gains. 
We ranked the products by which group had the highest number of erection-achieving men at the end of the trial period and by these 10 factors:


1. Customer Reviews
2. Purity of Ingredients
3. Are FDA Guidelines Followed


4. Research & Scientific Evidence
5. Speed of Expected Result
6. Customer Service


7. Types of Ingredients in Formula
8. Price
9. Return Policy

If you ever wanted to give any male enhancement a try, this is the one we recommend to go with.
Experiment Results: 17 out of 20 men reported erection improvements over 4 months. 85%+ Success Rate.
Overview: ASOX9 was created by a researcher, and Harvard biology graduate who created the formula to help boost his own sexual performance. He spent years researching different formulas in order to undertand why many products didn't work for him, and ended up creating his own formula.  It's our top pick for the best male enhancement supplement of 2016. 

Users claim to have stronger and larger erections than ever before. Many of the users over 50 also report having an increased sex drive at an all time high and a better performance in the bedroom.

Older men say that they feel like  they are in their early 20s after an average of 1 to 3 weeks of use.

Some users report having tried many different supplements and ASOX9 to be the only one to get them completely hard and actually work for them.
Do we recomemnd it? Absolutely, it is one of the few products that users claim actually works and there is good reason for it... The Formula.

So give it a try for yourself and let us know what you think by emailing me at david.g@supplementreviewdigest.com

			      ASOX9 contains high amounts of Tong Kat Ali, Arginine, Maca, along with Oyster and Orchic Extract making it very unique. Click the learn more button to read the detailed review. Learn More or Order Here

High T Black is the newest product from the King Fisher Company. According to their website, it improves sex drive and libido, strength and stamina, energy and vitality, and nitric oxide and muscle mass. 
Experiment Results: 14 out of 20 men reported erection improvements over 4 months. ~70% Success Rate.
                   Overview: Most users report having positive results but not as good as the claims on King Fishers website. They say that it works best if taken for 2 weeks straight or longer. 
Most mentioned benefit that we found from users was energy. The product contains 200mg of caffeine (about 2 cups of coffee) per serving.  The downside to this is if you are sensitive to caffeine, this is not a good choice for you. Also, the added caffeine could is bit dangerous for the heart. Thus, anyone with heart issues should check with their doctor prior to use.
The main ingredients include Fenugreek, Eurycoma Longfolia Extra, Rhodiola Rosea Extract, and Arginine-Arginine Alphaketoglutarate. For best results, the company recommends to taking 4 capsules per daily with water along with following a exercise routine.
It is our number 2 choice. To read the full review just click to Learn More.

Steel Libido Red from Irvin Naturals has been on the market for a few years now. It’s a follow up formula to their original Steel Libido product. You can still buy the original formula however, we found that most customers prefer the new “Red” formula.
Experiment Results: 14 out of 20 men reported erection improvements over 4 months achieved the "same results as the number 2 choice in our trial, but when we had a staff member call their customer support pretending to be a dissatisfied customer, we were unimpressed with their service, so we used that as the tie-breaker.” ~70% Success Rate.

              Overview: Main ingredients in Steel Libido Red include L-Citrulline, Velvet Bean Extract, Ginseng, Ginkgo Balboa and Theobromine.  Most of the customer reviews we found online were positive. 
Irvin Natural’s a trusted brand and has been a staple for many men. It has positive feedback from users but not as strong as some of the other products on our list.
For best results, its recommended to take 4 softgels 60 minutes before sexual activity. The is 18.75 serving per bottle.
It is our number 3 choice. To read the full review just click Learn More.

Supplement Review Digest does not often review products in the male enhancement category, but since we have received a ton of requests from men wanting our opinion on what is the most effectively male enhancement supplement on the market today, we decided to investigate and find out if these pills really live up to their claims.





(Shopping for male enhancement products can be downright difficult)


Improving bedroom performance is one of those things that every male looks for, especially if it can be done safely and without any side effects. As you get into your 40’s, the general work/life related stress levels rise, and it is natural for your libido to slow and firmness to go, in fact the national health research indicates erectile dysfunction happens to over 78% of males over 40. What this means for you is that about 8 out of 10 of your male friends over 40 are also experiencing this.                    
It is not  surprising that millions of men are turning to natural Male Enhancement for a solution. According to McKinney and Co.  Male Enhancement Industry is valued at $1.3 billion, and is projected to grow 5 or 6 percent a year through 2017.
But what we found was even with so many men purchasing these male enhancement again and again, there are a ton of reviews from disappointed customers that can be found all over the web. If there is one thing we don’t like, it's companies taking advantage of this trend by selling low grade, and  effective ED supplements.                    
As it turns out, many brands use their existing reputation and marketing-budgets to sell you medium quality products. Even worse, some put dangerous fillers such as Hydrogenated Oils and Titanium Dioxide. On the other hand some companies honestly do try to provide good quality products by using highest quality ingrediants with the same dosages as were used in human studies.
At first it may seem counterintuitive that  big brands would sell a low quality product, or that a product would be on the market without result tests, but since these are “Natural Extracts” these companies are not legally required to research results. 
The good part is We Did the reseach for you! You, our readers Identified the bellow as the most important benefits:
              1. You want to Get A Firmer Erection
2. Last Longer
3. and Increase your size

High T Black is the newest product from the King Fisher Company. According to their website, it improves sex drive and libido, strength and stamina, energy and vitality, and nitric oxide and muscle mass. 

Most users report having positive results but not as good as the claims on King Fishers website. They say that it works best if taken for 2 weeks straight or longer. 
Most mentioned benefit that we found from users was energy. The product contains 200mg of caffeine (about 2 cups of coffee) per serving.  The downside to this is if you are sensitive to caffeine, this is not a good choice for you. Also, the added caffeine could is bit dangerous for the heart. Thus, anyone with heart issues should check with their doctor prior to use.
The main ingredients include Fenugreek, Eurycoma Longfolia Extra, Rhodiola Rosea Extract, and Arginine-Arginine Alphaketoglutarate. For best results, the company recommends to taking 4 capsules per daily with water along with following a exercise routine.

If you ever wanted to give any male enhancement a try, this is the one we recommend to go with.

ASOX9 was created by a researcher, and Harvard biology graduate who created the formula to help boost his own sexual performance. He spent years researching different formulas in order to undertand why many products didn't work for him, and ended up creating his own formula.  It's our top pick for the best male enhancement supplement of 2015. 

Users claim to have stronger and larger erections than ever before. Many of the users over 50 also report having an increased sex drive at an all time high and a better performance in the bedroom.

Older men say that they feel like  they are in their early 20s after an average of 1 to 3 weeks of use.

Some users report having tried many different supplements and ASOX9 to be the only one to get them completely hard and actually work for them.
Do we recomemnd it? Absolutely, it is one of the few products that users claim actually works and there is good reason for it... The Formula.

So give it a try for yourself and let us know what you think by emailing me at david.g@supplementreviewdigest.com

			      ASOX9 contains high amounts of Tong Kat Ali, Arginine, Maca, along with Oyster and Orchic Extract making it very unique. Click the learn more button to read the detailed review. Learn More or Order Here

High T Black is the newest product from the King Fisher Company. According to their website, it improves sex drive and libido, strength and stamina, energy and vitality, and nitric oxide and muscle mass. 

Most users report having positive results but not as good as the claims on King Fishers website. They say that it works best if taken for 2 weeks straight or longer. 
Most mentioned benefit that we found from users was energy. The product contains 200mg of caffeine (about 2 cups of coffee) per serving.  The downside to this is if you are sensitive to caffeine, this is not a good choice for you. Also, the added caffeine could is bit dangerous for the heart. Thus, anyone with heart issues should check with their doctor prior to use.
The main ingredients include Fenugreek, Eurycoma Longfolia Extra, Rhodiola Rosea Extract, and Arginine-Arginine Alphaketoglutarate. For best results, the company recommends to taking 4 capsules per daily with water along with following a exercise routine.
It is our number 2 choice. To read the full review just click to Learn More.

Ed Zschau


"I had an awful lot to learn about business . . . I had the conglomerate mentality -- the view that, if you just build one product for one market, you weren't going to be too successful. After I got into five different businesses and almost went bankrupt several times, I learned that you have to focus on something."






By Tom Richman

Eventually Ed Zschau wants to run a diner in some college town, where he can serve up greasy hamburgers and talk philosophy with hirsute students. What is more likely, however, is that he will own the diner, maybe a whole chain of them, or that he will be teaching philosophy at the college, probably as head of the department. Zschau is a person -- we all know one or two of them -- whose biggest problem seems to be coping with an excess of success.It is, in fact, a problem that has dogged him since his college days at Princeton University, where he managed to earn a degree with not one, but three undergraduate majors -- math, physics, and philosophy. He went to Stanford University to study business and got not only an MBA, but also a PhD. When he taught, it was at the graduate business schools at both Harvard University and Stanford. And, when he started his owr business, System Industries Inc., it soon became America's largest independent supplier of minicomputer memory systems. Last year, he won a California congressional seat in his first run for political office. He is young (43) and good-looking.If he weren't so pleasant, Ed Zschau would be easy to dislike. Instead, he seems to win new admirers wherever he goes. According to Rep. James Leach of Iowa -- a fellow Republican and Princeton alumnus -- Ed Zschau is "the star of our freshman class." His constituents, too, give his sometimes maverick views a respect seldom accorded neophyte politicians."I'm one who's trying to throw cold water on the idea that high technology is the answer to all the country's problems," he tells a group of Silicon Valley executives, who nod their agreement."Of course government has a role to play in business," he tells some hard-nosed businessmen, who show no sign of wanting to argue.The 1981 personal income tax cuts were a "big mistake," and Social Security payments should not be fully indexed to inflation, he says one evening before a town meeting of district voters prosperous enough to be paying income taxes and old enough to be drawing Social Security checks. None of them flinches.Zschau may not be the only business-person, or even the only entrepreneur, in the U.S. House of Representatives, but he is hardly typical in a body dominated by lawyers and former state legislators. The founder and former chief executive officer of a highly successful high-tech company, he represents a congressional district -- California's 12th, which includes Santa Clara Valley -- with more technology-based companies and entrepreneurs than any other district in the country. To breast-beating, free-market Republicans and to Democrats who would turn the country's economic future over to a government planning board alike, he can say that he has lived in that part of the real world and that it doesn't work the way either one of them wishes it did.Oddly enough, Zschau had no intention of becoming either a businessman or a politician when he started out. A Nebraskan by birth and a scholar by training, he appeared destined for a career in academe. After earning his PhD in business from Stanford in 1967, he taught for a year at Harvard Business School, then returned to Palo Alto, fully expecting to continue his studies. "Another professor and I were asked to head up the business-policy program at Stanford," he recalls, "which deals with strategic planning and how to be a CEO. We got started and, frankly, I guess I felt a need to get into business myself, to see whether I could run a business and how it all worked."The particular business that I decided to start was sort of an accident. I ran into a friend who had recently started a company in the scientific instrument business, and his firm needed a computer system to automate the instrument. So that was the first product that my company developed. It wasn't a very successful product, but successful enough to get us going."I had an awful lot to learn. For example, I learned about focus. When I was studying for my MBA and PhD, a lot of business professors and business leaders were enamored of the concept of conglomerates. I had a lot of that mentality -- the view that, if you just build one product for one market, you weren't going to be too successful. After I got into five different businesses and almost went bankrupt several times, I learned that you have to focus on something -- a product or a product line and a market -- and devote all of your attention to that. One by one, we began to sell [product lines] off, and the one business that a lot of people thought would never survive -- the storage systems business -- is now running at a $100 million [annual sales] rate."As an entrepreneur, Zschau gave little thought to politics, but in 1977 he agreed to head a task force of the American Electronics Association that was seeking a reduction in the maximum capital-gains tax rate from 50% to 28%. Working with other organizations, he lobbied the legislation through Congress over the strong opposition of then-President Jimmy Carter, who wanted the tax rate increased."Having seen the impact that people who understood the issue could have on the legislative process," Zschau relates, "I got more interested in politics. When [Congressman] Pete McCloskey decided to run for the Senate, leaving his seat open, I thought about what I would do, and decided that I had a contribution to make. [The company] was reaching $70 million or $80 million in sales, about the right time to transfer to professional management from the raw entrepreneur. Everything just fell into place."Zschau turned out to be a first-rate campaigner, and he still maintains a campaign pace when he is in his district. One day last August, for example, he managed a lunchtime address to the Electronics Association of California in Santa Clara, a field hearing of a House subcommittee in Berkeley, and a meeting with constituents in Menlo Park.The electronics executives greeted him as one of their own, and Zschau spoke to them out of shared experience, telling stories about his own company. "The thing about my venture capitalists was that, although their pockets might have been deep, their arms were real short," he quipped. " . . . I used to have this professor who said that you couldn't know what it was to be in business until you'd met a payroll. I say you don't know what it's like to be in small business until you've missed one." One diner confided to his tablemate that Zschau is "somebody who understands business and can't be snowed."Then again, he is wise enough to admit the limits of his knowledge. "I don't know," he said to a questioner at a meeting that same evening. "You may be right. I hadn't thought of it that way. Perhaps I should." He applies the same rule to politics that he learned in business: Concentrate in areas in which you have strength. "You earn [influence]," he says, "by developing a reputation for being thoughtful and well informed on certain issues and for speaking only when you have something to say."Most of what Zschau has said since entering the House this year relates to the federal government's role in influencing -- for better or for worse -- industry's ability to compete in international markets and at home.His premise is simple: America's strong suit is innovation, the creation of new technologies, products, services, and companies. Consequently, the best thing government can do is to promote an environment that encourages innovation. Instead of picking industrial winners and losers and targeting them for special help (as many have suggested), the government must "target the innovation process" itself. What he means by this is that innovation -- whether in high technology or in basic industries -- occurs when certain conditions exist; namely, when there are educated people working with a sound research base in a healthy economy providing incentives to risk-takers. The federal government, he says, should work to foster these conditions He believes, for example, that government has primary responsibility for the funding of basic (as opposed to applied) research at universities. He also believes that industry would perform more of its own research if antitrust laws did not dampen enthusiasm for joint research efforts. In addition, the federal government can use tax incentives to encourage private-sector assistance in funding education that benefits specific industries.Tax policy can likewise affect the willingness of individuals and companies to take risks, he says. "Democrats complain that rich people shouldn't get tax breaks. But when you eliminate tax breaks, you dry up risk capital. There should be a preception that the tax system is fair, but when someone who has nothing creates something, we shouldn't say that's wrong. They've created wealth, jobs. We ought to be telling these people, 'Good going. Attaboy."On the other hand, Zschau has long opposed across-the-board individual income tax cuts, including those of 1981, which he predicted would be a factor in increasing the federal deficit, thereby making it harder to bring interest rates down and hindering investment. "I continue to believe that," he asserts. On the spending side, he argues for "a social compact, in which all the special interests agree that reducing the deficit will benefit them more than their special program."All of which may sound a little too neat and tidy, but"I don't purport to have the whole answer," Zschau admits. "My industrial-policy suggestions so far have focused on maintaining our technological leadership and -- an extension of that -- [making] our tired industries more competitive through the application of technology- But I don't purport to have solutions to any transitional problems that may arise... I'm not sure I understand, or anyone understands, how severe they are or what their causes are."... I have a fairly narrow range of experience. I've been in the high-tech industry, and I think that, by and large, the business attitudes in that industry are unique. People there are rugged individualists, very much dedicated to free enterprise, free trade, risk-taking. It's a breed of businessman that is a fine example of capitalism at work. I've gotten a very positive view of the social responsibilities of business and where jobs are created and what kinds of [management] attitudes work. Had I been employed in some monolith headquartered in New York City, I may have gotten a somewhat different view of the way business works. Mine was sort of a small-company, entrepreneurial perspective."Zschau insists that, as usual, he has given little thought to his future. "That's been my approach all along... As time goes on, other opportunities arise, and I find myself in the shower in the morning, thinking more about the new thing than the old thing. When that begins to occur more frequently, I tell myself it's time to make a change. I'm no longer 100% intrigued by what I'm doing. It would be better for someone else to do that job, and I'll move along to something that's really sparked my interest."

Five Traits of Startup Product Leaders – Ed Zschau – MediumHomepageSign in / Sign upEd ZschauBlockedUnblockFollowFollowingRetained search for product and marketing execs at Inductus Associates.   Father of two, NBA Warriors fan.Jun 25, 2014Five Traits of Startup Product LeadersProduct leaders come in all flavors. Startups succeed by shipping great products and great products come from having the right person leading the product. In a startup, the product leader is often a company founder — the CEO, a founding VP Product, the CTO or a mix of co-founders.The product leader shapes the norms and priorities on product in these formative stages. How the company thinks about product, how product is discussed internally, how user feedback is acquired and processed, what quantifiable data is obtained and weighed, and, how product decisions are made are all directed by the person leading product.As the company changes and grows, the product leadership needs to evolve. Sometimes, the individual leading product adapts, and sometimes, a new leader needs to take over. The successful startup has someone who can adapt her product leadership to match the company’s needs; or the successful startup is able to make the personnel change with minimal impact on building the product.In recruiting product leaders for venture backed startups, I’ve learned that good Product Leaders possess five characteristics that I’ll describe as The Innovator, The Executioner, The Influencer, The Analyzer and The Business Owner. A Product Leader is not singularly one of these types, but a collection of all five where one or two traits may be stronger than the others.The Innovator — She is creative and visionary. She listens intently and frequently to user needs but sees the product used in ways beyond how users behave and the needs they describe. She loves discussing ideas, holding brainstorming sessions with employees and customers, and is constantly thinking about ways to evolve the product. She constantly asks questions, tests concepts and gathers data (and opinions) from customers, analysts and experts on product ideas. She spends a lot of time talking to customers about solving their needs but also pays attention to market trends, technology developments, competitor products and other queues for inspiration.“The Innovator sets a compelling product vision and constantly evaluates ideas against that vision.”The Executioner — She drives outcomes and results. She pays close attention to details. She’s motivated by achieving goals, meeting deadlines and hitting milestones. She applies process to guide the team’s execution, but does not over apply it. She rigorously applies product development methods like iterative design, Agile, SCRUM and Lean Startup concepts to build product. She build respect with her team and with Engineering by meeting expectations, being accountable, and staying focused and organized. She studies best-practice product management methods and applies them as appropriate in developing the product.“The Executioner sets the goals, timetables, practices and expectations to drive the company to a shipped product.”The Influencer — She is a gifted listener, communicator, negotiator and relationship builder. She knows the product stakeholders: understands their motivations, goals, resources and constraints. She takes into account her stakeholders’ needs but also knows how to acquire their commitment and resources to move the product forward. She comes to product decisions through direct give-and-take feedback, and sets product direction through gaining buy off and commitments from her product and design teams and from key players throughout the company. She is skilled to involve the product team, key functional stakeholders, customers, partners and industry influencers in the product creation process.“The Influencer marshals the resources and aligns the company towards a main product direction.”The Analyzer — She relies heavily on user information, research and data to make product decisions. She sets metrics and measures product performance based upon customer behavior. She applies analytical frameworks and tools — like A/B testing, cohort analysis — to draw insights from the customer data. She is a big believer in usability testing and collaborates with Design and Engineering to test, measure and evaluate new features. She pays close attention to the tradeoffs and dependencies among functionality, user experience and technology capability and coaches his product team to do the same.“The Analyzer applies the right metrics and interprets the data to make good product choices.”The Business Owner — She thinks of product as a business. She knows the company’s business and financial goals intimately and aligns her product objectives to them. She builds the business case for the product, quantifies risk factors and calculates the financial outcomes for building the product. She is crack at financial analysis and incorporates financial metrics (e.g., CPA, LCV, ARPU) to make product decisions and evaluate product performance. She tests business models, sizes markets, builds pricing scenarios, calculates margins, determines capital requirements and builds bottoms-up budget plans. She studies her competitors incessantly and strives to beat competitors to win the market.“The Business Owner evaluates the financial opportunity and required investment to build, launch and market the product.”A great Product Leader recognizes her one or two strong traits and either works to build up those traits or hires people who are already strong in those areas. It’s the CEO job to ensure that the individual leading product shows up every day exhibiting these traits to build the company’s product.Thanks to Will Aldrich (@waldrich), Gary Swart (@garyswart) and Andy Chen (@andychen) for commenting on earlier versions of this post.Share15Never miss a story from Ed Zschau, when you sign up for Medium.

What kind of investment products does Schwab offer?


                    Our wide selection of investment products provides you with the numerous choices in building a diversified portfolio to help reach your goals.
                  



Investment Product
What it is
Why you may want it




Mutual Funds
A mutual fund is an investment vehicle made up of a pool of funds from many investors that buys stocks, bonds, and other securities.
Mutual funds make it easy to diversify your portfolio and get professional management, so you don’t have to research, buy, and track every security in the fund.


Stocks
A stock represents a share in the ownership of a company, including a claim on the company’s earnings and assets. As such, stockholders are partial owners of the company.
Stocks are fundamental to nearly every portfolio and have historically outperformed most other investments over time (past performance cannot guarantee future results).


ETFs
An ETF, or exchange-traded fund, is an investment fund or portfolio of securities that holds assets like stocks, bonds, or commodities, generally designed to track an index. Unlike mutual funds, which are bought from or redeemed by the fund company for that day’s closing net asset value (NAV), ETFs are bought and sold at market value, trading on an exchange throughout the day.
In addition to adding diversity to your portfolio, ETFs typically have higher daily liquidity and lower fees than mutual fund shares, making them an attractive alternative for individual investors.


Options
An option is a financial derivative that represents a contract sold by one party (the option writer) to another party (the option holder). The contract offers the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (call) or sell (put) a security or other financial asset at an agreed-upon price (the strike price) until or upon a specific date (expiration date).
Options can provide more-flexible strategies than stocks.


Futures
Futures are financial contracts obligating the buyer to purchase an asset or the seller to sell an asset, such as a physical commodity or a financial instrument, at a predetermined future date and price.
Futures can provide a fast and cost-effective way for you to access financial and commodity markets around the clock.


Closed-End Funds
A closed-end fund (CEF), or closed-ended fund, is a pooled investment fund with a portfolio managed by an investment advisor. CEF’s issue a fixed number of shares that trade on an exchange and are not redeemable from the fund. Unlike open-end funds (i.e., mutual funds), new shares in a closed-end fund are not created by managers to meet demand from investors.
Closed-end funds offer investors diversification along with the potential for regular income distributions.


Bonds, CDs, and Other Fixed Income
Fixed income investments are types of investments that seek to provide interest payments at regular intervals.
Fixed income investments can give you a reasonably dependable income stream while also providing portfolio diversification, capital preservation, and (in some cases) potential tax benefits.


Money Market Funds
Money market funds invest in short-term debts that typically have low risk.
Money market funds can offer stability of capital, liquidity, and yield.


Global Investing
Investing in foreign securities.
Global investing can provide more portfolio diversification and has the potential for investment opportunities in emerging markets around the world.




View important information


Investors should consider carefully information contained in the prospectus, including investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. You can request a prospectus by calling 800-435-4000. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.
                        


                        Money market funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although certain funds may seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
                        

                        Investment returns will fluctuate and are subject to market volatility, so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed or sold, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Unlike mutual funds, shares of ETFs are not individually redeemable directly with the ETF. Shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than the net asset value (NAV).
                      
                        Options carry a high level of risk and are not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade options through Schwab. Please read the options disclosure document titled Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options.
                      
                        Futures trading carries a high level of risk and is not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade futures. Please read the Risk Disclosure Statement for Futures and Options before considering any futures transactions.
                      
                        Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates. Fixed-income investments are subject to various other risks including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption, corporate events, tax ramifications and other factors.
                      
                        International investments involve additional risks, which include differences in financial accounting standards, currency fluctuations, geopolitical risk, foreign taxes and regulations, and the potential for illiquid markets. Investing in emerging markets may accentuate these risks.

                      1. Unlimited ATM fee rebates apply to cash withdrawals using the Schwab Bank Visa® Platinum debit card (also referred to as a "check card" or "Visa check card") wherever it is accepted. ATM fee rebates do not apply to any fees other than fees assessed for using an ATM to withdraw cash from your Schwab Bank account. Schwab Bank makes its best effort to identify those ATM fees eligible for rebate, based on information it receives from Visa and ATM operators. In the event that you have not received a rebate for a fee that you believe is eligible, please call a Schwab Bank Client Service Specialist for assistance at 888-403-9000. Schwab Bank reserves the right to modify or discontinue the ATM fee rebate at any time.
                      

                      2. Schwab Bank does not assess foreign transaction fees (i.e., a fee to convert US Dollars to local currency) to debit cardholders.
                      

                        3. Funds deposited at Charles Schwab Bank are insured, in aggregate, up to $250,000 based on account ownership type, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
                      

                        Schwab Bank High Yield Investor Checking accounts are available only as linked accounts with Schwab One® accounts.

True Male Enhancement Supplements Revealed

How You Really Can Achieve Harder, Stronger, Longer-Lasting Erections And Improve Your Sex Drive.


                    
                    

Updated 7:26 PM EST, Mon May 23, 2016.





Tom Stakleff
Senior Researcher
Mens Health and Wellness

                      I’ve probably said this to you before, but I’ll say it again: As the Senior Researcher for Men’s Health and Wellness at Supplement Review Digest, my mission is to empower you with knowledge that will help you find the best natural supplements. I want you to be able to solve your problems and change your life for the better. In regards to us men, that means I have to address some issues that none of us like to talk about—like decreased sex drive, the inability to get and stay hard, and the confusing male enhancement industry.
                
                Millions of men around the world are afflicted by age-related issues that make it difficult to gain and sustain an erection. Most of these men are between the ages of 40 and 80, like me. There are various causes of our pain, but the effects are all the same: we feel guilty, ashamed, embarrassed, and sexually frustrated. There’s nothing more emasculating than not being able to perform for our partners. Today, I’m going to help you find REAL solutions that thousands of other men have used to reinvigorate their sex lives.
First, it’s important to understand that it’s not your fault. Don’t be ashamed. The challenge of getting a hard, lasting erection is something that just naturally happens to men of our age group. You haven’t failed your partner unless you do nothing about it—but you’re reading this right now because you WILL do something about it. So, keep your head up. The struggle to stay positive is one of the first hurdles you need to get over to improve your sex life.
The next hurdle is navigating the ludicrous male enhancement market. You’ve seen all the false claims out there. Every company says they have all the answers. You could easily develop a distrust of the entire industry. A quick bit of research on PubMed (or even just Wikipedia or WebMD) will lead you to information about how some herbs really do help with sex drive and erection strength, so there must be some legitimate supplements out there. The struggle is in finding a company has the right combinations of highly-concentrated herbs, backed by research and science, and that other men use again and again because it works.
It’s no wonder I’ve gotten so many emails asking what male enhancement pills I recommend. Some of you are so sick of the malarkey that you’re ready to resort to the “blue pill.” I’m happy to tell you that you don’t have to. You don’t need to suffer from extreme headaches just to get an erection and satisfy your partner.
I’m answering your calls for help today. There ARE effective male enhancement supplements out there, and I’m going to help you find them. You can spend your money on something that is a legitimate investment in yourself and your health. Best of all, you can attain the sexual satisfaction you deserve.
The Science of Erections
You probably already know this by now, but I’m going to rehash it just in case: there are chambers in the penis that fill up with blood to make it erect. The full process is a little bit more complicated than that, but that’s the important part. So, to find an effective supplement, you need to find something that helps the blood fill the chambers and keeps them filled.
There are several factors that can complicate this process. Some of the factors are mental (depression, stress, anxiety), some are physical (circulation, hormones, diabetes). A good supplement will address these factors and counteract any effect they might be having on your sex drive.

How to Spot a Scam
               These are my top 5 red flags I use to avoid throwing money away:
            
             1. PRESCRIPTION STRENGTH. This might be obvious, but be mindful of any herbal supplement that exaggerates its effectiveness. If a company is trying to tell you that their supplement can run side-by-side with a prescription drug, immediately look to its ingredients and user reviews and let common sense be your guide.
            


2. FREE TRIAL. When a company offers to give you a free product and asks you to just pay for shipping, they enter you into a subscription as soon as you give them your credit card info. The subscription becomes nearly impossible to cancel. So, whether the product works or not, you’re stuck paying for it again and again.

       
          3. THE PRODUCT PROMISES TO ADD INCHES TO YOUR MEMBER. As I mentioned before, every penis has chambers that fill up with blood during an erection. Those chambers determine the size of an erect penis. Aside from surgery, there is no way to change the size of those chambers. There is no magic pill that permanently adds inches and girth. Some supplements will claim to “maximize size.” That’s different——that just means they promise their pill will help fully fill the existing chambers.
          
       4. IF THE WEBSITE LOOKS AMATEUR. This one is probably obvious. If the site has simple coding errors where buttons don’t line up or if there are obvious misspellings all over, be warned. If a company can’t afford to hire a decent web designer, how can they afford to develop an effective supplement?
       
         5. IF IT’S NOT MADE IN AMERICA. Foreign-made products are not subject to FDA scrutiny and might be full of ingredients that are completely worthless, or are rendered worthless by sitting in shipping crates on container ships for months at a time. Some of these supplements may do more harm than good.
          
       

How to Spot a Life-Changer
There are multiple ways to identify a good product. I reveal my full process in identifying good products later in this article. For now, here’s a general rule: Rather than look at the ingredients in the product, look at the research behind the ingredients. Don’t trust a company that doesn’t do its homework, or that won’t show it to you. A credible company will share their research with you. You know they’re confident in their product if they demonstrate that they have nothing to hide. They will be able to show you exactly how the ingredients in their product will get you these results:

  
Harder, Longer-Lasting Erections 
Improved Sex Drive 
Maximized Size 
Boosted Mood & Confidence 
Satisfied Partners 
More Intimate Love Life 
Sexual Satisfaction 



How We Rated Our Winners
Now that I have helped you avoid the time and money wasters, it’s time to fill you in on how MY search for effective supplements went. The male enhancement market is HUGE. My research team and I sorted through hundreds of the supplements out there. I’m ready to help you find the good ones.
At Supplement Review Digest, we’ve shopped around and seen it all so that you don’t have to. We’ve selected the Top 3 male enhancement supplements that I believe are actually worth your money.
These brands were selected based on the research, safety, and effectiveness of their chosen ingredients, consistently high customer reviews, and how well they performed in our in-house double-blind trials against placebos. 
My team had two groups take pills for 4 months (one group took a product, the other a placebo) and report back to us weekly with their results. Our male enhancement groups had individuals who reported improvements in ability to get and maintain erections. The placebo groups reported no gains. 
We ranked the products by which group had the highest number of erection-achieving men at the end of the trial period and by these 10 factors:


1. Customer Reviews
2. Purity of Ingredients
3. Are FDA Guidelines Followed


4. Research & Scientific Evidence
5. Speed of Expected Result
6. Customer Service


7. Types of Ingredients in Formula
8. Price
9. Return Policy

Experiment Results: 14 out of 20 men reported erection improvements over 4 months. ~70% Success Rate.

Steel Libido Red from Irvin Naturals has been on the market for a few years now. It’s a follow up formula to their original Steel Libido product. You can still buy the original formula however, we found that most customers prefer the new “Red” formula.
Experiment Results: 14 out of 20 men reported erection improvements over 4 months achieved the "same results as the number 2 choice in our trial, but when we had a staff member call their customer support pretending to be a dissatisfied customer, we were unimpressed with their service, so we used that as the tie-breaker.” ~70% Success Rate.

              Overview: Main ingredients in Steel Libido Red include L-Citrulline, Velvet Bean Extract, Ginseng, Ginkgo Balboa and Theobromine.  Most of the customer reviews we found online were positive. 
Irvin Natural’s a trusted brand and has been a staple for many men. It has positive feedback from users but not as strong as some of the other products on our list.
For best results, its recommended to take 4 softgels 60 minutes before sexual activity. The is 18.75 serving per bottle.
It is our number 3 choice. To read the full review just click Learn More.

Male Enhancement Buyer’s Guide
for March 2015

How To Choose An ED Supplement, That Effectively Increases Men’s Sex Drive, Erection Size,  Erection Hardness and Erection Strength.
                    
March 23, 2014
Supplement Review Digest does not often review products in the male enhancement category, but since we have received a ton of requests from men wanting our opinion on what is the most effectively male enhancement supplement on the market today, we decided to investigate and find out if these pills really live up to their claims.





(Shopping for male enhancement products can be downright difficult)


Improving bedroom performance is one of those things that every male looks for, especially if it can be done safely and without any side effects. As you get into your 40’s, the general work/life related stress levels rise, and it is natural for your libido to slow and firmness to go, in fact the national health research indicates erectile dysfunction happens to over 78% of males over 40. What this means for you is that about 8 out of 10 of your male friends over 40 are also experiencing this.                    
It is not  surprising that millions of men are turning to natural Male Enhancement for a solution. According to McKinney and Co.  Male Enhancement Industry is valued at $1.3 billion, and is projected to grow 5 or 6 percent a year through 2017.
But what we found was even with so many men purchasing these male enhancement again and again, there are a ton of reviews from disappointed customers that can be found all over the web. If there is one thing we don’t like, it's companies taking advantage of this trend by selling low grade, and  effective ED supplements.                    
As it turns out, many brands use their existing reputation and marketing-budgets to sell you medium quality products. Even worse, some put dangerous fillers such as Hydrogenated Oils and Titanium Dioxide. On the other hand some companies honestly do try to provide good quality products by using highest quality ingrediants with the same dosages as were used in human studies.
At first it may seem counterintuitive that  big brands would sell a low quality product, or that a product would be on the market without result tests, but since these are “Natural Extracts” these companies are not legally required to research results. 
The good part is We Did the reseach for you! You, our readers Identified the bellow as the most important benefits:
              1. You want to Get A Firmer Erection
2. Last Longer
3. and Increase your size
                    
                    We’ve researched the Top Erectile Dysfunction and male enhancement supplements available, and identified the top 3  products tht users said have helped them achieve these results:

High T Black is the newest product from the King Fisher Company. According to their website, it improves sex drive and libido, strength and stamina, energy and vitality, and nitric oxide and muscle mass. 

Most users report having positive results but not as good as the claims on King Fishers website. They say that it works best if taken for 2 weeks straight or longer. 
Most mentioned benefit that we found from users was energy. The product contains 200mg of caffeine (about 2 cups of coffee) per serving.  The downside to this is if you are sensitive to caffeine, this is not a good choice for you. Also, the added caffeine could is bit dangerous for the heart. Thus, anyone with heart issues should check with their doctor prior to use.
The main ingredients include Fenugreek, Eurycoma Longfolia Extra, Rhodiola Rosea Extract, and Arginine-Arginine Alphaketoglutarate. For best results, the company recommends to taking 4 capsules per daily with water along with following a exercise routine.
It is our number 2 choice. To read the full review just click to Learn More.

Medical Breakthrough:  
								New Miracle Pills Discovered to Treat Erectile Dysfunction Completely.


								Dr. Oz: "This Works Better Than Viagra and Cialis"
								


Published  on

								 | Author: Chloe Davis
								


A new Erectile Dysfunction cure is helping men all over the world to get rock-hard erections on demand...

								Millions of men suffer occasional or all-the-time erectile dysfunction, and either don’t want to take traditional ED pills, or these typical pills don’t work.
							

								Celebrity medical expert Dr. Oz says,"Viagra, Levitra and Cialis have been a godsend for some men. But for many others, these pills may make their problems even worse."

Fortunately, a new all-natural pills call PRIAMAX have been discovered to help men have great sex and great orgasms, without all the side effects that traditional ED medicine brings.
And this new pill is said to work "even for men who haven’t had good erections or any erections for years," according to Dr. Oz
One user of the new pill, "Joe", reports his experience. (Joe is a composite for privacy reasons) [See below for full account of Joe's experience]
"The Cialis quit working after awhile. And I wasn’t experiencing enough down there to have successful relations with my wife."
Joe also tried taking Viagra prescribed by his doctor. “But they didn’t work either,” he reports.
Finally, Joe tried this new natural supplement pills recommended by Dr. Oz that it is said
Makes ED Melt Away Better Than Other Pills
This new pill works by fixing the cause of erectile problems.
"Viagra, Cialis, Levitra and other common ED pills just cover up the problem," Dr. Oz says. "This new pill actually addresses the root causes of ED and treats it completely."
PRIAMAX contains these special well-known aphrodisiacs — Horny Goat Weed, Muira Puama (Herbal Viagra), and MACA — all packed inside a harmless herbal pill which you can buy without any prescription.
"This complex herbal supplement also boosts sex hormone production in the body and gives men the hard-on of an 18 year old and the size and endurance of those adult film stars..." said Dr. Oz
Joe quoted: "It's amazing! I have never seen myself like this before, when I take it, my libido increases as well."

								Dr. Oz recommended to take the original PRIAMAX pill with TRTT technology that he has researched and has already been tested on thousands of men 
								with the same problem.
							
Read Below For a Full Account of Joe's Experience with Andro Enhance

								"After I placed my order, a few days later the pills arrived at my house. I couldn’t wait for us to get to bed -
								before I fell asleep, I took a pill and waited to see what happen.
							

In less than an hour I woke up with a rock hard super stiff erection,
								and believe me, when I say we banged for 1 hour and 45 minutes straight, that's no exaggeration!
							

								My manhood was so hard and my wife told me the next day that she never had an orgasm like that... ever! We were both able to achieve multiple orgasms that night. There was tons screaming and a lot of sweat. I was finally satisfied and she was too. I expected the pill to work, but this was way more than I had expected.
							

								Dr. Oz said these pills will also increase the size of your manhood. And that's exactly what happened with me too! I still find it hard to believe that this stuff turned me into a long, strong, wild beast in  bed - and all for the price of a movie ticket and without any expensive prescription. I find the results to be worth every penny and had already 
								ordered three more bottles.
							

								So, I can definitely recommend these amazing PRIAMAX pills for anyone who wants to 
								improve their sexual experience. Don’t hesitate to take advantage of PRIAMAX FREE trial offer, 
								and make sure you take it because now I’m  FINALLY satisfied. On top of my erections being on point, 
								I am now way bigger than before and lasts way longer than ever before when I use it."
							


Dr. Oz Recommend Taking PRIAMAX 15 minutes Before Intercourse For Maximum Results!

Before & After PRIAMAX



									"If there was ever a wonder pill, this is it. Not only did 
									PRIAMAX get rid of my ED, it also helped me last for almost 1.5 hours.  
									I've  been taking the pills for just over 1 month now and it's helped me 
									live a happier, more satisifying life. The pills are great and easy to take without any side effects."
									
									"Before I took them I didn't really experience sex drive and cravings for making love with my wife like I do now. These pills 
									are great and easy to take without any side effects."
								

								-John from Nacogdoches, TX

I decided to try these pills just because of curiosity and because they offered a risk-free trial, so nothing to lose.

You may not believe me that we had sex for two hours non-stop!

			Erectile Dysfunction: 5 Natural Ways for ED		
TOPICS:best ed treatmentbest male enhancementedErectile Dysfunctionmale ed 

Can you run as fast as you did when you were 20 years old? Hit a baseball as far as you once could? Probably not. But even as we age, there are still plenty of ways to stay in the game, Erectile dysfunction is not a different story. ED can occur for many reasons, to get the natural best ed treatment, you should know its causes:
Shocking Video Reveals: The “Breakthrough System” that Cures Root Cause of Erectile Dysfunction 
Sometimes it is as simple as the side effect of a particular medication. But for roughly 75% of men, the cause is more complex. ED may result from vascular disease, neurological disease, diabetes, or prostate-related treatments or surgeries. Whether you currently suffer from ED or are hoping to sidestep this condition or looking for best ed treatment, try these tips for better health and a better sex life.
1. Erectile Dysfunction  Tip 1: Start walking. According to one Harvard study, just 30 minutes of walking a day was linked with a 41% drop in risk for ED. Other research like best ed treatment suggests that moderate exercise can help restore sexual performance in obese middle-aged men with ED.
2.- Erectile Dysfunction  Tip 2: Eat right. In the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, eating a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and fish — with fewer red and processed meat and refined grains — decreased the likelihood of ED. Another tip: a chronic deficiency in vitamin B12 may contribute to erectile dysfunction. A daily multivitamin and fortified foods are the best bets for those who absorb B12 poorly, best male enhancement, including many older adults.

3. Erectile Dysfunction  Tip 3: Pay attention to your vascular health. High blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and high triglycerides can all damage arteries in the heart (causing heart attack), in the brain (causing stroke), and leading to the penis (causing ED). Low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and an expanding waistline also contribute.
Check with your doctor to find out whether your vascular system — and thus your heart, brain, and penis — is in good shape or needs a tune-up through lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medications and best ed treatment.
4. Erectile Dysfunction  Tip 4: Size matters, so get slim and stay slim. A trim waistline is one good defense — a man with a 42-inch waist is 50% more likely to have ED than one with a 32-inch waist. Getting to a healthy weight and staying there is another good strategy for avoiding or fixing ED. Obesity raises risks for vascular disease and diabetes, two major causes of ED. And excess fat interferes with several hormones that may be part of the problem as well.
5. Erectile Dysfunction  Tip 5:Move a muscle, but we’re not talking about your biceps in best ed treatment. A strong pelvic floor enhances rigidity during erections and helps keep blood from leaving the penis by pressing on a key vein.
In a British trial, three months of twice-daily sets of Kegel exercises (which strengthen these muscles), combined with biofeedback and advice on lifestyle changes —best male enhancement quitting smoking, losing weight, limiting alcohol — worked far better than just advice on lifestyle changes.

			Erectile Dysfunction: 5 Natural Ways for ED or Impotence Treatment		
TOPICS:best ed treatmentbest male enhancementedErectile Dysfunctionmale ed 

Can you run as fast as you did when you were 20 years old? Hit a baseball as far as you once could? Probably not. But even as we age, there are still plenty of ways to stay in the game, Erectile dysfunction is not a different story. ED can occur for many reasons, to get the natural best ed treatment, you should know its causes:
Shocking Video Reveals: The “Miracle Recipe” that ENDS Erectile Dysfunction For Good
Sometimes it is as simple as the side effect of a particular medication. But for roughly 75% of men, the cause is more complex. ED may result from vascular disease, neurological disease, diabetes, or prostate-related treatments or surgeries. Whether you currently suffer from ED or are hoping to sidestep this condition or looking for best ed treatment, try these tips for better health and a better sex life.
1. Erectile Dysfunction  Tip 1: Start walking. According to one Harvard study, just 30 minutes of walking a day was linked with a 41% drop in risk for ED. Other research like best ed treatment suggests that moderate exercise can help restore sexual performance in obese middle-aged men with ED.
2.- Erectile Dysfunction  Tip 2: Eat right. In the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, eating a diet rich in fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and fish — with fewer red and processed meat and refined grains — decreased the likelihood of ED. Another tip: a chronic deficiency in vitamin B12 may contribute to erectile dysfunction. A daily multivitamin and fortified foods are the best bets for those who absorb B12 poorly, best male enhancement, including many older adults.

3. Erectile Dysfunction  Tip 3: Pay attention to your vascular health. High blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and high triglycerides can all damage arteries in the heart (causing heart attack), in the brain (causing stroke), and leading to the penis (causing ED). Low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and an expanding waistline also contribute.
Check with your doctor to find out whether your vascular system — and thus your heart, brain, and penis — is in good shape or needs a tune-up through lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medications and best ed treatment.
4. Erectile Dysfunction  Tip 4: Size matters, so get slim and stay slim. A trim waistline is one good defense — a man with a 42-inch waist is 50% more likely to have ED than one with a 32-inch waist. Getting to a healthy weight and staying there is another good strategy for avoiding or fixing ED. Obesity raises risks for vascular disease and diabetes, two major causes of ED. And excess fat interferes with several hormones that may be part of the problem as well.
5. Erectile Dysfunction  Tip 5:Move a muscle, but we’re not talking about your biceps in best ed treatment. A strong pelvic floor enhances rigidity during erections and helps keep blood from leaving the penis by pressing on a key vein.
In a British trial, three months of twice-daily sets of Kegel exercises (which strengthen these muscles), combined with biofeedback and advice on lifestyle changes —best male enhancement quitting smoking, losing weight, limiting alcohol — worked far better than just advice on lifestyle changes.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
