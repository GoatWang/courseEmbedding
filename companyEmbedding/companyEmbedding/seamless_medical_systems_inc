How to Choose Incontinence Protection
Incontinence can affect anyone of any age and it often comes in stages. The severity of leakage can stay the same for years, progressively get worse, or it may even go away if the body can heal or recover. Your doctor or continence nurse should give you a good evaluation of the potential outlook.


Pads can often fit neatly and comfortably inside the user's undergarment. In contrast, protective underwear and briefs (diapers) are simply worn like underwear. Not all incontinence products are created equal, so the choice will depend on how much absorption is needed, whether the user is male or female and other factors. Below we have described incontinence categories, urinary conditions and related products to give you a good idea of what will work best for you or your loved one.


Light Bladder Leakage
Light bladder leakage requires the least amount of absorbency material. However, this does not mean is made cheaper. The level of sophistication that goes into the fabric and absorption material is very high, especially with certain manufacturers who do just about everything to disguise odor, and keep skin from a urine contact -- which is something that can lead to sores, rash, and severe skin breakdown. This is done by using layered material that allows urine to soak through, neutralizes its PH level, and usually trapping the liquid, transforming it into a sold, gel-like state. Below describes a common condition that leads to light incontinence, while afterward, you will see suggested incontinence products to fit within those categories so as to give you a better idea of what to choose.

Stress Incontinence
Stress incontinence occurs with physical movement, usually sudden activity such as coughing, sneezing or heavy lifting. Despite its name, stress incontinence is not related to mental stress, or psychological anxiety. Such physical activity puts pressure, physical stress on your bladder where the bladder muscles may be weak and cannot properly react or compensate and allow urine to escape through the urethra. Stress incontinence differs from urge incontinence, which is the unintentional loss of urine caused by the bladder muscle contracting, usually associated with a sense of urgency. Stress incontinence is much more common in women than men. Because its sudden occurrence, those that have stress incontinence my isolate themselves, worrying about when it might occur and if it happens in social situations. The good news is that it is often manageable and can be treated. Light or moderate pads will give the assurance needed and Vitality Medical has a broad selection from a number of brands to choose from.

Light Bladder Leakage Pads and Liners
Pads and liners are the most discreet incontinence item one can have for urine leak protection. These pads simply rest in on top of the undergarment facing the perineum and cover areas both front and back -- discreet and unseen while worn. There are pads may be made for men or women, sometimes they are long enough for both. Depending on your needs you may want to look into the following:
Women's Light Panty Liners and Pads
Poise Liners: Small and thin, they perform the same as a thicker pad giving you confidence and comfort.
Prevail Pantyliner: Includes the Easy-Wrap individual cover, which peels directly off the adhesive strip. The thin design offers discreet, convenient protection.
Attends Bladder Control Pads: Somewhat resembling Maxi-Pads, these items are individually wrapped and make it convenient to stick in a bag or purse while out of the home.
Tena Light Bladder Control Pads: Soft and flexible, Tena Light Bladder Control Pads also have side channels to direct moisture.
Dynarex Panty Liners: For the most amount for your dollar, these pads will keep you within your budget.
Men's Light Undergarment Pads and Guards
Dignity Thinserts Liners: Thin and lightweight, the pads hold and wick away moisture even under pressure.
Briefmates Guards: Easy to handle and attach to your own underwear or boxers.
Tena Pads for Men: These have advanced absorbent protection and can absorb up to 18 times its own weight despite being a 'light' pad.
Handicare Garment Liner: It comes with a reusable cotton pant that unbuttons for easy application of the pant liner.
 

Moderate Bladder Leakage
For moderate bladder leakage one may want to consider a broader range of urine leak protection products. Instead of pads and liners, one may want to look to briefs and diapers. But before going into the selection of products, the following will give a brief overview of the common causes of moderate bladder leakage, for a better understanding of what leads to such incontinence challenges.
Urge Incontinence
As mentioned before, Urge Incontinence is experienced by someone whose bladder fills yet cannot be endured, or is unpredictable because it will sometimes have involuntary contractions pushing urine out before you can make it to the toilet. It often does not matter how much urine is in the bladder, the bladder may simply contract involuntarily at any time. It can be due to a range of issues, including disease, obstruction, and nerve damage. Sometimes the cause of Urge Incontinence is unknown. One also should note that Urge Incontinence and Stress Incontinence are not mutually exclusive. Mixed Incontinence is a combination of both and may require multiple absorption types, from light to heavy depending on your needs.
Moderate Bladder Leakage Protection Products
Pads and liners are slightly thicker than the lighter variety, yet these absorbent pads still maintain a discreet look, depending on the brand selected. Again these are the most discreet variety of products. Briefs and Underwear are the next level above pads that allows added protection and to prevent urine overflow. Below a few selections for both male and female.

Moderate Absorbency Pads, Briefs and Liners for Women
Depend Underwear for Women: Designed Just Like Regular Underwear, this underwear is easy to pull on and off.
Depend Silhouette Women's Briefs: It is made of cotton-like fabric and hides perfectly under clothes. It comes with a feminine waistband for a secure fit.
Attends Bladder Control Pads for Women: Like their light absorbency counterpart, they are also made moderate and have the size and shape of a Maxi-Pad for easy carry and concealment.
Sure Care Moderate Bladder Control Pad: It contains super-absorbent polymer absorbers to ensure dryness and cloth-like facing for extra softness.
Moderate Absorbency Pads, Briefs and Liners for Men
Prevail Boxers for Men: These are incontinence underwear for men designed with a discreet boxer style, that is more comfortable for men who are accustomed to wearing boxers rather than briefs.
Attends Regular Absorbency Underwear: Minimal design that can pass for unisex, these absorbent underwear are meant to be an efficient pull-up that can eliminate odor, allow airflow, and imitate regular cloth underwear.
Molicare Mobile Disposable Underwear: These are a top-of-the-line absorbent undergarment that has a three-layer core system to speed and disperse fluid away from the skin, while a super absorbent polymer to lock in fluid and neutralize the PH.



Heavy Bladder Leakage
For those who contend with heavy bladder leakage, it is a daily task to maintain dryness. For either the patient or caregiver, the products needed to contend with the wetness is many. This type of incontinence entails the broadest range of different products including a dearth of skin care products, bedpads, and incontinence cleaning supplies.
Overflow Incontinence
Overflow urinary incontinence is the opposite of urge incontinence. The urge to urinate isn't felt, but the bladder begins uncontrollably leaking small amounts of urine anyway. The bladder is too full, and the urine is escaping to relieve pressure. Overflow incontinence occurs often in men. It can be caused by a tumor or an enlarged prostate gland blocking the flow of urine, preventing the bladder from ever emptying completely. Diabetes, spinal cord injuries, and medications also can cause overflow incontinence.
Reflex Incontinence
A variation of Urge Incontinence, Reflex Incontinence creates a situation where you feel no need to urinate yet urine leaks when your bladder begins to contract uncontrollably.
Functional Incontinence
For those with Functional Incontinence, a physical or mental impairment keeps you from making it to the toilet in time. For example, if you have severe arthritis, you may not be able to unbutton your pants quickly enough.

Heavy Bladder Leakage Protection Products
With the most material for absorbency and substances that make up some of the most efficient urine containment, maximum leakage protection products are ideal for those who either have no bladder control or cannot use the toilet because of disability. These people need the most in protection, especially during nighttime during sleep. Getting through the night with a dry bed can be a challenge for those with heavy incontinence, but with the materials offered through Vitality Medical one will be well equipped. The following will give a brief overview of the common causes of Heavy bladder leakage and a better understanding of what leads to such incontinence challenges.
Heavy Absorbency Pads, Briefs and Liners for Women
Prevail Stretchfit Briefs: It stretches for a comfortable fit.
Tena Protective Underwear Super Plus Absorbency: The Dry-Fast CORE, contains absorbent microbeads that trap and hold the moisture in place.
Depend Adjustable Underwear: It comes with four side tabs for discreet open changing. Perforated sides neatly tear open provide easy changing.
Depend Silhouette Women's Briefs: A very feminine look with a waistband and a panty-like fit, this is a combination of function and form.
Heavy Absorbency Briefs, Pads and Liners for Men
Depend Real Fit Briefs for Men: Constructed with cotton-like fabric, Depend Real Fit Briefs give you underwear-like comfort throughout the day and is soft against the skin.
Depend Flex Fit Briefs for Men: Includes FLEX FIT Protection which flexes with the legs to accommodate an active lifestyle.

Wound Care — Gauze Packing Strips, Gauze Sponges, Hydrogels, Silicone Gel Sheeting


Wound Care
Finding the right type of wound care treatment products is a crucial step on the road to recovery. Several factors will help you determine what kind of products you will need. These factors include:
Type of wound and severity
Amount of drainage
Location of the wound on the body
What Type of Wound Is It?
Pressure Ulcers/Bedsores
Some of the different kinds of wounds that our advanced wound care products treat include pressure ulcers or bedsores, which are localized sores that occur as a result of pressure, shear, 
or friction, usually in bony areas of the body. 

For patients in hospice care or those who have limited mobility, steps must be taken to prevent pressure ulcers, particularly in bony areas or areas with limited padding such as the elbows, 
ankles, heels, buttocks, hips, and ears. Areas of the body that are in constant contact with medical devices should also be examined regularly and treated to prevent injury. 
Cleansing and moisturizing the skin regularly will be a critical step in protecting against pressure ulcers. Body cleansers and moisturizers such as the 
Moisturizing Body Cleanser and 
Moisturizing Body Cream by 
Thera will keep the wound 
clean and accelerate healing. Many of these products contain dimethicone, a protector that will strengthen the skin and decrease the chance of bed sores.
Appropriate surface support is another crucial part of 
preventing pressure ulcers. Supportive products such as the Posey Quilted Long Boots 
or Heel Protector Soft Boot take pressure off of the feet and ankles. 
Decubitus pads used on bedding and furniture wicks away moisture that 
might irritate the skin.  Pillows and wedges like the 
Spenco Foot Pillow
and Posey Lateral Wedges can also be used to provide additional support 
and reduce pressure on targeted areas.
Stage 1 pressure ulcers can be treated by placing a 
Tegaderm Transparent Film Dressing or a 
Hydrocolloid dressing
with a film backing that will keep the area dry and decrease friction. This will be particularly 
helpful if the ulcer is in an area that comes in contact with incontinence. The transparent film will allow you to keep an eye on the area.
Stage 2 pressure ulcers should be cleaned with a wound cleanser and covered with a hydrocolloid dressing or a hydrogel dressing such as the 
Medihoney HCS Hydrogel Dressing. 
Appropriate secondary dressings may also be 
required for non-adhering primary dressings. For wounds with moderate to have amounts of drainage, 
Calcium Alginate Dressings
or Hydrofiber Dressings
absorb wound fluid.
Stage 3 and 4 pressure ulcers with minimal amounts of drainage should also be cleaned with a wound cleanser and covered with a 
hydrogel dressings, 
hydrophilic wound dressings, 
or a hydrocolloid wound dressing
. Heavy drainage should be covered with a calcium alginate such as the 
Calcium Alginate Wound Dressing  by McKesson 
or a Composite Dressings by Smith & Nephew.
They should then be covered with a secondary bandage such as 
adhesive foam.
Venous Leg Ulcers
Usually a result of venous congestion in the legs and feet, these types of ulcers commonly occur in patients with edema. They are often found on the lower sides of the legs. Venous leg ulcers 
can be prevented and treated with compression dressings that will relieve pressure around the wound. Products such as the 
Unna Boot provide compression that will help manage Venous Ulcers. 

Arterial Ulcers
These types of ulcers are caused by the blockage of blood flow due to conditions such as Peripheral Arterial Disease. They typically develop in areas that are exposed to pressure, such as 
the legs or feet. If the wound is dry or has light drainage, 
MEDIHONEY Gel can be used to dress the wound and can be covered with a hydrophilic wound dressing. A secondary covering such as 
bordered gauze should be used to secure the dressings. Wounds with heavy drainage will require a calcium alginate or hydrofiber dressing.
Neuropathic/Diabetic Ulcers
Neuropathic and diabetic ulcers are often the result of a lack of feeling, usually in the feet. The lack of sensation in the feet for many diabetic patients can lead to irritation in the bony 
areas of the foot, where pressure is continually applied which can lead to the breakdown of tissue and cause an ulcer. If these ulcers have minimal drainage, they can be covered with 
MEDIHONEY Gel, 
hydrogel dressings, or 
hydrophilic wound dressings.  
For heavier drainage, an absorptive calcium alginate or hydrofiber dressing will help the wound dry and heal.
Skin Tears
Skin tears often occur in people with fragile skin, including the elderly or very ill patients. They can be caused by shear, friction, or a blunt force that causes the skin layers to separate. 
They must be properly treated to avoid the risk of becoming a complex wound. If the skin tear is dry with little drainage, a non-adhesive dressing such as a 
DermaGel Hydrogel Sheet that will protect 
the delicate skin while providing moisture that will accelerate healing. If the drainage is heavy, calcium alginate or a hydrofiber will help absorb the moisture.
Burns
The degree of severity of the burn will determine the type of wound treatment necessary to treat the injury and prevent infection.  A first degree burn is limited to the epidermis and can cause 
some tenderness and pain. A second degree burn reaches down into the papillary and could cause blisters and drainage. A third degree burn destroys most of the skin tissue, including the nerves. 
It can cause a block in blood flow and requires medical attention.  

First degree burns generally do not require a dressing, but 
MEDIHONEY Gel or 
MEDIHONEY Paste 
can relieve pain and promote healing. Second degree burns can be treated with 
xeroform impregnated gauze to 
reduce the risk of infection and maintain a moist environment that accelerates healing. Third degree burns should always be treated by medical professional. 

How Should I Treat a Dry Wound Or A Wound With Light Drainage? 
For wounds with little to no drainage, moisture is necessary to accelerate the healing process. 
Hydrogel dressings add moisture to the wound and soften the tissue to promote debridement, 
or the removal of dead tissue. 
Film or 
foam hydrocolloid dressings also absorb small amounts of drainage. These adhesive bandages are air and water tight to keep the wound dry and prevent 
infection. They can be used as a primary or secondary dressing and are great for protecting areas that may be exposed to incontinence as they protect the wound and can easily be wiped off. 

How Should I Dress a Wound that Has Heavy Drainage?  
For wounds with moderate to heavy drainage, absorbing the drainage without drying out the wound is important. The first step is always to cleanse the wound using saline or a wound cleanser
such as the Dermal Wound Cleanser by McKesson. 
Calcium alginate dressings such as the 
Calcium Alginate Dressing by McKesson 
 can then be applied to wounds associated with diabetes, venous wounds, burns, pressures ulcers, cavity wounds, etc. They made with natural alginate fibers from 
seaweed. When applied to area, the calcium alginate becomes a moist, gel-like substance that helps heal the wound while absorbing excess fluid. 

Hydrofiber dressings are also designed to help manage wounds with moderate to high drainage. Able to absorb moisture equivalent to 30 times its weight, these types of dressings provide a 
moist environment that promotes debridement and healing. 
Silicone adhesive dressings are soft and provide gentle, breathable adhesion. They are perfect for areas with sensitive or fragile skin. 
They provide protection from moisture and bacteria. Medihoney products such as 
MEDIHONEY alginate
 or 
 MEDIHONEY Paste can also be used to help heal exuding wounds. Medihoney products have an 
osmotic effect that pulls fluid from deep within the wound, which assists with autolytic debridement.
Where is the Wound Located?  
Wounds that are located in areas that are frequently exposed to moisture, such as the nose area or buttocks, should be covered with a waterproof dressing that can be wiped off. These dressing 
can serve as primary or secondary dressings, depending on the severity of the wound. 
Opsite Flexigrid Transparent Adhesive Film Dressings 
can be used to keep the area dry and allow the patient 
or caregiver to see how the wound is progressing. They can be placed directly on the wound or over a primary dressing.  Composite Dressings such as the 
Barrier Island Dressings by McKesson 
can be both a primary and a secondary dressing with non-adhesive gauze in the center of the bandage with an adhesive border. The opposite side of the bandage is water resistant and will help 
you keep the wound clean.

                leading urgent care centers and retail clinics. We understand
                unscheduled care workflows, and as a result, patients move

                pre-registering for appointments. Forms are completed via tablet
                or kiosk and automatically upload to your systems so there's
                no paper, no data entry. Your staff focuses on patients not paperwork.
                Seamless customers report a 20% increase in staff productivity and

                99% patient satisfaction I  20% increase in staff productivity  I  40% reduction in patient door-to-door time
            


                Capturing patient information at registration is a challenge for
                community health centers. The Seamless Patient Platform™
                replaces antiquated, confusing paper forms with user-friendly
                iPads pre-loaded with multilingual forms. Patient information
                automatically uploads to practice management and EMR systems.
                Complete, accurate patient information on the front end supports
                greater access to care, enables clinicians to provide the right care,
                improves case management, and supports more robust
                reimbursement. With duplicative data entry and scanning
                eliminated, staff stress is gone and the focus is on
                patients not paperwork.

Seamless Medical Systems' SNAP® Practice is a Patient Engagement Platform that replaces the waiting room clipboard with an iPad, automates the paper-based registration process and delivers important health and wellness information to the patient in the waiting or exam room.  SNAP Practice is a cloud-based enterprise solution connecting patients and practice across the care continuum with 3… · More components: 1. Digital patient data capture integrated with the practice EHR.  2. Health education that is personalized to each patient's demographics and health conditions to improve health literacy and compliance. 3. Communications tools for the practice to engage the patient outside the clinic to improve care plan adherence and customer loyalty. SNAP Practice eliminates paper, printing, scanning, shredding and the transcription of handwritten documents into electronic medical records, reducing costly errors, saving time and money, while engaging patients in their health.
