About RiverNorth


      RiverNorth Capital Management, LLC is an investment management firm 
      founded in 2000. With approximately $3.6 billion in assets under 
      management as of October 31, 2016, RiverNorth specializes in 
      opportunistic investment strategies in niche markets where the potential 
      to exploit inefficiencies is greatest. RiverNorth is the investment 
      manager to multiple registered and private funds.
    

Investors should consider the Fund's investment objective, risks, 
      charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus should 
      be read carefully before investing. For more information, please read 
      the prospectus, call your financial professional or call 800.617.0004.


      The Fund is a closed-end fund, and closed-end funds do not continuously 
      issue shares for sale as open-end mutual funds do. Since the initial 
      public offering has closed, the Fund now trades in the secondary market. 
      Investors wishing to buy or sell shares need to place orders through an 
      intermediary or broker. The share price of a closed-end fund is based on 
      the market's value.
    

      Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount 
      to their net asset value and initial offering price. The risk of loss 
      due to this discount may be greater for initial investors expecting to 
      sell their shares in a relatively short period after completion of the 
      initial public offering.
    

      An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is 
      not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed 
      as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle.
    

      Risk is inherent in all investing. Investing in any investment company 
      security involves risk, including the risk that you may receive little 
      or no return on your investment or even that you may lose part or all of 
      your investment. Therefore, before investing in the common shares of the 
      Fund, you should consider the risks as well as the other information in 
      the prospectus.

Fund Update: RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Opportunity Fund, Inc. (OPP)
2.21.2017 - CIO Patrick Galley provides an update on RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Opportunity Fund, Inc. (OPP).





Fund Update: RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Opportunity Fund, Inc. (OPP)
11.10.2016 - CIO Patrick Galley provides an update on RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Opportunity Fund, Inc. (OPP).








Investment Objective & Philosophy
RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Opportunity Fund, Inc. (the "Fund") seeks to provide current income and overall total return.
While RiverNorth Capital Management, LLC ("RiverNorth") believes markets are generally efficient, closed-end funds offer a unique structure whereby investors can purchase a diversified fund and potentially generate additional return through the change in the relationship between the closed-end fund's market price and Net Asset Value (NAV)1. RiverNorth also believes combining a closed-end fund strategy with a proven fixed income manager such as DoubleLine Capital LP ("DoubleLine®") provides an attractive investment vehicle for investors.
Diversification does not ensure a profit or guarantee against loss.



Investment Strategy
RiverNorth allocates the Fund's assets among two principal strategies: Tactical Closed-End Fund Income Strategy (managed by RiverNorth) and Opportunistic Income Strategy (managed by DoubleLine).



* Investments may include securities that have a rating that is below investment grade, including "high yield" securities. 
Target portfolio asset allocations are estimates made by the adviser and subject to change.
High yield bonds are subject to interest rate risk. If rates increase, the value generally declines.



Investment Rationale
RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Opportunity Fund, Inc. is a multi-manager closed-end fund that opportunistically invests in fixed income securities and tactically invests in closed-end funds in order to potentially provide:

Access to a diversified portfolio of fixed income securities and closed-end funds representing a wide array of underlying asset classes
Value from investments in both the closed-end fund and fixed income markets
Use of leverage in order to enhance current income and capitalize at times on market dislocations

The Fund also provides:

Contingent conversion by shareholder vote to open-end in 5 years
Active portfolio management by RiverNorth & DoubleLine, two award-winning
                    managers in their respective disciplines, who have worked together since 2010

Leverage is a speculative technique that exposes a closed-end fund to greater risk and increased costs than if it were not used. The use of leverage may cause greater volatility in the level of a closed-end fund's NAV, market price and distributions on its common shares. Leverage will also result in higher fees to the closed-end fund manager because the amount of assets under management will be included in the Fund's managed assets. There can be no assurance that a closed-end fund will use leverage or that its leveraging strategy will be successful during any period in which it is employed.



Fund Information

NYSE Ticker: OPP
Benchmark: Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index2
Income Distributions: Monthly
Capital Gains Distributions: Annually
Inception Date: 9.27.2016
Total Managed Assets: $292M as of 6.30.2017*
Anticipated Leverage: Fund aggregate leverage will be no greater than 33 ⅓% of the Fund's Managed Assets, including direct leverage and leverage utilized by underlying funds in the Tactical CEF Income sleeve
Contingent Conversion: During the calendar year 2021, the Fund will call a shareholder meeting for the purpose of voting to determine whether the Fund should convert to an open-end management investment company. If approved by shareholders, the Fund will seek to convert to an open-end management investment company within 12 months of such approval

* Managed assets include assets attributable to leverage.

Disclosures & Definitions
Risk is inherent in all investing. Investing in any investment company security involves risk, including the risk that you may receive little or no return on your investment or even that you may lose part or all of your investment. Therefore, before investing in the Common Shares, you should consider the risks as well as the other information in the prospectus.
More detailed information regarding these risks can be found in the Fund's prospectus.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Diversification does not ensure a
            profit or guarantee against loss.
An investment in the Fund is not appropriate for all investors and is not intended to be a complete investment program. The Fund is designed as a long-term investment and not as a trading vehicle.
Investors should consider the Fund's investment objective, risks, charges and expenses carefully before investing. The prospectus should be read carefully before investing. For more information, please read the prospectus, call your financial professional or call 800.617.0004.
The fund is a closed-end fund and closed-end funds do not continuously issue shares for sale as open-end mutual funds do. Since the initial public offering, the Fund now trades in the secondary market. Investors wishing to buy or sell shares need to place orders through an intermediary or broker. The share price of a closed-end fund is based on the market's value.
CFA® is a trademark owned by the CFA Institute.
DoubleLine® is a registered trademark of DoubleLine Capital LP.
1 The price at which a closed-end fund trades often varies from its NAV. Some funds have market prices below their net asset values - referred to as a discount. Conversely, some funds have market prices above their net asset values - referred to as a premium
2 The Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is an unmanaged index of investment-grade fixed-rate debt issues with maturities of at least one year. The index cannot be invested in directly and does
                not reflect fees and expenses.
3 Estimated Duration: Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of the price of a fixed income
                investment to a change in interest rates. Duration is expressed as a number of years. Duration is estimated by
                the adviser based on certain assumptions from third-party data and is subject to change.
4 30-Day SEC Yield: The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the period,
                after the deduction of the Fund's expenses.

Opportunity Knocking for RiverNorth/DoubleLine Fund

Interest-rate fear is a good thing for the recently reopened RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Income fund, says portfolio manager Patrick Galley, who discusses his comanagement with DoubleLine's Jeffrey Gundlach.

Bond CEFs Only in First Inning of Discount-Volatility Game
Archive: 2 Proposed--and Interesting--CEFs in the Pipeline



Mike Taggart: Hi. I'm Mike Taggart, head of U.S. closed-end fund research at Morningstar. With me today is Patrick Galley, portfolio manager at RiverNorth Capital Management. Patrick manages about $800 million in closed-end funds.
Patrick, thanks for joining me today.
Patrick Galley: Thanks, Mike.
Taggart: Patrick, you recently have reopened one of your funds that you comanage with Jeffrey Gundlach, the RiverNorth/DoubleLine Strategic Income Fund. It seems to me to be one of the most opportunistic funds out there. Can you talk to me a little bit just about the general investment objective?
Galley: The investment objective is to beat the Barclays Aggregate, predominantly on a risk-adjusted return basis. We're all about risk-adjusted returns at RiverNorth, so the most important objective to us is how much risk you take for incremental return.
Taggart: And how do you measure risk?
Galley: The volatility of the fund and the performance, and if sometimes we do have incremental volatility--but for that incremental volatility, we expect more return.
Taggart: One of the criticisms of the Barclays Aggregate is that it's heavily weighted with Treasuries. So isn't that kind of a little bit of a sandbagging of that index?
Galley: Well, you definitely want to have some type of benchmark that investors can measure you to, and we think the Barclays Aggregate is one of the best-known benchmarks out there. So that's what we chose, because it is a fixed-income-focused fund.
Taggart: My understanding of this fund is that it's essentially two sleeves [that are] very opportunistic. It's your sleeve with opportunistic closed-end fund investing and Jeffrey's sleeve with opportunistic fixed-income investing. Is that fair?
Galley: Yes, actually there [are] three sleeves. So DoubleLine is managing two sleeves. One is the core fixed-income strategy, that is Jeffrey's tactical Barclays Aggregate strategy and just general diversification across fixed-income. That's roughly 50% of the fund on a neutral basis. The other sleeve that DoubleLine is managing is an opportunistic income strategy that's similar to Jeffrey's hedge fund strategy, which is predominantly mortgage-backed securities--nonagency and agency mortgage-backed securities.
Then the third sleeve is managed by us at RiverNorth, and it is an opportunistic closed-end fund strategy, where we're opportunistically investing in closed-end funds when opportunities present themselves, i.e., discounts are widening out. So we'll take from the core fixed-income strategy as our dry powder and increase our closed-end fund sleeve as opportunities present themselves.
Taggart: It seems like this would explain the reopening. There are plenty of opportunities right now, it would seem, and listening to Jeffrey's calls, there are of plenty of opportunities for his opportunistic sleeve. Can you talk to me a little bit about how you decide the allocation decision across those three sleeves?
Galley: It is very opportunistic, and so given the opportunities in closed-end funds--the fear has increased in the closed-fund space, as we know, because of interest rates--discounts have widened out quite drastically. So just a short few months ago, most closed-end funds--fixed-income closed-end funds--traded at a premium to their net asset value. Today, most closed-end funds are trading at a discount to their net asset value and, in fact, only 13% of the time have they ever been wider than they are today on the fixed-income side of the equation on closed-end funds.
Read Full Transcript
Taggart: So is it safe to say that three, four months ago there was less of an allocation in the fund toward closed-end funds than there is today?
Galley: Exactly. So just about four months ago, we were 17% closed-end fund exposure; today, we're over 30% closed-end fund exposure. Probably an upper limit to closed-end fund exposure in the fund will be around 50%, because [as] most investors know, extra volatility [comes] with closed-end funds. So we don't want to concentrate the portfolio all the way to closed-end funds, but 50% is more of an upper limit.
Taggart: Gets back to the risk-adjusted comments earlier.
Galley: Exactly.
Taggart: So what's the investment process? If you could just briefly go over it for the closed-end fund sleeve, and then if you could speak for Jeffrey, both of his sleeves.
Galley: On the closed-end fund side, we are focused on fixed-income closed-end funds, first and foremost. So finding opportunities where we believe there's a catalyst for that discount to narrow, because that is our excess return. So creating, number one, a diversified portfolio across a lot of fixed-income closed-end funds, and then generating excess return by trading the discounts predominantly.
As we said before, discounts are attractive today, so increased closed-end fund exposure as the discounts widen, and as discounts narrow or mean revert, take the chips off the table, go back to Jeffrey and his core fixed-income strategy and wait for opportunities again in the closed-end fund space. So, we're being reactive to volatility, which is actually good for us, so we're excited about the future. Interest-rate fear is actually a good thing for the strategy, but with it comes sometimes some more volatility.
Taggart: And how does Jeffrey go about selecting the securities, say, in his opportunistic sleeve?
Galley: In his opportunistic sleeve, Jeffrey has a risk-balanced approach between nonagency mortgage-backed securities and agency mortgage-backed securities. So he can tactically manage the duration, first and foremost, which a lot of investors are concerned with today. But having that barbell approach where nonagency mortgage-backed securities are predominately trading at a discount to their par value and agency mortgage-backed securities are trading at a premium, it gives you a nice balance between a risk-off and risk-on environment.
Taggart: This is a strategy that's about creating income for investors, but also, as you said, you're trying to look at risk-adjusted total return. So in your mind, ideally what type of investor should be interested in this fund?
Galley: First, probably an investor that understands closed-end funds and understands that they tend to be inefficient many times. So you can generate excess return by trading off of the discount, which is unique only to closed-end funds. I think that is a characteristic of our investors. Investors that tend to be contrarian, meaning that we tend to buy when everybody else is selling and sell when everybody else is buying, so an investor that can embrace that I think will appreciate the fund and the opportunistic nature that we take.
Taggart: This fund was launched at the very end of 2010, so in 2011 and 2012, the fund outperformed the Barclays Aggregate and the Morningstar Multisector Bond category average, but in [2013] it's lagging both so far. What would you ascribe that to?
Galley: Number one, it's definitely the closed-end fund component [that] has lagged, obviously, because of closed-end funds are down in many cases 8% year to date. So if you were to compare the fund to the overall closed-end fund space, we've definitely outperformed ... We've lagged the Barclays Aggregate, I believe, by 20 basis points or so the last time I checked year to date, so not drastically. I would also say looking forward, we're really excited about the opportunity that we have in front of us. There [are] going to be periods of time of underperformance, but that underperformance usually sets us up for a pretty good opportunity. As I said before, we can increase the closed-end fund exposure in that environment and hopefully returns will come in the back end.
Taggart: Right, because part of being a contrarian investor is that you're catching a falling knife, eventually--you talk about mean reversion--the fund goes back up.
Galley: Exactly, and we don't necessarily feel like we're catching a falling knife, because the great thing about a closed-end fund is you know what it's worth, and so it's not like a stock, where it's only as good as your estimate of the intrinsic value. So because you know what it's worth and the discount is just widening out, it's more of just a sentiment play and betting against the irrationality of investors.
Taggart: Excellent. Well, thank you Patrick for walking us through this fund and best wishes for the future. Thanks for joining me today.
Galley: Thanks, Mike.
Taggart: For Morningstar, I'm Mike Taggart. Thanks for watching.

(the “Fund”), a closed-end fund that opportunistically invests in fixed income securities and tactically invests in closed-end funds. The Fund debuted September 28, 2016 on the NYSE under the symbol “OPP.” RiverNorth serves as the Fund’s investment adviser and DoubleLine Capital LP (“DoubleLine”) serves as sub-adviser to the Fund.“We are extremely excited to again partner with DoubleLine to add another unique multi-manager strategy to RiverNorth’s existing portfolio of closed-end fund offerings,” said Patrick Galley, RiverNorth’s Chief Investment Officer. “The Fund will leverage RiverNorth’s and DoubleLine’s long performance track records across market cycles and history of working together to capitalize on market inefficiencies in both the closed-end fund and fixed income markets.”The Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective of current income and overall total return by allocating among two principal investment strategies: the Tactical Closed-End Fund Income Strategy, managed by RiverNorth, and the Opportunistic Income Strategy, managed by DoubleLine. The Fund, as described in its prospectus, has flexibility to strategically allocate between these two strategies in order to select the best relative opportunities in different market environments. The Fund will provide diversification across numerous fixed income asset classes with careful regard to balancing credit and interest rate risk.“The team at DoubleLine is very pleased to extend our strategic relationship with RiverNorth into our first jointly-managed closed-end fund,” said Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO and Chief Investment Officer of DoubleLine. “As with our open-end fund collaboration, the new closed-end fund brings together complementary investment strategies.
