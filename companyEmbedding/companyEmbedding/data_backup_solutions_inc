                "Fast Start" feature preselects the files to be backed up, saving you time.
            





Powerful


 
                Go "back in time" and see your files and directories, as they were when your backups happened.
            
 
                Schedule your backups to automatically run at a specific time, on a recurring basis or when a drive is connected.
            
 
                Have your Mac automatically wake from sleep to execute scheduled backups.
            
 
                Create a bootable clone of your hard drive.

                Synchronize folders - perfect if you use more than one computer.
            







Simple Copy

            A simple copy is a basic backup of your Mac drive that includes some hidden information that can help Data Backup manage additional backups in the future. The key feature in this Mac backup software that makes a simple copy the fastest choice, is that only the files that have been changed will be backed up. Files that are no longer present in the source can be deleted in the destination.
        
Versioned 

            A versioned backup is very similar to the simple copy except the old and deleted versions of the backup will be stored inside a hidden area with your destination. All of your files in the source will be copied to the destination. When future backups are run, old versions of the files are then stored in hidden locations on within the destination. Similar to Time Machine, files from any backup date can be selected and restored.
        
Clone

            Make an exact copy by cloning a Mac hard drive. Making a clone of your drive is creating an identical bootable image of your hard drive. This kind of back up comes in handy because, with a clone of your current drive, in the event where your drive becomes unreadable or fails, you can boot from the clone that you have created. The drive has to be partitioned with the right partition map (e.g. GUID/APM). Making a clone of your drive can turn out to be an absolute lifesaver!
        
Synchronize

            A Synchronize backup method merges the contents of two drives or folders and places the complete set of data into both the source and the destination. If a file is deleted or added in either the source or destination, the file will be deleted or added on both drives.
        
Full/ Incremental

            A full backup will make a complete copy all of the files and folders present in the source. When it is completed, the destination will contain additional folder names “Full-Date” which will contain all of the files and folders that were selected to copy.
        

            An incremental backup is used with the Full Backup to make a copy of the files, which have been changed and created since the last Full or Incremental backup to additional folders called “incremental-date”.
        

            Unlike simple, clone, and versioned backups, Full/Incremental Backups do not overwrite any preexisting files present in the destination drive/folder.
        
Scheduling

            Instead of starting your backup immediately, you may choose to schedule the backup to happen in the future. The Schedule tab displays all scheduled backup events for the backup, and allows you to schedule backup sets in a variety of ways.
        

            Selected dates – specific time and data
        

            Interval – specific reoccurring internal
        

            Selected events – specific event: drive mounting, system powering on
        

        Days of week – specific days of the week
        



            The newest addition to this data backup software is that it provides a number of options for notifications when backups complete. Notifications can come via the Data Backup application, through the Mac OS X notification center (requires OS X 10.8 or higher) and via email/SMS (text message).
        

            Show notifications in the OS X Notification Center when backups complete.
        
Performance Monitor

            The Dashboard view gives you performance information while your backup is running. It also shows all scheduled events and the history for all backups, synchronizes and restores in one place.
        

            The Performance graph shows the number of files scanned per second, the number of files copied per second and the number of bytes copied per second. You can scroll back to the beginning of the backup, and zoom in or out on the graph. To the left of the Performance graph, an overview of the backup is shown. This includes information such as the number of files selected, the number copied, maximum and current rates and the start time of the backup.

Data backup has been reliably protecting my backups for over 5 years now....It runs as clockwork, every Sunday, backing up my mac drives (clone and incremental) for 2nd and 3rd sets of backups to satisfy any paranoid. I have in the past misplaced my serial number (both data backup as well as Data Rescue, and the support personnel have nothing but nice..even offering free download! Its a small company, and i have not hesitated to purchase my license from them again!

At a time when the very concept of customer service seems to be disappearing from the lexicon, ProSoft Engineering is one of the few software companies that I have tried to deal with who knows what it means, and who walks that talk! I have owned DataBack for about six years and through that time, ProSoft has never left me hanging for more than a half day when something has gone wrong or when I need to know how to proceed. They have responded quickly, clearly, and respectfully and they have always checked back to se whether I have solved my problem. Moreover, their DataBack product delivers what it promises. It is easy to set up and for those who are challenged by the necessary technical details of manuals, their tech support is there to help out. I am NOT being paid to say this: I think it is important to give praise when praise is due so those companies that care about delivering good products and backing them up get the recognition they deserve for what they are doing.

Works great AND they have excellent email customer service if there's any problem. Definitely worth paying for!

IT or operations departments typically configure backup programs for use by any team within an organization that has a need for security and peace of mind with important files. In the event of data loss, data is restored to its previous state from a backup. Different backup products utilize different methods such as a disk-to-tape (D2T), disk-to-disk (D2D), and cloud-hosted storage. Backup software tools vary in relation to size, level of security, and types of systems from which they retain data. The Backup category also includes some standalone data recovery or repair tools.
To qualify for inclusion in the Backup category, a product must:

Create copies of business data and keep them secure
Restore backup data onto devices if and when necessary

Business Needs
Backup software is essential to maintaining the safety of all your data, therefore you should assess all business needs prior to selecting the best product for your company. It is important to understand the types of data that you are backing up, which can range from social media content to files and programs or entire server operating systems. What you are backing up will greatly impact the solution you choose.
The amount of data that you need to back up will also make an impact on your decision. If you are looking to protect a single PC or a few endpoints you will most likely opt for a vastly different product than if you are backing up big data servers that contain company-wide financial information. 
   
Implementation
Implementing backup software can be a long and drawn out process depending on the amount of data you are safeguarding. Oftentimes setup can require assistance from experienced in-house IT technicians, vendor support teams, or third-party implementers. It can be valuable to take the time to evaluate how many resources you have available both in-house and through outside options and base your implementation decision off that assessment. A major factor for the way you can go about implementing backup software also depends on whether or not you choose a cloud-hosted or on-premise solution.
   
Cloud vs. On-Premise
Cloud options are becoming more popular for backup software, as they are in all software spaces, but there are benefits and downfalls to both cloud and on-premise options. Having a cloud-hosted backup solution can be a more effortless option when you are consistently increasing the amount of data you are preserving because of the automatic and continuous backups that are being updated into the cloud. Cloud services are also convenient in the event of a physical disaster that destroys data due to a more seamless recovery and restoration process.
There are a few different on-premise backup choices, including basic on-site backup or maintaining an additional data warehouse off-site. These options can involve disk-to-disk or disk-to-tape storage practices. These options are useful and comforting because of the physical containment of the information, but can be problematic if the hard copies are somehow jeopardized. 
Suites
Some backup solutions offer a more robust suite of features that provides further functionality, including replication, recovery and restoration, and virtualization. These suites are usually more appropriate for enterprise-sized companies, but can be helpful for small and mid-market businesses. They can provide an overall data backup management platform and, at times, can be more cost efficient than purchasing individual solutions from different vendors. Depending on your needs, a suite may be a better option than a scoped, standalone product.
Scalability
As the amount of data you are protecting scales, so will your protection needs. It is crucial to find a solution that can grow with your business. Cloud products can be advantageous for scaling due to the unlimited space available and because there is no need to directly implement more software into your system. Products with deduplication features are conducive to scaling businesses since they keep the quality of your data high and maximize storage capacity.
Security
Security threats are becoming increasingly complex and aggressive, therefore your backup solution should be able to adapt and defend against new types of attacks. While cloud options are the popular trend, they can be more vulnerable to threats than on-premise software. Also, when backing up personal or login and password information you should take extra precaution to protect yourself from attacks. While total data security may require other forms of software, the backup solution you choose should not have gaps that allow easy access to outside threats and practices in place in the event that your data does get compromised. 
Pricing
There are a variety of pricing models for backup software. On-premise software can be charged by the amount of data you are having protected, while cloud versions sometimes charge standard subscription fees regardless of quantity of data. There can also be expenses for implementation services, so it is important to find which total procedure is most cost effective if you are working on a budget.
Key Benefits of Backup Software

Have access to complete copies of your company’s database.
Protect valuable data in the event of a network breach or physical disaster. 
Quickly recover and restore information when issues do arise.
Increase confidence in your company’s durability despite more advanced malicious threats.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
