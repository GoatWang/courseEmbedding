Vincent Walker "Vince" Foster Jr. (January 15, 1945 – July 20, 1993) was a Deputy White House Counsel during the first half-year of President Bill Clinton's administration. Prior to that, he was a partner at Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he was a colleague and friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton and where, as The Washington Post later wrote, he rose to "the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment."[1] At the White House he was unhappy with work in politics and spiraled into depression. His death by gunshot was attributed by five official or governmental investigations to suicide but several conspiracy theories emerged.

Early life[edit]
Foster was born in Hope, Arkansas, to Alice Mae and Vincent W. Foster.[2] His father became prosperous from real estate sales and development.[3][4] Vincent had two sisters, Sheila and Sharon.[2] He was a childhood neighbor and friend of Bill Clinton for four of the first five years of his life, until Clinton moved away. As Clinton later recalled, "I lived with my grandparents in a modest little house across from Vince Foster's nice, big, white brick house."[5] Another childhood friend was Mack McLarty, who would one day become White House Chief of Staff for Clinton.[6]
Foster excelled as a student and athlete.[5] At Hope High School, he became president of the student council, with McLarty as vice president.[6] He graduated from there in 1963.[2]
Foster attended Davidson College, graduating with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1967.[4][7] His father wanted him to join the family real estate business, but he instead chose law.[3]
After starting at Vanderbilt University Law School, he joined the Arkansas National Guard during the height of the Vietnam War[3] to avoid the military draft.[4] To be closer to his guard responsibilities, he transferred to the University of Arkansas School of Law,[3] where he was managing editor of the law review[2] and received his Juris Doctor in 1971, graduating first in his class.[3] He scored the highest in his class on the Arkansas bar exam.[3]
Foster met Elizabeth Braden, known as Lisa, during his sophomore year at Davidson; she was the daughter of an insurance broker from Nashville and was attending Sweet Briar College.[3] They married on April 20, 1968,[8] at St. Henry Catholic Church in Nashville.[3] They had three children: Vincent III, Laura, and John.[3]
Arkansas lawyer[edit]
In 1971, Foster joined Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas,[9] and in 1974 was made partner,[2] one of only nine in the firm at the time.[10] He was the head of the Arkansas Bar Association committee that oversaw legal aid, and as such worked with legal aid clinic worker Hillary Rodham in successfully overcoming an unreasonable measuring requirement for indigent clients.[9] Foster then initiated the hiring of Rodham at Rose Law Firm, where she became its first ever female associate[9] (and later first female partner); Foster and fellow partner Webster Hubbell were instrumental in overcoming the reluctance of other partners to hire a woman.[10] Foster and Rodham worked together on a number of cases.[7]




Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, where Foster worked for two decades


Foster practiced mostly corporate law,[11] eventually earning nearly $300,000 a year.[11] Known for his extensive preparation of cases ahead of time, including the creation of decision trees,[6] Foster developed a reputation as one of the best trial litigators in Arkansas.[7] Hillary Clinton's memoirs call Foster "one of the best lawyers I've ever known," and compared him in style and substance to Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch in the classic 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird.[9] Writer Carl Bernstein has described Foster as "tall, with impeccable manners and a formal mien ... elegant in perfectly tailored suits, and soft-spoken to the point of taciturnity."[10] Writer Dan Moldea characterized him as "a 'can-do' lawyer who worked best when under pressure."[4] Phillip Carroll, the leading litigator at Rose Law Firm, once said of Foster, "He was my ideal of a young lawyer."[12] The ABA Journal reported that Foster was "acknowledged by many as the soul of the firm".[12]
He appeared to experience only success at Rose Law; a partner later said, "I never saw a professional setback. Never. Not even a tiny one."[11] The firm grew five times its size during his time there.[6] The Arkansas Bar Association gave him a number of awards[5] and in June 1993 would name him as its Outstanding Lawyer of the Year.[4] He was also listed in the Best Lawyers in America book.[6] His wife Lisa described him as driven to prevail, staying up around the clock to prepare for big cases, believing he would lose the case even though he rarely did; she later viewed this as an early sign of depressed behavior.[3]
By 1992, Vince Foster was, as The Washington Post later wrote, at "the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment."[1] He was also an established figure in Little Rock society, serving as the chair of the board of the Arkansas Repertory Theatre and belonging to the exclusive Country Club of Little Rock.[6]
White House Counsel[edit]
After Clinton's 1992 election, Foster joined Clinton's presidential transition team.[6] Once Clinton was inaugurated, Foster joined his White House staff as Deputy White House Counsel in early 1993.[2] This was despite Foster's initial reluctance to leave his Little Rock life behind and come to Washington.[3][6] There he worked under the White House Counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum, although Nussbaum would consider the pair to be "co-senior partners".[6] He was also joined with two other Rose Law Firm partners: William H. Kennedy, III, who served as his associate counsel, and Webster Hubbell, who became Associate Attorney General.[13] The Foster residence was a small rented house in Georgetown in Washington, D.C.[6]
Foster had difficulty making the transition to life and politics in Washington.[1] Unlike some other Clinton-associated figures, he had had no experience with campaigns or politics at all.[6] His wife and youngest son were not with him, having stayed behind in Arkansas so the son could complete his senior year of high school at Catholic High in Little Rock.[6][14] His initial role was in vetting potential administration appointees, and in this he was one of the key figures in the transition.[6] As one subject of the vetting process later said, "I wondered why I was being interviewed by the guy who would be deputy counsel. Seemed his job was to find out how honest I was, and what level of ego I was bringing. It's a measure of how much the Clintons trusted him."[6] But Foster found this involvement in vetting appointments to be causing him depression and anxiety.[1] In particular, he blamed himself for the failed Zoë Baird nomination;[1] he had thought that Baird had been justified in following her lawyer's advice regarding the payment of taxes on household employees, but he had failed to anticipate the political backlash that led to it becoming known as "Nannygate" and that blemished the early days of the administration.[6] The equally unsuccessful Kimba Wood and Lani Guinier appointments were also under Foster's purview.[15] He had to resign from the Country Club of Little Rock once its all-white membership became a political issue for others in the administration.[6]
As Deputy Counsel, Foster was also involved in a range of other matters, including preparation of executive orders, analyzing the legal effect of various policies, examining international treaties, discussing the ramifications of authorizations for use of military force, and authorizing expenditures within the White House.[6] Foster worked on placing the Clintons' financial holdings into a blind trust.[6]
He handled the Clintons' Madison Guaranty and Industrial Development Corporation paperwork[16] and also several Whitewater-related tax returns.[17] He worked twelve-hour days, six or seven days a week, and although thin to begin with, began losing weight.[6][18]
On May 8, 1993, Foster gave the commencement address at his University of Arkansas Law School alma mater, and said:

The reputation you develop for intellectual and ethical integrity will be your greatest asset or your worst enemy. You will be judged by your judgment. ... Treat every pleading, every brief, every contract, every letter, every daily task as if your career will be judged on it... There is no victory, no advantage, no fee, no favor, which is worth even a blemish on your reputation for intellect and integrity. ... Dents to the reputation in the legal profession are irreparable."[14][6]

One faculty member listening to it recalled telling another that it was "the most depressing graduation speech I had ever heard, in both content and manner."[18] A friend of Foster's has said, "Look, it's just crazy, right? You get one dent and it can never be fixed? In Washington, you get them all the time. You get twenty dents and you go to the body shop. Vince couldn't see that, apparently."[6]
Four days after the speech, the White House travel office controversy erupted.[14][6] Foster was the target of several hostile Wall Street Journal editorials in June and July 1993,[1] with titles such as "Who is Vincent Foster?"[11] He became quite upset over the travel office matter and the possibility of a congressional hearing[1] at which he might have been called to testify.[15] Disliking the public spotlight[11] and suffering from continued weight loss and insomnia,[1] he considered resigning his position but feared a personal humiliation upon returning to Arkansas.[1]
Death[edit]
Main article: Suicide of Vince Foster




Grave of Vince Foster at Memory Gardens Cemetery in his boyhood home of Hope


Struggling with depression,[11][1] which after his death was assessed as clinical depression,[19] Foster was prescribed the anti-depressant medication trazodone over the phone by his Arkansas doctor, starting with a low initial dosage.[11] The next day, Foster was found dead in Fort Marcy Park, a federal park in Virginia. An autopsy determined that he was shot in the mouth and no other wounds were found on his body.[20]
A draft resignation letter was found torn into 27 pieces in his briefcase. The letter contained a list of grievances, including, "The WSJ editors lie without consequence"[21] and saying, "I was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life in Washington. Here ruining people is considered sport."
His funeral mass was held at the Cathedral of St. Andrew Catholic Church in Little Rock.[7] Bill Clinton gave a eulogy in which he recalled their boyhood times together and quoted a line from Leon Russell's "A Song for You": "I love you in a place that has no space and time."[22]
Foster was buried in Memory Gardens Cemetery in his hometown of Hope. Foster was 48 years old and was survived by his wife and three children.
Subsequent investigations[edit]
Five official or governmental investigations into Foster's death all concluded that he committed suicide.[23]
1. The first was by the United States Park Police in 1993, in whose jurisdiction the original investigation fell.[24] Because of Foster's position in the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation assisted in the investigation, as did several other state and federal agencies.[24] The result of this investigation was released as a joint report from the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Park Police on August 10, 1993, and it stated: "The condition of the scene, the medical examiner's findings and the information gathered clearly indicate that Mr. Foster committed suicide."[24]
2. Investigations by a coroner and Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske, in a 58-page report released on June 30, 1994, also concluded that Foster had committed suicide.[15] This report made use of FBI resources and incorporated the views of several experienced pathologists; it concluded: "The overwhelming weight of the evidence compels the conclusion ... that Vincent Foster committed suicide in Fort Marcy Park on July 20, 1993."[24]
3 and 4. Two investigations by the U.S. Congress found that Foster committed suicide:[15]
One was by Representative William F. Clinger Jr. from Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, who reached this conclusion in a finding published on August 12, 1994.[24]
The other was by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, wherein both the majority Democratic and minority Republican reports reached the same conclusion in reports issued on January 3, 1995.[24]
Theories of a cover-up persisted, however,[25] some of which were promulgated by the Arkansas Project.[26] The speculation and conspiracy theories featured on talk radio and elsewhere caused pain to the Foster family.[1]
5. After a three-year investigation, Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr[25] released a report on October 10, 1997, also concluding that the death was a suicide.[15][27] In response, Sheila Foster Anthony, Vince Foster's sister, said she agreed with Starr's findings but criticized his investigation for having taken so long, thus contributing to the existence of "ridiculous conspiracy theories proffered by those with a profit or political motive".[27]
Legacy[edit]
Foster's death, occurring just six months into the new administration, is thought by some to have ended the optimism and remaining innocence of the White House staff.[28] White House chief of staff and childhood friend Mack McLarty said that "It was a deep cut. It clearly had a tremendous impact."[28] Nussbaum speculated that if Foster had lived, he would have helped resist the calls to appoint independent counsels and the many investigations lumped under the Whitewater umbrella that occupied the administration and Clinton for the rest of his presidency might not have happened.[28] As it did happen, how Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, Maggie Williams, in particular handled Foster's files and documents immediately after his death became an issue of much investigation itself.[15][29]
Years later, Bill Clinton expressed his continued anger about the Foster rumors and theories, clenching a fist as he spoke: "I heard a lot of the right-wing talk show people ... and all the sleazy stuff they said. They didn't give a rip that he had killed himself or that his family was miserable or that they could break the hearts [of Foster's friends and family]. It was just another weapon to slug us with, to dehumanize us with."[18]
Foster's passing also had an effect on Rose Law Firm, as many within the firm had expected Foster to become its leader once he returned from service in Washington.[12] As one partner later said, "In meetings of the partners, he didn't often take a vocal stand. ... But when he did, it almost always swayed the firm. When he left for Washington, people here spoke openly about the emotional vacuum."[6] Colleagues speculated that Foster might have someday become president of the state bar association or a choice for a federal judgeship.[3]
Beginning in 1993, the Vince Foster, Jr., Outstanding Lawyer Award was given out annually by the Pulaski County Bar Association to recognize members who contributed to the bar and advanced the legal profession.[30] An endowed chair at the University of Arkansas School of Law, the Vincent Foster University Professor of Legal Ethics and Professional Responsibility, was created in his name.[7] In 2015 a holder of the chair, Howard W. Brill, was appointed Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court.

Early life[edit]
Foster was born in Hope, Arkansas, to Alice Mae and Vincent W. Foster.[2] His father became prosperous from real estate sales and development.[3][4] Vincent had two sisters, Sheila and Sharon.[2] He was a childhood neighbor and friend of Bill Clinton for four of the first five years of his life, until Clinton moved away. As Clinton later recalled, "I lived with my grandparents in a modest little house across from Vince Foster's nice, big, white brick house."[5] Another childhood friend was Mack McLarty, who would one day become White House Chief of Staff for Clinton.[6]
Foster excelled as a student and athlete.[5] At Hope High School, he became president of the student council, with McLarty as vice president.[6] He graduated from there in 1963.[2]
Foster attended Davidson College, graduating with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1967.[4][7] His father wanted him to join the family real estate business, but he instead chose law.[3]
After starting at Vanderbilt University Law School, he joined the Arkansas National Guard during the height of the Vietnam War[3] to avoid the military draft.[4] To be closer to his guard responsibilities, he transferred to the University of Arkansas School of Law,[3] where he was managing editor of the law review[2] and received his Juris Doctor in 1971, graduating first in his class.[3] He scored the highest in his class on the Arkansas bar exam.[3]
Foster met Elizabeth Braden, known as Lisa, during his sophomore year at Davidson; she was the daughter of an insurance broker from Nashville and was attending Sweet Briar College.[3] They married on April 20, 1968,[8] at St. Henry Catholic Church in Nashville.[3] They had three children: Vincent III, Laura, and John.[3]
Arkansas lawyer[edit]
In 1971, Foster joined Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas,[9] and in 1974 was made partner,[2] one of only nine in the firm at the time.[10] He was the head of the Arkansas Bar Association committee that oversaw legal aid, and as such worked with legal aid clinic worker Hillary Rodham in successfully overcoming an unreasonable measuring requirement for indigent clients.[9] Foster then initiated the hiring of Rodham at Rose Law Firm, where she became its first ever female associate[9] (and later first female partner); Foster and fellow partner Webster Hubbell were instrumental in overcoming the reluctance of other partners to hire a woman.[10] Foster and Rodham worked together on a number of cases.[7]




Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, where Foster worked for two decades


Foster practiced mostly corporate law,[11] eventually earning nearly $300,000 a year.[11] Known for his extensive preparation of cases ahead of time, including the creation of decision trees,[6] Foster developed a reputation as one of the best trial litigators in Arkansas.[7] Hillary Clinton's memoirs call Foster "one of the best lawyers I've ever known," and compared him in style and substance to Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch in the classic 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird.[9] Writer Carl Bernstein has described Foster as "tall, with impeccable manners and a formal mien ... elegant in perfectly tailored suits, and soft-spoken to the point of taciturnity."[10] Writer Dan Moldea characterized him as "a 'can-do' lawyer who worked best when under pressure."[4] Phillip Carroll, the leading litigator at Rose Law Firm, once said of Foster, "He was my ideal of a young lawyer."[12] The ABA Journal reported that Foster was "acknowledged by many as the soul of the firm".[12]
He appeared to experience only success at Rose Law; a partner later said, "I never saw a professional setback. Never. Not even a tiny one."[11] The firm grew five times its size during his time there.[6] The Arkansas Bar Association gave him a number of awards[5] and in June 1993 would name him as its Outstanding Lawyer of the Year.[4] He was also listed in the Best Lawyers in America book.[6] His wife Lisa described him as driven to prevail, staying up around the clock to prepare for big cases, believing he would lose the case even though he rarely did; she later viewed this as an early sign of depressed behavior.[3]
By 1992, Vince Foster was, as The Washington Post later wrote, at "the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment."[1] He was also an established figure in Little Rock society, serving as the chair of the board of the Arkansas Repertory Theatre and belonging to the exclusive Country Club of Little Rock.[6]
White House Counsel[edit]
After Clinton's 1992 election, Foster joined Clinton's presidential transition team.[6] Once Clinton was inaugurated, Foster joined his White House staff as Deputy White House Counsel in early 1993.[2] This was despite Foster's initial reluctance to leave his Little Rock life behind and come to Washington.[3][6] There he worked under the White House Counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum, although Nussbaum would consider the pair to be "co-senior partners".[6] He was also joined with two other Rose Law Firm partners: William H. Kennedy, III, who served as his associate counsel, and Webster Hubbell, who became Associate Attorney General.[13] The Foster residence was a small rented house in Georgetown in Washington, D.C.[6]
Foster had difficulty making the transition to life and politics in Washington.[1] Unlike some other Clinton-associated figures, he had had no experience with campaigns or politics at all.[6] His wife and youngest son were not with him, having stayed behind in Arkansas so the son could complete his senior year of high school at Catholic High in Little Rock.[6][14] His initial role was in vetting potential administration appointees, and in this he was one of the key figures in the transition.[6] As one subject of the vetting process later said, "I wondered why I was being interviewed by the guy who would be deputy counsel. Seemed his job was to find out how honest I was, and what level of ego I was bringing. It's a measure of how much the Clintons trusted him."[6] But Foster found this involvement in vetting appointments to be causing him depression and anxiety.[1] In particular, he blamed himself for the failed Zoë Baird nomination;[1] he had thought that Baird had been justified in following her lawyer's advice regarding the payment of taxes on household employees, but he had failed to anticipate the political backlash that led to it becoming known as "Nannygate" and that blemished the early days of the administration.[6] The equally unsuccessful Kimba Wood and Lani Guinier appointments were also under Foster's purview.[15] He had to resign from the Country Club of Little Rock once its all-white membership became a political issue for others in the administration.[6]
As Deputy Counsel, Foster was also involved in a range of other matters, including preparation of executive orders, analyzing the legal effect of various policies, examining international treaties, discussing the ramifications of authorizations for use of military force, and authorizing expenditures within the White House.[6] Foster worked on placing the Clintons' financial holdings into a blind trust.[6]
He handled the Clintons' Madison Guaranty and Industrial Development Corporation paperwork[16] and also several Whitewater-related tax returns.[17] He worked twelve-hour days, six or seven days a week, and although thin to begin with, began losing weight.[6][18]
On May 8, 1993, Foster gave the commencement address at his University of Arkansas Law School alma mater, and said:

The reputation you develop for intellectual and ethical integrity will be your greatest asset or your worst enemy. You will be judged by your judgment. ... Treat every pleading, every brief, every contract, every letter, every daily task as if your career will be judged on it... There is no victory, no advantage, no fee, no favor, which is worth even a blemish on your reputation for intellect and integrity. ... Dents to the reputation in the legal profession are irreparable."[14][6]

One faculty member listening to it recalled telling another that it was "the most depressing graduation speech I had ever heard, in both content and manner."[18] A friend of Foster's has said, "Look, it's just crazy, right? You get one dent and it can never be fixed? In Washington, you get them all the time. You get twenty dents and you go to the body shop. Vince couldn't see that, apparently."[6]
Four days after the speech, the White House travel office controversy erupted.[14][6] Foster was the target of several hostile Wall Street Journal editorials in June and July 1993,[1] with titles such as "Who is Vincent Foster?"[11] He became quite upset over the travel office matter and the possibility of a congressional hearing[1] at which he might have been called to testify.[15] Disliking the public spotlight[11] and suffering from continued weight loss and insomnia,[1] he considered resigning his position but feared a personal humiliation upon returning to Arkansas.[1]
Death[edit]

Struggling with depression,[11][1] which after his death was assessed as clinical depression,[19] Foster was prescribed the anti-depressant medication trazodone over the phone by his Arkansas doctor, starting with a low initial dosage.[11] The next day, Foster was found dead in Fort Marcy Park, a federal park in Virginia. An autopsy determined that he was shot in the mouth and no other wounds were found on his body.[20]
A draft resignation letter was found torn into 27 pieces in his briefcase. The letter contained a list of grievances, including, "The WSJ editors lie without consequence"[21] and saying, "I was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life in Washington. Here ruining people is considered sport."
His funeral mass was held at the Cathedral of St. Andrew Catholic Church in Little Rock.[7] Bill Clinton gave a eulogy in which he recalled their boyhood times together and quoted a line from Leon Russell's "A Song for You": "I love you in a place that has no space and time."[22]
Foster was buried in Memory Gardens Cemetery in his hometown of Hope. Foster was 48 years old and was survived by his wife and three children.
Subsequent investigations[edit]
Five official or governmental investigations into Foster's death all concluded that he committed suicide.[23]
1. The first was by the United States Park Police in 1993, in whose jurisdiction the original investigation fell.[24] Because of Foster's position in the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation assisted in the investigation, as did several other state and federal agencies.[24] The result of this investigation was released as a joint report from the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Park Police on August 10, 1993, and it stated: "The condition of the scene, the medical examiner's findings and the information gathered clearly indicate that Mr. Foster committed suicide."[24]
2. Investigations by a coroner and Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske, in a 58-page report released on June 30, 1994, also concluded that Foster had committed suicide.[15] This report made use of FBI resources and incorporated the views of several experienced pathologists; it concluded: "The overwhelming weight of the evidence compels the conclusion ... that Vincent Foster committed suicide in Fort Marcy Park on July 20, 1993."[24]
3 and 4. Two investigations by the U.S. Congress found that Foster committed suicide:[15]
One was by Representative William F. Clinger Jr. from Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, who reached this conclusion in a finding published on August 12, 1994.[24]
The other was by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, wherein both the majority Democratic and minority Republican reports reached the same conclusion in reports issued on January 3, 1995.[24]
Theories of a cover-up persisted, however,[25] some of which were promulgated by the Arkansas Project.[26] The speculation and conspiracy theories featured on talk radio and elsewhere caused pain to the Foster family.[1]
5. After a three-year investigation, Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr[25] released a report on October 10, 1997, also concluding that the death was a suicide.[15][27] In response, Sheila Foster Anthony, Vince Foster's sister, said she agreed with Starr's findings but criticized his investigation for having taken so long, thus contributing to the existence of "ridiculous conspiracy theories proffered by those with a profit or political motive".[27]
Legacy[edit]
Foster's death, occurring just six months into the new administration, is thought by some to have ended the optimism and remaining innocence of the White House staff.[28] White House chief of staff and childhood friend Mack McLarty said that "It was a deep cut. It clearly had a tremendous impact."[28] Nussbaum speculated that if Foster had lived, he would have helped resist the calls to appoint independent counsels and the many investigations lumped under the Whitewater umbrella that occupied the administration and Clinton for the rest of his presidency might not have happened.[28] As it did happen, how Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, Maggie Williams, in particular handled Foster's files and documents immediately after his death became an issue of much investigation itself.[15][29]
Years later, Bill Clinton expressed his continued anger about the Foster rumors and theories, clenching a fist as he spoke: "I heard a lot of the right-wing talk show people ... and all the sleazy stuff they said. They didn't give a rip that he had killed himself or that his family was miserable or that they could break the hearts [of Foster's friends and family]. It was just another weapon to slug us with, to dehumanize us with."[18]
Foster's passing also had an effect on Rose Law Firm, as many within the firm had expected Foster to become its leader once he returned from service in Washington.[12] As one partner later said, "In meetings of the partners, he didn't often take a vocal stand. ... But when he did, it almost always swayed the firm. When he left for Washington, people here spoke openly about the emotional vacuum."[6] Colleagues speculated that Foster might have someday become president of the state bar association or a choice for a federal judgeship.[3]
Beginning in 1993, the Vince Foster, Jr., Outstanding Lawyer Award was given out annually by the Pulaski County Bar Association to recognize members who contributed to the bar and advanced the legal profession.[30] An endowed chair at the University of Arkansas School of Law, the Vincent Foster University Professor of Legal Ethics and Professional Responsibility, was created in his name.[7] In 2015 a holder of the chair, Howard W. Brill, was appointed Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court.

Vincent Walker "Vince" Foster Jr. (January 15, 1945 – July 20, 1993) was a Deputy White House Counsel during the first half-year of President Bill Clinton's administration. Prior to that, he was a partner at Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he was a colleague and friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton and where, as The Washington Post later wrote, he rose to "the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment."[1] At the White House he was unhappy with work in politics and spiraled into depression. His death by gunshot was attributed by five official or governmental investigations to suicide but several conspiracy theories emerged.

Early life[edit]
Foster was born in Hope, Arkansas, to Alice Mae and Vincent W. Foster.[2] His father became prosperous from real estate sales and development.[3][4] Vincent had two sisters, Sheila and Sharon.[2] He was a childhood neighbor and friend of Bill Clinton for four of the first five years of his life, until Clinton moved away. As Clinton later recalled, "I lived with my grandparents in a modest little house across from Vince Foster's nice, big, white brick house."[5] Another childhood friend was Mack McLarty, who would one day become White House Chief of Staff for Clinton.[6]
Foster excelled as a student and athlete.[5] At Hope High School, he became president of the student council, with McLarty as vice president.[6] He graduated from there in 1963.[2]

Subsequent investigations[edit]
Five official or governmental investigations into Foster's death all concluded that he committed suicide.[23]
1. The first was by the United States Park Police in 1993, in whose jurisdiction the original investigation fell.[24] Because of Foster's position in the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation assisted in the investigation, as did several other state and federal agencies.[24] The result of this investigation was released as a joint report from the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Park Police on August 10, 1993, and it stated: "The condition of the scene, the medical examiner's findings and the information gathered clearly indicate that Mr. Foster committed suicide."[24]
2. Investigations by a coroner and Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske, in a 58-page report released on June 30, 1994, also concluded that Foster had committed suicide.[15] This report made use of FBI resources and incorporated the views of several experienced pathologists; it concluded: "The overwhelming weight of the evidence compels the conclusion ... that Vincent Foster committed suicide in Fort Marcy Park on July 20, 1993."[24]
3 and 4. Two investigations by the U.S. Congress found that Foster committed suicide:[15]
One was by Representative William F. Clinger Jr. from Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, who reached this conclusion in a finding published on August 12, 1994.[24]
The other was by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, wherein both the majority Democratic and minority Republican reports reached the same conclusion in reports issued on January 3, 1995.[24]
Theories of a cover-up persisted, however,[25] some of which were promulgated by the Arkansas Project.[26] The speculation and conspiracy theories featured on talk radio and elsewhere caused pain to the Foster family.[1]
5. After a three-year investigation, Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr[25] released a report on October 10, 1997, also concluding that the death was a suicide.[15][27] In response, Sheila Foster Anthony, Vince Foster's sister, said she agreed with Starr's findings but criticized his investigation for having taken so long, thus contributing to the existence of "ridiculous conspiracy theories proffered by those with a profit or political motive".[27]
Legacy[edit]
Foster's death, occurring just six months into the new administration, is thought by some to have ended the optimism and remaining innocence of the White House staff.[28] White House chief of staff and childhood friend Mack McLarty said that "It was a deep cut. It clearly had a tremendous impact."[28] Nussbaum speculated that if Foster had lived, he would have helped resist the calls to appoint independent counsels and the many investigations lumped under the Whitewater umbrella that occupied the administration and Clinton for the rest of his presidency might not have happened.[28] As it did happen, how Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, Maggie Williams, in particular handled Foster's files and documents immediately after his death became an issue of much investigation itself.[15][29]
Years later, Bill Clinton expressed his continued anger about the Foster rumors and theories, clenching a fist as he spoke: "I heard a lot of the right-wing talk show people ... and all the sleazy stuff they said. They didn't give a rip that he had killed himself or that his family was miserable or that they could break the hearts [of Foster's friends and family]. It was just another weapon to slug us with, to dehumanize us with."[18]
Foster's passing also had an effect on Rose Law Firm, as many within the firm had expected Foster to become its leader once he returned from service in Washington.[12] As one partner later said, "In meetings of the partners, he didn't often take a vocal stand. ... But when he did, it almost always swayed the firm. When he left for Washington, people here spoke openly about the emotional vacuum."[6] Colleagues speculated that Foster might have someday become president of the state bar association or a choice for a federal judgeship.[3]
Beginning in 1993, the Vince Foster, Jr., Outstanding Lawyer Award was given out annually by the Pulaski County Bar Association to recognize members who contributed to the bar and advanced the legal profession.[30] An endowed chair at the University of Arkansas School of Law, the Vincent Foster University Professor of Legal Ethics and Professional Responsibility, was created in his name.[7] In 2015 a holder of the chair, Howard W. Brill, was appointed Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court.

Vincent Walker "Vince" Foster Jr. (January 15, 1945 – July 20, 1993) was a Deputy White House Counsel during the first half-year of President Bill Clinton's administration. Prior to that, he was a partner at Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he was a colleague and friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton and where, as The Washington Post later wrote, he rose to "the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment."[1] At the White House he was unhappy with work in politics and spiraled into depression. His death by gunshot was attributed by five official or governmental investigations to suicide but several conspiracy theories emerged.

Early life[edit]
Foster was born in Hope, Arkansas, to Alice Mae and Vincent W. Foster.[2] His father became prosperous from real estate sales and development.[3][4] Vincent had two sisters, Sheila and Sharon.[2] He was a childhood neighbor and friend of Bill Clinton for four of the first five years of his life, until Clinton moved away. As Clinton later recalled, "I lived with my grandparents in a modest little house across from Vince Foster's nice, big, white brick house."[5] Another childhood friend was Mack McLarty, who would one day become White House Chief of Staff for Clinton.[6]
Foster excelled as a student and athlete.[5] At Hope High School, he became president of the student council, with McLarty as vice president.[6] He graduated from there in 1963.[2]
Foster attended Davidson College, graduating with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1967.[4][7] His father wanted him to join the family real estate business, but he instead chose law.[3]
After starting at Vanderbilt University Law School, he joined the Arkansas National Guard during the height of the Vietnam War[3] to avoid the military draft.[4] To be closer to his guard responsibilities, he transferred to the University of Arkansas School of Law,[3] where he was managing editor of the law review[2] and received his Juris Doctor in 1971, graduating first in his class.[3] He scored the highest in his class on the Arkansas bar exam.[3]
Foster met Elizabeth Braden, known as Lisa, during his sophomore year at Davidson; she was the daughter of an insurance broker from Nashville and was attending Sweet Briar College.[3] They married on April 20, 1968,[8] at St. Henry Catholic Church in Nashville.[3] They had three children: Vincent III, Laura, and John.[3]
Arkansas lawyer[edit]
In 1971, Foster joined Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas,[9] and in 1974 was made partner,[2] one of only nine in the firm at the time.[10] He was the head of the Arkansas Bar Association committee that oversaw legal aid, and as such worked with legal aid clinic worker Hillary Rodham in successfully overcoming an unreasonable measuring requirement for indigent clients.[9] Foster then initiated the hiring of Rodham at Rose Law Firm, where she became its first ever female associate[9] (and later first female partner); Foster and fellow partner Webster Hubbell were instrumental in overcoming the reluctance of other partners to hire a woman.[10] Foster and Rodham worked together on a number of cases.[7]




Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, where Foster worked for two decades


Foster practiced mostly corporate law,[11] eventually earning nearly $300,000 a year.[11] Known for his extensive preparation of cases ahead of time, including the creation of decision trees,[6] Foster developed a reputation as one of the best trial litigators in Arkansas.[7] Hillary Clinton's memoirs call Foster "one of the best lawyers I've ever known," and compared him in style and substance to Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch in the classic 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird.[9] Writer Carl Bernstein has described Foster as "tall, with impeccable manners and a formal mien ... elegant in perfectly tailored suits, and soft-spoken to the point of taciturnity."[10] Writer Dan Moldea characterized him as "a 'can-do' lawyer who worked best when under pressure."[4] Phillip Carroll, the leading litigator at Rose Law Firm, once said of Foster, "He was my ideal of a young lawyer."[12] The ABA Journal reported that Foster was "acknowledged by many as the soul of the firm".[12]
He appeared to experience only success at Rose Law; a partner later said, "I never saw a professional setback. Never. Not even a tiny one."[11] The firm grew five times its size during his time there.[6] The Arkansas Bar Association gave him a number of awards[5] and in June 1993 would name him as its Outstanding Lawyer of the Year.[4] He was also listed in the Best Lawyers in America book.[6] His wife Lisa described him as driven to prevail, staying up around the clock to prepare for big cases, believing he would lose the case even though he rarely did; she later viewed this as an early sign of depressed behavior.[3]
By 1992, Vince Foster was, as The Washington Post later wrote, at "the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment."[1] He was also an established figure in Little Rock society, serving as the chair of the board of the Arkansas Repertory Theatre and belonging to the exclusive Country Club of Little Rock.[6]
White House Counsel[edit]
After Clinton's 1992 election, Foster joined Clinton's presidential transition team.[6] Once Clinton was inaugurated, Foster joined his White House staff as Deputy White House Counsel in early 1993.[2] This was despite Foster's initial reluctance to leave his Little Rock life behind and come to Washington.[3][6] There he worked under the White House Counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum, although Nussbaum would consider the pair to be "co-senior partners".[6] He was also joined with two other Rose Law Firm partners: William H. Kennedy, III, who served as his associate counsel, and Webster Hubbell, who became Associate Attorney General.[13] The Foster residence was a small rented house in Georgetown in Washington, D.C.[6]
Foster had difficulty making the transition to life and politics in Washington.[1] Unlike some other Clinton-associated figures, he had had no experience with campaigns or politics at all.[6] His wife and youngest son were not with him, having stayed behind in Arkansas so the son could complete his senior year of high school at Catholic High in Little Rock.[6][14] His initial role was in vetting potential administration appointees, and in this he was one of the key figures in the transition.[6] As one subject of the vetting process later said, "I wondered why I was being interviewed by the guy who would be deputy counsel. Seemed his job was to find out how honest I was, and what level of ego I was bringing. It's a measure of how much the Clintons trusted him."[6] But Foster found this involvement in vetting appointments to be causing him depression and anxiety.[1] In particular, he blamed himself for the failed Zoë Baird nomination;[1] he had thought that Baird had been justified in following her lawyer's advice regarding the payment of taxes on household employees, but he had failed to anticipate the political backlash that led to it becoming known as "Nannygate" and that blemished the early days of the administration.[6] The equally unsuccessful Kimba Wood and Lani Guinier appointments were also under Foster's purview.[15] He had to resign from the Country Club of Little Rock once its all-white membership became a political issue for others in the administration.[6]
As Deputy Counsel, Foster was also involved in a range of other matters, including preparation of executive orders, analyzing the legal effect of various policies, examining international treaties, discussing the ramifications of authorizations for use of military force, and authorizing expenditures within the White House.[6] Foster worked on placing the Clintons' financial holdings into a blind trust.[6]
He handled the Clintons' Madison Guaranty and Industrial Development Corporation paperwork[16] and also several Whitewater-related tax returns.[17] He worked twelve-hour days, six or seven days a week, and although thin to begin with, began losing weight.[6][18]
On May 8, 1993, Foster gave the commencement address at his University of Arkansas Law School alma mater, and said:

The reputation you develop for intellectual and ethical integrity will be your greatest asset or your worst enemy. You will be judged by your judgment. ... Treat every pleading, every brief, every contract, every letter, every daily task as if your career will be judged on it... There is no victory, no advantage, no fee, no favor, which is worth even a blemish on your reputation for intellect and integrity. ... Dents to the reputation in the legal profession are irreparable."[14][6]

One faculty member listening to it recalled telling another that it was "the most depressing graduation speech I had ever heard, in both content and manner."[18] A friend of Foster's has said, "Look, it's just crazy, right? You get one dent and it can never be fixed? In Washington, you get them all the time. You get twenty dents and you go to the body shop. Vince couldn't see that, apparently."[6]
Four days after the speech, the White House travel office controversy erupted.[14][6] Foster was the target of several hostile Wall Street Journal editorials in June and July 1993,[1] with titles such as "Who is Vincent Foster?"[11] He became quite upset over the travel office matter and the possibility of a congressional hearing[1] at which he might have been called to testify.[15] Disliking the public spotlight[11] and suffering from continued weight loss and insomnia,[1] he considered resigning his position but feared a personal humiliation upon returning to Arkansas.[1]
Death[edit]
Main article: Suicide of Vince Foster




Grave of Vince Foster at Memory Gardens Cemetery in his boyhood home of Hope


Struggling with depression,[11][1] which after his death was assessed as clinical depression,[19] Foster was prescribed the anti-depressant medication trazodone over the phone by his Arkansas doctor, starting with a low initial dosage.[11] The next day, Foster was found dead in Fort Marcy Park, a federal park in Virginia. An autopsy determined that he was shot in the mouth and no other wounds were found on his body.[20]
A draft resignation letter was found torn into 27 pieces in his briefcase. The letter contained a list of grievances, including, "The WSJ editors lie without consequence"[21] and saying, "I was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life in Washington. Here ruining people is considered sport."
His funeral mass was held at the Cathedral of St. Andrew Catholic Church in Little Rock.[7] Bill Clinton gave a eulogy in which he recalled their boyhood times together and quoted a line from Leon Russell's "A Song for You": "I love you in a place that has no space and time."[22]
Foster was buried in Memory Gardens Cemetery in his hometown of Hope. Foster was 48 years old and was survived by his wife and three children.

2. Investigations by a coroner and Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske, in a 58-page report released on June 30, 1994, also concluded that Foster had committed suicide.[15] This report made use of FBI resources and incorporated the views of several experienced pathologists; it concluded: "The overwhelming weight of the evidence compels the conclusion ... that Vincent Foster committed suicide in Fort Marcy Park on July 20, 1993."[24]
3 and 4. Two investigations by the U.S. Congress found that Foster committed suicide:[15]

Prior to that, he was a partner at Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he was a colleague and friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton and where, as The Washington Post later wrote, he rose to "the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment."[1] At the White House he was unhappy with work in politics and spiraled into depression. His death by gunshot was attributed by five official or governmental investigations to suicide but several conspiracy theories emerged.

Early life[edit]
Foster was born in Hope, Arkansas, to Alice Mae and Vincent W. Foster.[2] His father became prosperous from real estate sales and development.[3][4] Vincent had two sisters, Sheila and Sharon.[2] He was a childhood neighbor and friend of Bill Clinton for four of the first five years of his life, until Clinton moved away. As Clinton later recalled, "I lived with my grandparents in a modest little house across from Vince Foster's nice, big, white brick house."[5] Another childhood friend was Mack McLarty, who would one day become White House Chief of Staff for Clinton.[6]
Foster excelled as a student and athlete.[5] At Hope High School, he became president of the student council, with McLarty as vice president.[6] He graduated from there in 1963.[2]
Foster attended Davidson College, graduating with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1967.[4][7] His father wanted him to join the family real estate business, but he instead chose law.[3]
After starting at Vanderbilt University Law School, he joined the Arkansas National Guard during the height of the Vietnam War[3] to avoid the military draft.[4] To be closer to his guard responsibilities, he transferred to the University of Arkansas School of Law,[3] where he was managing editor of the law review[2] and received his Juris Doctor in 1971, graduating first in his class.[3] He scored the highest in his class on the Arkansas bar exam.[3]
Foster met Elizabeth Braden, known as Lisa, during his sophomore year at Davidson; she was the daughter of an insurance broker from Nashville and was attending Sweet Briar College.[3] They married on April 20, 1968,[8] at St. Henry Catholic Church in Nashville.[3] They had three children: Vincent III, Laura, and John.[3]
Arkansas lawyer[edit]
In 1971, Foster joined Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas,[9] and in 1974 was made partner,[2] one of only nine in the firm at the time.[10] He was the head of the Arkansas Bar Association committee that oversaw legal aid, and as such worked with legal aid clinic worker Hillary Rodham in successfully overcoming an unreasonable measuring requirement for indigent clients.[9] Foster then initiated the hiring of Rodham at Rose Law Firm, where she became its first ever female associate[9] (and later first female partner); Foster and fellow partner Webster Hubbell were instrumental in overcoming the reluctance of other partners to hire a woman.[10] Foster and Rodham worked together on a number of cases.[7]




Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, where Foster worked for two decades


Foster practiced mostly corporate law,[11] eventually earning nearly $300,000 a year.[11] Known for his extensive preparation of cases ahead of time, including the creation of decision trees,[6] Foster developed a reputation as one of the best trial litigators in Arkansas.[7] Hillary Clinton's memoirs call Foster "one of the best lawyers I've ever known," and compared him in style and substance to Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch in the classic 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird.[9] Writer Carl Bernstein has described Foster as "tall, with impeccable manners and a formal mien ... elegant in perfectly tailored suits, and soft-spoken to the point of taciturnity."[10] Writer Dan Moldea characterized him as "a 'can-do' lawyer who worked best when under pressure."[4] Phillip Carroll, the leading litigator at Rose Law Firm, once said of Foster, "He was my ideal of a young lawyer."[12] The ABA Journal reported that Foster was "acknowledged by many as the soul of the firm".[12]
He appeared to experience only success at Rose Law; a partner later said, "I never saw a professional setback. Never. Not even a tiny one."[11] The firm grew five times its size during his time there.[6] The Arkansas Bar Association gave him a number of awards[5] and in June 1993 would name him as its Outstanding Lawyer of the Year.[4] He was also listed in the Best Lawyers in America book.[6] His wife Lisa described him as driven to prevail, staying up around the clock to prepare for big cases, believing he would lose the case even though he rarely did; she later viewed this as an early sign of depressed behavior.[3]
By 1992, Vince Foster was, as The Washington Post later wrote, at "the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment."[1] He was also an established figure in Little Rock society, serving as the chair of the board of the Arkansas Repertory Theatre and belonging to the exclusive Country Club of Little Rock.[6]
White House Counsel[edit]
After Clinton's 1992 election, Foster joined Clinton's presidential transition team.[6] Once Clinton was inaugurated, Foster joined his White House staff as Deputy White House Counsel in early 1993.[2] This was despite Foster's initial reluctance to leave his Little Rock life behind and come to Washington.[3][6] There he worked under the White House Counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum, although Nussbaum would consider the pair to be "co-senior partners".[6] He was also joined with two other Rose Law Firm partners: William H. Kennedy, III, who served as his associate counsel, and Webster Hubbell, who became Associate Attorney General.[13] The Foster residence was a small rented house in Georgetown in Washington, D.C.[6]
Foster had difficulty making the transition to life and politics in Washington.[1] Unlike some other Clinton-associated figures, he had had no experience with campaigns or politics at all.[6] His wife and youngest son were not with him, having stayed behind in Arkansas so the son could complete his senior year of high school at Catholic High in Little Rock.[6][14] His initial role was in vetting potential administration appointees, and in this he was one of the key figures in the transition.[6] As one subject of the vetting process later said, "I wondered why I was being interviewed by the guy who would be deputy counsel. Seemed his job was to find out how honest I was, and what level of ego I was bringing. It's a measure of how much the Clintons trusted him."[6] But Foster found this involvement in vetting appointments to be causing him depression and anxiety.[1] In particular, he blamed himself for the failed Zoë Baird nomination;[1] he had thought that Baird had been justified in following her lawyer's advice regarding the payment of taxes on household employees, but he had failed to anticipate the political backlash that led to it becoming known as "Nannygate" and that blemished the early days of the administration.[6] The equally unsuccessful Kimba Wood and Lani Guinier appointments were also under Foster's purview.[15] He had to resign from the Country Club of Little Rock once its all-white membership became a political issue for others in the administration.[6]
As Deputy Counsel, Foster was also involved in a range of other matters, including preparation of executive orders, analyzing the legal effect of various policies, examining international treaties, discussing the ramifications of authorizations for use of military force, and authorizing expenditures within the White House.[6] Foster worked on placing the Clintons' financial holdings into a blind trust.[6]
He handled the Clintons' Madison Guaranty and Industrial Development Corporation paperwork[16] and also several Whitewater-related tax returns.[17] He worked twelve-hour days, six or seven days a week, and although thin to begin with, began losing weight.[6][18]
On May 8, 1993, Foster gave the commencement address at his University of Arkansas Law School alma mater, and said:

The reputation you develop for intellectual and ethical integrity will be your greatest asset or your worst enemy. You will be judged by your judgment. ... Treat every pleading, every brief, every contract, every letter, every daily task as if your career will be judged on it... There is no victory, no advantage, no fee, no favor, which is worth even a blemish on your reputation for intellect and integrity. ... Dents to the reputation in the legal profession are irreparable."[14][6]

One faculty member listening to it recalled telling another that it was "the most depressing graduation speech I had ever heard, in both content and manner."[18] A friend of Foster's has said, "Look, it's just crazy, right? You get one dent and it can never be fixed? In Washington, you get them all the time. You get twenty dents and you go to the body shop. Vince couldn't see that, apparently."[6]
Four days after the speech, the White House travel office controversy erupted.[14][6] Foster was the target of several hostile Wall Street Journal editorials in June and July 1993,[1] with titles such as "Who is Vincent Foster?"[11] He became quite upset over the travel office matter and the possibility of a congressional hearing[1] at which he might have been called to testify.[15] Disliking the public spotlight[11] and suffering from continued weight loss and insomnia,[1] he considered resigning his position but feared a personal humiliation upon returning to Arkansas.[1]
Death[edit]
Main article: Suicide of Vince Foster




Grave of Vince Foster at Memory Gardens Cemetery in his boyhood home of Hope


Struggling with depression,[11][1] which after his death was assessed as clinical depression,[19] Foster was prescribed the anti-depressant medication trazodone over the phone by his Arkansas doctor, starting with a low initial dosage.[11] The next day, Foster was found dead in Fort Marcy Park, a federal park in Virginia. An autopsy determined that he was shot in the mouth and no other wounds were found on his body.[20]
A draft resignation letter was found torn into 27 pieces in his briefcase. The letter contained a list of grievances, including, "The WSJ editors lie without consequence"[21] and saying, "I was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life in Washington. Here ruining people is considered sport."
His funeral mass was held at the Cathedral of St. Andrew Catholic Church in Little Rock.[7] Bill Clinton gave a eulogy in which he recalled their boyhood times together and quoted a line from Leon Russell's "A Song for You": "I love you in a place that has no space and time."[22]
Foster was buried in Memory Gardens Cemetery in his hometown of Hope. Foster was 48 years old and was survived by his wife and three children.
Subsequent investigations[edit]
Five official or governmental investigations into Foster's death all concluded that he committed suicide.[23]
1. The first was by the United States Park Police in 1993, in whose jurisdiction the original investigation fell.[24] Because of Foster's position in the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation assisted in the investigation, as did several other state and federal agencies.[24] The result of this investigation was released as a joint report from the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Park Police on August 10, 1993, and it stated: "The condition of the scene, the medical examiner's findings and the information gathered clearly indicate that Mr. Foster committed suicide."[24]
2. Investigations by a coroner and Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske, in a 58-page report released on June 30, 1994, also concluded that Foster had committed suicide.[15] This report made use of FBI resources and incorporated the views of several experienced pathologists; it concluded: "The overwhelming weight of the evidence compels the conclusion ... that Vincent Foster committed suicide in Fort Marcy Park on July 20, 1993."[24]
3 and 4. Two investigations by the U.S. Congress found that Foster committed suicide:[15]
One was by Representative William F. Clinger Jr. from Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, who reached this conclusion in a finding published on August 12, 1994.[24]
The other was by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, wherein both the majority Democratic and minority Republican reports reached the same conclusion in reports issued on January 3, 1995.[24]
Theories of a cover-up persisted, however,[25] some of which were promulgated by the Arkansas Project.[26] The speculation and conspiracy theories featured on talk radio and elsewhere caused pain to the Foster family.[1]
5. After a three-year investigation, Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr[25] released a report on October 10, 1997, also concluding that the death was a suicide.[15][27] In response, Sheila Foster Anthony, Vince Foster's sister, said she agreed with Starr's findings but criticized his investigation for having taken so long, thus contributing to the existence of "ridiculous conspiracy theories proffered by those with a profit or political motive".[27]
Legacy[edit]
Foster's death, occurring just six months into the new administration, is thought by some to have ended the optimism and remaining innocence of the White House staff.[28] White House chief of staff and childhood friend Mack McLarty said that "It was a deep cut. It clearly had a tremendous impact."[28] Nussbaum speculated that if Foster had lived, he would have helped resist the calls to appoint independent counsels and the many investigations lumped under the Whitewater umbrella that occupied the administration and Clinton for the rest of his presidency might not have happened.[28] As it did happen, how Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, Maggie Williams, in particular handled Foster's files and documents immediately after his death became an issue of much investigation itself.[15][29]
Years later, Bill Clinton expressed his continued anger about the Foster rumors and theories, clenching a fist as he spoke: "I heard a lot of the right-wing talk show people ... and all the sleazy stuff they said. They didn't give a rip that he had killed himself or that his family was miserable or that they could break the hearts [of Foster's friends and family]. It was just another weapon to slug us with, to dehumanize us with."[18]
Foster's passing also had an effect on Rose Law Firm, as many within the firm had expected Foster to become its leader once he returned from service in Washington.[12] As one partner later said, "In meetings of the partners, he didn't often take a vocal stand. ... But when he did, it almost always swayed the firm. When he left for Washington, people here spoke openly about the emotional vacuum."[6] Colleagues speculated that Foster might have someday become president of the state bar association or a choice for a federal judgeship.[3]
Beginning in 1993, the Vince Foster, Jr., Outstanding Lawyer Award was given out annually by the Pulaski County Bar Association to recognize members who contributed to the bar and advanced the legal profession.[30] An endowed chair at the University of Arkansas School of Law, the Vincent Foster University Professor of Legal Ethics and Professional Responsibility, was created in his name.[7] In 2015 a holder of the chair, Howard W. Brill, was appointed Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court.

Early life[edit]
Foster was born in Hope, Arkansas, to Alice Mae and Vincent W. Foster.[2] His father became prosperous from real estate sales and development.[3][4] Vincent had two sisters, Sheila and Sharon.[2] He was a childhood neighbor and friend of Bill Clinton for four of the first five years of his life, until Clinton moved away. As Clinton later recalled, "I lived with my grandparents in a modest little house across from Vince Foster's nice, big, white brick house."[5] Another childhood friend was Mack McLarty, who would one day become White House Chief of Staff for Clinton.[6]
Foster excelled as a student and athlete.[5] At Hope High School, he became president of the student council, with McLarty as vice president.[6] He graduated from there in 1963.[2]

Foster practiced mostly corporate law,[11] eventually earning nearly $300,000 a year.[11] Known for his extensive preparation of cases ahead of time, including the creation of decision trees,[6] Foster developed a reputation as one of the best trial litigators in Arkansas.[7] Hillary Clinton's memoirs call Foster "one of the best lawyers I've ever known," and compared him in style and substance to Gregory Peck's portrayal of Atticus Finch in the classic 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird.[9] Writer Carl Bernstein has described Foster as "tall, with impeccable manners and a formal mien ... elegant in perfectly tailored suits, and soft-spoken to the point of taciturnity."[10] Writer Dan Moldea characterized him as "a 'can-do' lawyer who worked best when under pressure."[4] Phillip Carroll, the leading litigator at Rose Law Firm, once said of Foster, "He was my ideal of a young lawyer."[12] The ABA Journal reported that Foster was "acknowledged by many as the soul of the firm".[12]
He appeared to experience only success at Rose Law; a partner later said, "I never saw a professional setback. Never. Not even a tiny one."[11] The firm grew five times its size during his time there.[6] The Arkansas Bar Association gave him a number of awards[5] and in June 1993 would name him as its Outstanding Lawyer of the Year.[4] He was also listed in the Best Lawyers in America book.[6] His wife Lisa described him as driven to prevail, staying up around the clock to prepare for big cases, believing he would lose the case even though he rarely did; she later viewed this as an early sign of depressed behavior.[3]
By 1992, Vince Foster was, as The Washington Post later wrote, at "the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment."[1] He was also an established figure in Little Rock society, serving as the chair of the board of the Arkansas Repertory Theatre and belonging to the exclusive Country Club of Little Rock.[6]
White House Counsel[edit]
After Clinton's 1992 election, Foster joined Clinton's presidential transition team.[6] Once Clinton was inaugurated, Foster joined his White House staff as Deputy White House Counsel in early 1993.[2] This was despite Foster's initial reluctance to leave his Little Rock life behind and come to Washington.[3][6] There he worked under the White House Counsel, Bernard W. Nussbaum, although Nussbaum would consider the pair to be "co-senior partners".[6] He was also joined with two other Rose Law Firm partners: William H. Kennedy, III, who served as his associate counsel, and Webster Hubbell, who became Associate Attorney General.[13] The Foster residence was a small rented house in Georgetown in Washington, D.C.[6]
Foster had difficulty making the transition to life and politics in Washington.[1] Unlike some other Clinton-associated figures, he had had no experience with campaigns or politics at all.[6] His wife and youngest son were not with him, having stayed behind in Arkansas so the son could complete his senior year of high school at Catholic High in Little Rock.[6][14] His initial role was in vetting potential administration appointees, and in this he was one of the key figures in the transition.[6] As one subject of the vetting process later said, "I wondered why I was being interviewed by the guy who would be deputy counsel. Seemed his job was to find out how honest I was, and what level of ego I was bringing. It's a measure of how much the Clintons trusted him."[6] But Foster found this involvement in vetting appointments to be causing him depression and anxiety.[1] In particular, he blamed himself for the failed Zoë Baird nomination;[1] he had thought that Baird had been justified in following her lawyer's advice regarding the payment of taxes on household employees, but he had failed to anticipate the political backlash that led to it becoming known as "Nannygate" and that blemished the early days of the administration.[6] The equally unsuccessful Kimba Wood and Lani Guinier appointments were also under Foster's purview.[15] He had to resign from the Country Club of Little Rock once its all-white membership became a political issue for others in the administration.[6]
As Deputy Counsel, Foster was also involved in a range of other matters, including preparation of executive orders, analyzing the legal effect of various policies, examining international treaties, discussing the ramifications of authorizations for use of military force, and authorizing expenditures within the White House.[6] Foster worked on placing the Clintons' financial holdings into a blind trust.[6]
He handled the Clintons' Madison Guaranty and Industrial Development Corporation paperwork[16] and also several Whitewater-related tax returns.[17] He worked twelve-hour days, six or seven days a week, and although thin to begin with, began losing weight.[6][18]
On May 8, 1993, Foster gave the commencement address at his University of Arkansas Law School alma mater, and said:

The reputation you develop for intellectual and ethical integrity will be your greatest asset or your worst enemy. You will be judged by your judgment. ... Treat every pleading, every brief, every contract, every letter, every daily task as if your career will be judged on it... There is no victory, no advantage, no fee, no favor, which is worth even a blemish on your reputation for intellect and integrity. ... Dents to the reputation in the legal profession are irreparable."[14][6]

One faculty member listening to it recalled telling another that it was "the most depressing graduation speech I had ever heard, in both content and manner."[18] A friend of Foster's has said, "Look, it's just crazy, right? You get one dent and it can never be fixed? In Washington, you get them all the time. You get twenty dents and you go to the body shop. Vince couldn't see that, apparently."[6]
Four days after the speech, the White House travel office controversy erupted.[14][6] Foster was the target of several hostile Wall Street Journal editorials in June and July 1993,[1] with titles such as "Who is Vincent Foster?"[11] He became quite upset over the travel office matter and the possibility of a congressional hearing[1] at which he might have been called to testify.[15] Disliking the public spotlight[11] and suffering from continued weight loss and insomnia,[1] he considered resigning his position but feared a personal humiliation upon returning to Arkansas.[1]
Death[edit]
Main article: Suicide of Vince Foster

Struggling with depression,[11][1] which after his death was assessed as clinical depression,[19] Foster was prescribed the anti-depressant medication trazodone over the phone by his Arkansas doctor, starting with a low initial dosage.[11] The next day, Foster was found dead in Fort Marcy Park, a federal park in Virginia. An autopsy determined that he was shot in the mouth and no other wounds were found on his body.[20]
A draft resignation letter was found torn into 27 pieces in his briefcase. The letter contained a list of grievances, including, "The WSJ editors lie without consequence"[21] and saying, "I was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life in Washington. Here ruining people is considered sport."
His funeral mass was held at the Cathedral of St. Andrew Catholic Church in Little Rock.[7] Bill Clinton gave a eulogy in which he recalled their boyhood times together and quoted a line from Leon Russell's "A Song for You": "I love you in a place that has no space and time."[22]
Foster was buried in Memory Gardens Cemetery in his hometown of Hope. Foster was 48 years old and was survived by his wife and three children.
Subsequent investigations[edit]
Five official or governmental investigations into Foster's death all concluded that he committed suicide.[23]
1. The first was by the United States Park Police in 1993, in whose jurisdiction the original investigation fell.[24] Because of Foster's position in the White House, the Federal Bureau of Investigation assisted in the investigation, as did several other state and federal agencies.[24] The result of this investigation was released as a joint report from the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Park Police on August 10, 1993, and it stated: "The condition of the scene, the medical examiner's findings and the information gathered clearly indicate that Mr. Foster committed suicide."[24]
2. Investigations by a coroner and Independent Counsel Robert B. Fiske, in a 58-page report released on June 30, 1994, also concluded that Foster had committed suicide.[15] This report made use of FBI resources and incorporated the views of several experienced pathologists; it concluded: "The overwhelming weight of the evidence compels the conclusion ... that Vincent Foster committed suicide in Fort Marcy Park on July 20, 1993."[24]
3 and 4. Two investigations by the U.S. Congress found that Foster committed suicide:[15]
One was by Representative William F. Clinger Jr. from Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, who reached this conclusion in a finding published on August 12, 1994.[24]
The other was by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, wherein both the majority Democratic and minority Republican reports reached the same conclusion in reports issued on January 3, 1995.[24]
Theories of a cover-up persisted, however,[25] some of which were promulgated by the Arkansas Project.[26] The speculation and conspiracy theories featured on talk radio and elsewhere caused pain to the Foster family.[1]
5. After a three-year investigation, Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr[25] released a report on October 10, 1997, also concluding that the death was a suicide.[15][27] In response, Sheila Foster Anthony, Vince Foster's sister, said she agreed with Starr's findings but criticized his investigation for having taken so long, thus contributing to the existence of "ridiculous conspiracy theories proffered by those with a profit or political motive".[27]
Legacy[edit]
Foster's death, occurring just six months into the new administration, is thought by some to have ended the optimism and remaining innocence of the White House staff.[28] White House chief of staff and childhood friend Mack McLarty said that "It was a deep cut. It clearly had a tremendous impact."[28] Nussbaum speculated that if Foster had lived, he would have helped resist the calls to appoint independent counsels and the many investigations lumped under the Whitewater umbrella that occupied the administration and Clinton for the rest of his presidency might not have happened.[28] As it did happen, how Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, Maggie Williams, in particular handled Foster's files and documents immediately after his death became an issue of much investigation itself.[15][29]
Years later, Bill Clinton expressed his continued anger about the Foster rumors and theories, clenching a fist as he spoke: "I heard a lot of the right-wing talk show people ... and all the sleazy stuff they said. They didn't give a rip that he had killed himself or that his family was miserable or that they could break the hearts [of Foster's friends and family]. It was just another weapon to slug us with, to dehumanize us with."[18]
Foster's passing also had an effect on Rose Law Firm, as many within the firm had expected Foster to become its leader once he returned from service in Washington.[12] As one partner later said, "In meetings of the partners, he didn't often take a vocal stand. ... But when he did, it almost always swayed the firm. When he left for Washington, people here spoke openly about the emotional vacuum."[6] Colleagues speculated that Foster might have someday become president of the state bar association or a choice for a federal judgeship.[3]
Beginning in 1993, the Vince Foster, Jr., Outstanding Lawyer Award was given out annually by the Pulaski County Bar Association to recognize members who contributed to the bar and advanced the legal profession.[30] An endowed chair at the University of Arkansas School of Law, the Vincent Foster University Professor of Legal Ethics and Professional Responsibility, was created in his name.[7] In 2015 a holder of the chair, Howard W. Brill, was appointed Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court.

Vincent Walker "Vince" Foster Jr. (January 15, 1945 – July 20, 1993) was a Deputy White House Counsel during the first half-year of President Bill Clinton's administration. Prior to that, he was a partner at Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas, where he was a colleague and friend of Hillary Rodham Clinton and where, as The Washington Post later wrote, he rose to "the pinnacle of the Arkansas legal establishment."[1] At the White House he was unhappy with work in politics and spiraled into depression. His death by gunshot was attributed by five official or governmental investigations to suicide but several conspiracy theories emerged.

Early life[edit]
Foster was born in Hope, Arkansas, to Alice Mae and Vincent W. Foster.[2] His father became prosperous from real estate sales and development.[3][4] Vincent had two sisters, Sheila and Sharon.[2] He was a childhood neighbor and friend of Bill Clinton for four of the first five years of his life, until Clinton moved away. As Clinton later recalled, "I lived with my grandparents in a modest little house across from Vince Foster's nice, big, white brick house."[5] Another childhood friend was Mack McLarty, who would one day become White House Chief of Staff for Clinton.[6]
Foster excelled as a student and athlete.[5] At Hope High School, he became president of the student council, with McLarty as vice president.[6] He graduated from there in 1963.[2]
Foster attended Davidson College, graduating with a bachelor's degree in psychology in 1967.[4][7] His father wanted him to join the family real estate business, but he instead chose law.[3]
After starting at Vanderbilt University Law School, he joined the Arkansas National Guard during the height of the Vietnam War[3] to avoid the military draft.[4] To be closer to his guard responsibilities, he transferred to the University of Arkansas School of Law,[3] where he was managing editor of the law review[2] and received his Juris Doctor in 1971, graduating first in his class.[3] He scored the highest in his class on the Arkansas bar exam.[3]
Foster met Elizabeth Braden, known as Lisa, during his sophomore year at Davidson; she was the daughter of an insurance broker from Nashville and was attending Sweet Briar College.[3] They married on April 20, 1968,[8] at St. Henry Catholic Church in Nashville.[3] They had three children: Vincent III, Laura, and John.[3]
Arkansas lawyer[edit]
In 1971, Foster joined Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Arkansas,[9] and in 1974 was made partner,[2] one of only nine in the firm at the time.[10] He was the head of the Arkansas Bar Association committee that oversaw legal aid, and as such worked with legal aid clinic worker Hillary Rodham in successfully overcoming an unreasonable measuring requirement for indigent clients.[9] Foster then initiated the hiring of Rodham at Rose Law Firm, where she became its first ever female associate[9] (and later first female partner); Foster and fellow partner Webster Hubbell were instrumental in overcoming the reluctance of other partners to hire a woman.[10] Foster and Rodham worked together on a number of cases.[7]

One was by Representative William F. Clinger Jr. from Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, who reached this conclusion in a finding published on August 12, 1994.[24]
The other was by the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, wherein both the majority Democratic and minority Republican reports reached the same conclusion in reports issued on January 3, 1995.[24]
Theories of a cover-up persisted, however,[25] some of which were promulgated by the Arkansas Project.[26] The speculation and conspiracy theories featured on talk radio and elsewhere caused pain to the Foster family.[1]
5. After a three-year investigation, Whitewater independent counsel Ken Starr[25] released a report on October 10, 1997, also concluding that the death was a suicide.[15][27] In response, Sheila Foster Anthony, Vince Foster's sister, said she agreed with Starr's findings but criticized his investigation for having taken so long, thus contributing to the existence of "ridiculous conspiracy theories proffered by those with a profit or political motive".[27]
Legacy[edit]
Foster's death, occurring just six months into the new administration, is thought by some to have ended the optimism and remaining innocence of the White House staff.[28] White House chief of staff and childhood friend Mack McLarty said that "It was a deep cut. It clearly had a tremendous impact."[28] Nussbaum speculated that if Foster had lived, he would have helped resist the calls to appoint independent counsels and the many investigations lumped under the Whitewater umbrella that occupied the administration and Clinton for the rest of his presidency might not have happened.[28] As it did happen, how Hillary Clinton's chief of staff, Maggie Williams, in particular handled Foster's files and documents immediately after his death became an issue of much investigation itself.[15][29]
Years later, Bill Clinton expressed his continued anger about the Foster rumors and theories, clenching a fist as he spoke: "I heard a lot of the right-wing talk show people ... and all the sleazy stuff they said. They didn't give a rip that he had killed himself or that his family was miserable or that they could break the hearts [of Foster's friends and family]. It was just another weapon to slug us with, to dehumanize us with."[18]
Foster's passing also had an effect on Rose Law Firm, as many within the firm had expected Foster to become its leader once he returned from service in Washington.[12] As one partner later said, "In meetings of the partners, he didn't often take a vocal stand. ... But when he did, it almost always swayed the firm. When he left for Washington, people here spoke openly about the emotional vacuum."[6] Colleagues speculated that Foster might have someday become president of the state bar association or a choice for a federal judgeship.[3]
Beginning in 1993, the Vince Foster, Jr., Outstanding Lawyer Award was given out annually by the Pulaski County Bar Association to recognize members who contributed to the bar and advanced the legal profession.[30] An endowed chair at the University of Arkansas School of Law, the Vincent Foster University Professor of Legal Ethics and Professional Responsibility, was created in his name.[7] In 2015 a holder of the chair, Howard W. Brill, was appointed Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court.

The Death of Vincent Foster
                 By Michael Rivero


Evidence Of A Cover-up

INTRODUCTION
This is the story that nobody dares touch. This is the story that ended my career in Hollywood back in 1994.
Despite having reported the discovery of Dr. Haut's signed report
confirming the existence of a second wound to Vincent Foster's neck, radio
host Rush Limbaugh to this very day refers to Vincent Foster's death as
a suicide.
Even Matt Drudge, when presented with the FBI records proving that
the FBI fraudulently manufactured Lisa Foster's recognition of the gun
found at Fort Marcy Park, refused to get involved, opting instead for a
story accusing Sidney Blumenthal of domestic violence (for which Drudge
was then sued and made famous).

UPDATE NOVEMBER 2014Courtesy of a reader in Toronto.

 It only took them twenty years to catch up with me, but it is nice to see!  So, what would had happened if Rush Limbuagh and Matt Druge, not to mention ABCNNBBCBS had had the courage to report this story back in 1994? I would have kept my film career, of course, but beyond that, we might have avoided three Presidential administrations convinced that they could do whatever they wanted to do and get away with it, whether it was murdering the White House Deputy Council, lying about Saddam's nuclear weapons to start a war of conquest, or scamming us all with 9-11, or human-caused global warming, Obamacare, etc. There is a funny line in the first
"Men in Black" movie where Agent K says that the tabloids are the best reporting on the planet.  The Examiner just proved him right! :)

UPDATE: Allan Favish's FOIA yields more photos.
Allan Favish's Freedom Of Information Act lawsuit achieved a breakthrough
recently when a Federal District Judge ordered 5 of the 10 crime scene Polaroid photographs released. One of these is no doubt the photo of the
dark blued steel revolver and Foster's hand previously leaked by the White
House to Reuter's News Service. But the other four are photos not publicly
seen before.
Here is the judge's order.

THE EVENTS SURROUNDING THE DEATH OF VINCENT FOSTER
On July 20, 1993, six months to the day after Bill Clinton took office
as President of the United States, the White House Deputy Council, Vincent
Foster, told his secretary Deborah Gorham, "I'll be right back". He then
walked out of his office, after offering his co-worker Linda
Tripp, the leftover M&Ms from his lunch tray.
That was the last time Vincent Foster was seen alive.
Contrary to the White House spin, Vincent Foster's connection to
the Clinton's was primarily via Hillary, rather than Bill. Vincent and
Hillary had been partners together at the rose law firm, and allegations
of an ongoing affair had persisted from the
Little Rock days to the White House itself.
Vincent Foster had been struggling with the Presidential Blind trust.
Normally a trivial matter, the trust had been delayed for almost 6 months
and the U.S. trustee's office was beginning to make noises about it. Foster
was also the keeper of the files of the Clinton's Arkansas dealings and
had indicated in a written memo that "Whitewater
is a can of worms that you should NOT open!"
But Vincent's position at the White House did not sit well with him.
Only days before, following a public speech stressing the value of personal
integrity, he had confided in friends and family that he was thinking of
resigning his position. Foster had even written an outline for his letter
of resignation, thought by this writer to have been used as the center
portion of the fake "suicide note". Foster had scheduled a private meeting
with Bill Clinton for the very next day, July 21, 1993 at which it appeared
Foster intended to resign.
Vincent Foster had spent the morning making "busy work" in his office
and had been in attendance at the White House announcement of Louis Freeh
as the new head of the FBI earlier in the day (passing by the checkpoint
manned by White House uniformed guard Styles).
This is a key point. The White House is the most secure private residence
in the world, equipped with a sophisticated entry control system and video
surveillance system installed by the Mitre Corporation. Yet no record exists
that Vincent Foster left the White House under his own power on July 20th,
1993. No video of him exiting the building exists. No logbook entry shows
he checked out of the White House.
Several hours after he was last seen inside the White House, Vincent
Foster was found dead in Fort Marcy Park,
in a Virginia suburb just outside Washington D.C.
The death was ruled a suicide (the first major Washington suicide
since Secretary of Defense James Forrestal in 1949), but almost immediately
rumors began to circulate that the story of a suicide was just a cover-up
for something much worse.
The first witness to find the body insisted that there had been no
gun near the body. The memory in Foster's pager had been erased. Critical
evidence began to vanish. Many witnesses
were harassed. Others were simply ignored. There
were even suggestions that the body had been moved,
and a Secret Service memo surfaced which reported
that Foster's body had been found in his car! The official reports were
self-contradictory.

The Looting of Foster's office
While the U.S. Park Police (a unit not equipped for a proper homicide
investigation) studied the body, Foster's office at the White House was
being looted. Secret Service agent Henry O' Neill watched as Hillary Clinton's
chief of staff, Margaret Williams, carried boxes of papers out of Vincent
Foster's office before the Park Police showed up to seal it. Amazing when
you consider that the official identification of Vincent Foster's body
by Craig Livingstone did not take place
until 10PM! Speaking of Craig Livingstone, another Secret Serviceman saw
him remove items from Vincent Foster's office in violation of the official
seal. Witnesses also saw Bernard Nussbaum in Foster's office as well. Three
witnesses noted that Patsy Thomason, director of the White House's Office
of Administration, was desperate to find the combination to Vincent Foster's
safe. Ms. Thomason finally opened the safe, apparently with the help of
a special "MIG" technical team signed into the White House in the late
hours. Two envelopes reported to be in the safe by Foster's secretary Deborah
Gorham, addressed to Janet Reno and to William Kennedy III, were never
seen again. When asked the next day regarding rumors of the safe opening,
Mack McLarty told reporters Foster's office did not even have a safe, a
claim immediately shot down by former occupants of that office.
The next day, when the Park Police arrived for the official search
of Vincent Foster's office, they were shocked to learn that Nussbaum, Thomason
and Williams had entered the office. Conflicts channeled through Janet
Reno's Department of Justice resulted in the Park Police merely sitting
outside Foster's office while Bernard Nussbaum continued his own search
of Foster's office. During this search, he opened and upended Vincent Foster's
briefcase, showing it to be empty. Three days later, it would be claimed
that this same briefcase was where the torn up suicide note was discovered.
The boxes of documents removed from Foster's office by Hillary Clinton's
chief of staff, Margaret Williams, were taken to the private residence area
of the White House! Eventually, only 54 pages emerged.
One set of billing records, under subpoena for two years, and thought
to have originated in Foster's office, turned up unexpectedly in the private
quarters of the White House, with Hillary's fingerprints
on them!
So, who ordered the office looting?
Bill Clinton was unavailable, being on camera with Larry King. But
Hillary Clinton, who had only the day before diverted her planned return
to Washington D.C. to Little Rock, was on the phone from Little Rock to
someone at the White House in the moments before the looting took place.

The initial reactions
Back in Little Rock, Foster's friends weren't buying it. Doug Buford,
friend and attorney, stated, "...something was badly askew." Foster's brother-in-law,
a former congressman, also did not accept that depression was what had
been behind the "suicide": "That's a bunch of crap." And Webster Hubbell,
former Clinton deputy attorney general, phoned a mutual friend to say,
"Don't believe a word you hear. It was not suicide. It couldn't have been."
Outside experts not connected the official investigation also had
their doubts.
Vincent J. Scalise, a former NYC detective, Fred Santucci, a former
forensic photographer for NYC, and Richard Saferstein, former head of the
New Jersey State Crime Lab formed a team and did an investigation of the
VWF case for the Western Journalism Center of Fair Oaks, Calif. They arrived
at several conclusions:
(1) Homicide cannot and should not be ruled out.
(2) The position of the arms and legs of the corpse were drastically
inconsistent with suicide.
(3) Neither of VWF's hand was on the handgrip when it was fired.
This is also inconsistent with suicide. The investigators noted that in
their 50 years of combined experience they had "never seen a weapon or
gun positioned in a suicide's hand in such an orderly fashion."
(4) VWF's body was probably in contact with one or more carpets prior
to his death. The team was amazed that the carpet in the trunk of VF's
care had not been studied to see whether he had been carried to the park
in the trunk of his own car.
(5) The force of the gun's discharge probably knocked VF's glasses
flying; however, it is "inconceivable" that they could have traveled 13
feet through foliage to the site where they were found; ergo, the scene
probably was tampered with.
(6) The lack of blood and brain tissue at the site suggests VF was
carried to the scene. The peculiar tracking pattern of the blood on his
right cheek also suggests that he was moved.
Despite numerous official assurances that Vincent Foster really did
commit suicide, more and more Americans, over 70%
at the last count, no longer believe the official story. TV specials, most
notably the one put out by A&E's "Inside Investigations" with Bill
Kurtis, have failed to answer the lingering questions, indeed have engaged
in deliberate fraud to try to dismiss the evidence that points to a cover-up.

This website
This web site is built primarily from official records, newspaper reports,
and other hard data. Careful analysis of those records reveals a pattern
of deliberate obfuscation surrounding Vincent Foster's death. This pattern
of obfuscation, this cover-up, is a matter that should concern all Americans,
not because of what it means for Vincent Foster, but because of what it
means for the rest of us.
One thing is for certain. As we approach the fifth anniversary of
this crime, it is clear from the amount of resources being brought to bear
by the government that there is something about this particular crime that
has made those in power very afraid.
With the latest Zogby Poll revealing that
the majority of Americans no longer believe the official claim of suicide,
the perpetuation of the cover-up must be to prevent an examination of the
motive, why was Vincent Foster murdered and
his body dumped in Fort Marcy Park?



 NEW! Photo of Vince Foster's shirt after he was removed from Fort Marcy Park proves Foster had to have been shot where he was found.
 One of the many false trails put out by government disinformation operatives was the claim that Vince Foster really did kill himself
but did so someplace embarrassing and his body was moved to Fort Marcy Park post-mortem, explaining away the many
inconsistencies in the evidence of a suicide at Fort Marcy Park itself. Contradicting that claim was the observation that, while the body was rather bloodless
as found (suggesting that Foster was already dead by other means when a gun was fired into his mouth to simulate a suicide) once paramedics moved the body,
blood poured from the wounds, staining Foster's shirt.


 The above photo is of Vince Foster's shirt after it had been removed from his body at the Morgue. As can clearly be seen, 
the process of moving the body resulted in a great deal of blood flow from the head wounds. This proves that the gunshot wound to the head,
although most likely post-mortem, was inflicted exactly where the body was found at Fort Marcy Park.




The ABC TV Photograph.

Where's the blood?
On Friday, March 11, 1994, in response to rumors which were even then
beginning to circulate regarding Foster's death, ABC News broadcast the
following photograph, which had been leaked by the White House to Reuter's
news agency. The intent was to reinforce the claim that Foster's death
had indeed been a suicide.
The photo did not have the intended effect.
Click

I was not a political activist at the time, nor did I ever intend to become
one. My career is in feature film and TV visual effects, which I have been doing
for almost forty years. I know about film fakery. And the instant I saw
the above photo on TV I turned to my wife and said to her half jokingly,
"This is staged! If I did work this sloppy I wouldn't be working." But
the more I thought about it, the less funny it all seemed.
There are several troubling aspects in this photograph, which reveal
it to be a staged shot. First and foremost among them the total lack of
blood anywhere in the scene.
This lack of blood is the single, strongest proof that Vincent Foster
did NOT put the gun into his own mouth and pulls the trigger. Had he done
so, the blowback from the gunshot would have coated the gun, hand, and
white sleeve of Foster's shirt with a spray of blood and organic matter.
None appears in the photo anywhere.
The FBI lab report reveals that even with the most sensitive chemical
test available, no blood was found on the gun that Foster (we are told)
inserted into his mouth and fired. Not only that, Foster's fingerprints
were not on the gun.
This is the crux of the suicide theory put forward by the government,
that Vincent Foster, under stress, on a hot July day, put the barrel of
a .38 revolver into his mouth and pulled the trigger, and did not leave
blood OR FINGERPRINTS on that gun.

The lack of blood.

Was Foster already dead when the headshot was fired?
One of the key pieces of information that argued against suicide was
the lack of blood at the scene.
When the brain is destroyed, the heart will continue to beat on its
own, for as long as it has oxygenated blood to feed it. This is why head
trauma victims provide most donor hearts. The heart remains alive as long
as blood is still in the body.
In the case of a gunshot into the mouth, the bullet has to pass through
the sinus cavities. Any child who has been in a schoolyard fight knows
how easy it is for the nose to start bleeding and how hard it can be to
stop.
Had Foster really shot himself in the mouth, his heart would have
continued to beat, pumping most of his blood out through the shattered
sinus cavities and the entrance wound in his mouth, as well as out through
the supposed exit wound.
But this did not happen. Witnesses at the scene reported a "trickle"
of blood from the mouth and nose (one of the tracks appeared to have flowed
up hill).

ACTUAL VIDEO OF A SUICIDE BY SHOOTING
IN THE MOUTH. (Warning: extremely graphic depiction, not for kids)
As can be seen by the above video, after a gunshot through the head,
the heart continues to pump blood out the mouth and nose.
The front of Foster's clothing should have been soaked with blood
as the heart continued to beat. This did not happen. This indicates that
Foster's heart was already stopped when the gunshot into the mouth was
fired to mask the real cause of death.

The Fiske Report.
Robert Fiske was the first Independent Council
appointed to investigate the Whitewater scandal. For a variety of reasons,
including his past association with BCCI (a failed
bank involved with the laundering of drug money), Fiske was considered
by many unsuitable to investigate the various failed S&L in the Whitewater
affair (many of which also appear to have been involved with the laundering
of drug money) and Fiske was eventually replaced by Kenneth Starr.
The Preliminary Report On Vincent Foster
by Robert Fiske.
Note that Fiske's report was only preliminary. His final report on
Vincent Foster remains sealed. When the Wall Street Journal filed a Freedom
Of Information Act request to force the release of Fiske's final report,
the court, in an unprecedented prior restraint,
ordered the Wall Street Journal not to report on the case, or to even mention
what the final ruling actually was.
This illegal prior restraint is one of the
indicators, which reveals how terrified the government is of the facts
behind the death of Vincent Foster.



THE COVER-UP UNRAVELS
No sooner had the preliminary Fiske report been issued than it met with
immediate criticism, even from the U.S. House
of Representatives.
Careful analysis of the report by private citizens, typified by Hugh
Sprunt's "Citizen's Investigative Report" revealed dozens and dozens
of obvious and clumsy contradictions.
Yet another outstanding series of articles was written by Dave Martin
called, "America's Dreyfus Affair".

THE SILVER BLACK GUN
Among the most damning pieces of evidence to emerge from the official
records was the deliberate and fraudulent manufacturing of the testimony
of Lisa Foster in regards to the gun found with Vincent Foster's body.
Vincent Foster was found with a .38 revolver made by Colt Arms. It
was built from parts taken from two other guns, and as a result had two
serial numbers. The Frame number was 355055, and according to the records
of the Colt Arms Company , the gun was manufactured with a standard
dark blue, almost black, finish.
In the Park Police record, the
gun is described as black. The accompanying photographs
in the Park police report show a black gun.
The photograph leaked by the White House
to ABC-TV also shows a dark gun. Compare the reflectivity of the gun to
Foster's gold ring on his finger, just an inch away.
In all the statements by the Fort Marcy Park witnesses, in the Park
Police reports, in the reports by experts at the FBI and ballistics lab,
the gun is never described as anything but dark blue or (more often) black.
The photographs recently obtained in Allan
Favish's FOIA lawsuit clearly show a dark surface to the gun.
No connection exists between that gun and Vincent Foster. Foster's
fingerprints
were not on the gun. Neither was any of his blood
. The DNA traces on the gun, while "not
inconsistent" with Foster, were more likely to have originated with a black
or a Hispanic than with a Caucasian. No gunpowder
or bullet fragments were found in Foster's
wounds that could be matched to the gun!
Despite this, Robert Fiske inserted a comment on page
38 of his report on Foster; a statement that Lisa Foster thought the
gun found with her husband was one she had brought up from Little Rock,
Arkansas.
This statement came from an interview of
Lisa Foster conducted by the FBI on May 9th, 1994, more
than nine months after Vincent Foster's death.
In the handwritten notes and final FD-302a
report of the interview, the interviewing FBI agents describe the gun being
shown to Lisa Foster as "silver colored", not just once, but many times.
The gun is never described as dark blue or black.
The FBI agents are not quoting Lisa Foster, they write down THEIR
impressions of what is being said and done. In their own words, on the
bottom of page 16 and the top of page
17 of the FD-302a form, "LISA FOSTER believes that the gun found at
Fort Marcy Park may be the silver gun which she brought up with her other
belongings when she permanently moved to Washington."
In order for Lisa Foster to believe that the gun presented to her
as the Fort Marcy Park gun might be the family silver gun, the gun presented
as the Fort Marcy Park gun must also be silver. Lisa Foster doesn't have
to be a gun expert to know that silver is not black.
From the official record, its clear that Lisa Foster was shown a
gun she recognized as the gun she brought up from Little Rock, but its
equally clear that this is not the same gun as that found with Vincent
Foster. Black is not silver.
CLICK HERE TO REVIEW THE OFFICIAL RECORDS
THAT PROVE THE FBI MANUFACTURED LISA FOSTER'S TESTIMONY.
Gun powder residue was found on Foster's body, although not in his mouth. Later testing showed the residue to be unique to Winchester .22 ammunition, as reported in the amended complaint filed by attorney John Clarke on behalf of Patrick KNowlton.

Patrick Knowlton
The credibility of the suicide claim took another hit when one of the
witnesses at Fort Marcy Park, Patrick Knowlton, came forward to claim that
the FBI had altered his testimony. Patrick was then harassed and threatened,
which prompted the filing of a lawsuit
for witness tampering.

Perry/Patterson
The White House had come forward to claim that they were not notified
of the discovery of Vincent Foster's body until quite late in the evening.
This was a critical item relating to when Vincent Foster's office was officially
sealed for the investigation and (as it later came out) when it was being
looted of records.
But two Arkansas State Troopers put the White House's official time
of notification in doubt.
Roger Perry and Larry Patterson had both come forward to report a
phone call made from the White House to the Arkansas Governor's mansion
approximately two hours earlier than the White House claimed it had learned
of Foster's death. The Clinton's nanny, Helen Dicky, made the call.
During the Whitewater hearings, Helen placed the call much later,
and to bring the issue to an end the committee members announced to all
that the "former" troopers had changed their minds and would not testify
to receiving the call any earlier than Helen stated.
This, of course, was yet another lie. Perry and Patterson were not
"former" anything; they were still Arkansas State troopers who had wanted
to testify but were kept out.
Angered and with no other venue, Perry and Patterson swore out affidavits
stating the facts as they knew them.

Linda Tripp
Recently, at the end of her appearance before the Monica Lewinsky Grand
Jury, Linda Tripp issued a public statement
that hinted at the deceptions behind the death of Vincent Foster.



THE "SUICIDE" NOTE

AT LEAST PARTLY A FORGERY.
No single item connected to the Foster death has aroused as much controversy
as the so-called "suicide" note.
This was a note, allegedly written by Vincent Foster and discovered
in his briefcase some days after his death. The problem was that Bernard
Nussbaum, in controlling the Park Police search of Foster's office, had
shown them that same briefcase empty just two days before. Coupled with
that was the fact that the White House did not report the existence of
the note for almost 36 hours after it was allegedly discovered.
Adding another odd aspect to the note was the great pains taken to
conceal it from the public. Even though the text itself had been published,
Jim Hamilton made a point, during Lisa Foster's FBI interview to remind
everyone that photos of the note were
not to be allowed out, even in response to a Freedom of Information Act
Request.
Hamilton went to far as to request, in a letter (page
1 - page 2) to Janet Reno, the
return of the actual "suicide" note as soon as possible, and thanks her
again for refusing to allow photographs of the note to be allowed in public.
Such secrecy surrounding a supposed suicide note aroused much curiosity,
which was finally satisfied when someone on the inside leaked a photocopy
of the note to the Wall Street Journal, which published it.
The availability of the note prompted James Davidson at Strategic
Investment to commission three of the world's top document examiners to
examine the note.
In their report, all three experts judged
the note to be a forgery!
This hardly came as a surprise. An even cursory
examination reveals that at last two different hands worked on that note,
suggesting that Foster's outline for a letter of resignation (for that
is what Lisa Foster thought the note had been) was modified. A botched
attempt at a signature may have required the strange tearing of the note
with the loss of one-piece right where the signature would go.
The note had fingerprints on it. Officially, the origin of the prints
remains undetermined, but while testifying before the Whitewater committee,
the FBI expert reported that one palm print was identified as belonging
to Bernard Nussbaum.



THE AUTOPSY

FOSTER'S "MAGIC" BULLET HOLE.
Virtually the entire case for supposed suicide rests firmly on the autopsy
done by Dr. James C. Beyer, a pathologist for Fairfax County, Virginia
with strong ties to the FBI.
Dr. Bayer's autopsy report at
first reading seems unremarkable. It's conclusion is that Vincent Foster
died of a single gunshot wound entering the roof of the mouth and exiting
the back of the skull.
But on closer examination, problems become apparent.
Dr. Beyer's co-worker at the Fairfax County, Virginia, medical examiner's
office is Dr. Donald Haut. It was Dr. Haut, not Dr. Beyer, who actually
examined Vincent Foster's body while it was still at Fort Marcy Park, assisted
by John Rolla. On page two of Dr. Haut's signed
report, the wound track is described as a "gunshot wound mouth to neck".
This corroborates the eyewitness testimony of EMS Technician Richard
Arthur, who described the gunshot wound in some detail, placing it under
the right ear. This is consistent with the news
story reported by Ambrose Evens-Pritchard, who described
a photograph of that wound.
Was there really an exit wound out the back of Foster's head?
Prior to the body's delivery to Beyer, nobody reported a gunshot
wound out the back of the head. EMS Sergeant Gonzalas stated he did NOT
see a gunshot wound out the back of the head. John Rolla did not report
a gunshot wound out the back of the head. Another EMS Technician, Cory
Ashford, testified is a tape recorded interview with reporter Chris
Ruddy that he was certain there was NO exit wound at the back of the
head while Vincent Foster was at Fort Marcy Park!
Outside of the obviously altered page one
of Dr. Haut's report, there isn't a single official record of a gunshot
wound exiting the back of Foster's head while he's still at Fort Marcy
Park.
It is not until the body arrives at Dr. Beyer's morgue that the neck
wound seen by Arthur and Haut seems to go away and the wound out the back
of the head appears.
On the wound description page in the
Beyer autopsy, the box for neck wounds has been left blank.
But the wound that Beyer DOES describe is rather odd. Supposedly,
the wound is the result of a soft nosed unjacketed lead bullet being fired
through two dense bones, first at the base of the skull and then at the
rear. There should be metal fragments all over the wound track. For a comparison,
take a look at the X-ray taken of John F. Kennedy's
skull following his assassination. Metal fragments are seen throughout
the interior of the skull, and this is from a full metal jacket round,
the type that LIMITS fragmentation!
Yet in describing the wound track in Vincent Foster's head, Beyer
notes on page 2 of his report that no metallic
fragments were recovered during the examination! There should have been
lead scrapings all over the bone perforations, had a soft-nosed lead bullet
really made them!
More recently, a FBI telex was uncovered
which reported that the autopsy conducted by the Fairfax County Medical
Examiner had found a bullet entry but NO EXIT WOUND!
The missing X-rays
Beyer himself checked and signed the boxes
on his report indicating that X-rays had been taken. Dr. Beyer told
Park Police Detective James G. Morrissette that the X-rays showed no bullet
fragments at all. Again, with the type of ammunition in the gun found with
Foster's body, this is impossible.
Of course, the X-rays were not to be found. Beyer later claimed that
they hadn't been taken, and that his X-ray machine was broken, although
the service records on that machine do not bear out this claim.
The missing crime scene photos
With the exception of a few Polaroid photos that are currently the
subject of Allan
Favish's FOIA lawsuit, no photographs
of the crime scene exist.
The 35mm photographs taken by the Park Police were supposedly underexposed
in the laboratory (although Starr investigator Miquel
Rodriguez reportedly used an outside lab to successfully recover images
from the film, just prior to his conflict with Mark Touhey and subsequent
resignation from the OIC).
In addition to the 35mm photos, many more of the Polaroids of the
crime scene simply vanished.
It turns out that Beyer was the last person known to be in possession
of the now-vanished crime scene Polaroids. Rolla was unable to attend the
autopsy of Vincent Foster because the autopsy was moved up 24 hours unexpectedly.
As Rolla stated in his testimony, "Normally you like to have at least one
of the scene investigators at the autopsy to answer questions for the medical
examiner [Dr. James C. Beyer], but he had the photographs and copies of
the reports."
Rolla testified that the photos were inside the case jacket when
the jacket went to Beyer. After it had come back, the photos were gone.
Note also that whereas it is normal to have investigators present for the
autopsy, the last minute schedule change, moving the Foster up a day, meant
that Beyer performed a significant part of the autopsy unobserved. By the
time Park Police observers saw the body, Beyer had removed Foster's entire
tongue and upper palette, obliterating the "mouth to neck" gunshot wound
Dr. Haut had seen.
Clearly, something is very wrong with the autopsy and the preponderance
of evidence points to Beyer as author of the deception. Certainly, he was
well positioned to tamper with Dr. Haut's original
report, altering the page 1 description.
Beyer's past history isn't the most reassuring. Indeed he seems to
be the Virginia version of the infamous Dr. Fahmy Malek, the Arkansas M.E.
who ignored clear evidence of homicide in the deaths of Don Henry and Kevin
Ives and in one case ruled that a man who had been beheaded was dead of
natural causes.
Beyer himself, in the case of Tommy Burkett,
ignored a broken jaw in order to rule that Burkett had killed himself with
a gun. Despite having shown the autopsy photos to Burkett's father, Beyer
later claimed (as he did with the Foster X-rays) that they had never
really existed. After a second autopsy, the case was reopened as a
homicide.
Likewise, in 1989 there was an autopsy on establishing the death
of a man named Tim Easley. Mr. Beyer, the coroner,
ruled that Easley killed himself by stabbing himself in the chest. He failed
to notice a defensive wound on the man's hand. The case was reopened, and,
after an outside expert reviewed the case, Easley's girlfriend confessed
to murdering him.
In short, Dr. Beyer's consistent performance (indeed his "specialty")
appears to be the cover-up of murder by declaration of suicide!
In the case of Vincent Foster, the question must be asked if Dr.
Beyer, given his past history, changed a non-fatal neck wound seen by witnesses
at Fort Marcy Park into a fatal head shot needed for the suicide cover
up.




THE FOSTER AUTOPSY AND PROOF THAT X-RAYS
WERE TAKEN.



DOCUMENTED PROOF OF A WOUND ON FOSTER'S NECK
CONCEALED BY THE OFFICIAL AUTOPSY, AND THE FBI MEMO THAT CONFIRMS THERE
WAS NO EXIT WOUND TO THE BACK OF FOSTER'S HEAD!
 
 
 





The Starr Report.
Long before the actual release of Kenneth
Starr's report on Vincent Foster, and despite an appearance of a
sincere effort at investigation, there were indications of an impending
continuance of the cover-up started by Starr's predecessor, Robert Fiske
(the BCCI lawyer).
The first indication came with Starr's handling of investigator Miquel
Rodriquez' conflicts with fellow investigator Mark Touhey. Rodriquez
had uncovered what he thought was clear evidence of a cover-up in the death
of Vincent Foster; in hindsight it would be almost impossible not to.
By way of example, Rodriguez had taken the 35mm negatives taken at
the Fort Marcy Park location, which had been declared unusable, and taken
them to an outside image enhancement lab which succeeded in recovering
images from the negatives.
Under normal circumstances, one would assume such a success at recovering
data would meet with approval, but such was not to be. Rodriguez came under
severe criticism and opposition from fellow investigator Mark Touhey. When
Rodriguez took the conflict to Kenneth Starr, Starr backed Touhey and Rodriguez
was forced to resign, his enhanced photographs of the crime scene have
never been released.
Further confirmation of Starr's intentions came when the FBI records
regarding the showing of a silver gun to Lisa Foster first surfaced. Hugh
Sprunt, in one of his many meetings with investigators from Kenneth
Starr's office, informed them of this discovery. Starr's investigators,
echoing the claims being put out on the internet at the time, assured Hugh
Sprunt that the photo leaked by the White House to Reuter's was quite misleading
with regard to the gun's color, and that it was reasonable to consider
the gun to be of "silver color". As can be seen by the high quality photographs
of the gun released as part of Allan Favish's Freedom Of Information Act
lawsuit, the gun is quite dark, and not to be confused with a shiny silver
gun.
With such an obvious pander to the official story coming from the
lips of Starr's own investigators, it therefore came as no surprise that
Kenneth
Starr's report on Vincent Foster continued the claim of suicide. But
unlike the Fiske Report, Starr's Report had something new. It had an addendum.
This addendum had been submitted
by the attorney for Patrick Knowlton,
John Clarke, and had been added to Starr's Report by the three-judge panel
supervising his work over Starr's strenuous objections!
The addendum so undermined the conclusions
of Starr's report that Starr had it published in a second, separate volume
from his own report. Copies of the Starr report were then distributed to
the media without the second volume. Most Americans to this day are not
aware of the existence of the court ordered addendum to the Starr Report.
Kenneth Starr caught in a lie.
In his report on Vincent Foster, Kenneth Starr attempted to resolve
some of the lingering questions regarding the claim of suicide.
One such question involved the dark blued steel gun found with Foster's
body (the gun that the FBI had fraudulently tried to link to Vincent Foster)
which did not have any of his fingerprints on it.
Kenneth Starr included in his report the comment that glove box of
Vincent Foster's car contained an oven mitt. Dr. Henry Lee had concluded
that Vincent Foster had carried the dark blued steel revolver to Fort Marcy
Park inside the oven mitt and that this explained the lack of fingerprints.
Of course, there is a huge logic flaw in the claim. Star reports
that the oven mitt was left in the car, photographed inside the glove box
by the Park Police the very next day. Foster would therefore have to have
carried the dark blued steel revolver with him from the car, without
the protection of the oven mitt, then placed it inside his mouth and pulled
the trigger.
The presence of the oven mitt in the glove box therefore does not
explain the lack of fingerprints on the dark blued steel revolver found
next to Foster's body.
While there may be legitimate reasons for an oven mitt to be in the
glove box there is some question as to whether the oven mitt was really
in Foster's car as represented by Kenneth Starr.
Starr states that the oven mitt was photographed by the Park Police
in their impound lot the day after Foster's body was found, July 21st,
1993. And, in the photographs from Allan Favish's
FOIA lawsuit, there are photographs
showing an oven mitt quite prominently on display inside the glove box.
But there is a problem. A photograph
taken at Fort Marcy Park the night of July 20th 1993 clearly shows
debris on the passenger side floor.
In the Park Police records, Detective Braun emptied the glove box
of all items PRIOR to detective Smith removing and cataloguing the
debris from the passenger seat floor. Records show Braun emptying the glove
box prior to leaving the Park Police impound lot as 6:35 AM July 21st.
Detective Smith's paperwork has him cleaning off the passenger side floor
after noon on July 21st.
Clearly, a photograph showing the glove box with items in it over
a clean passenger side floor is in direct contradiction to the Park Police
record of the search of Foster's car.
The photographs of the oven mitt appear
to be after-the-fact stagings at best, complete frauds at worst. When Detective
Braun emptied the glove box from Vincent Foster's car, her inventory did
not record the presence of an oven mitt.



Lisa Foster
It's easy to simply dismiss Lisa Foster as the hapless victim of a tragedy,
and to (as so many supporters of the suicide theory have argued) declare
her off-limits in any analysis of the events surrounding the death of her
first husband.
However, there are indications that Lisa Foster has had her own suspicions
regarding just how her husband died.
When John Rolla first arrived at the Foster's D.C. home to inform
Lisa Foster of the discovery of her husband's body at Fort Marcy Park,
Rolla noted an unusual event in his report.
What Rolla saw fit to comment on was the strange reaction of Lisa
Foster to Rolla's describing the gun found with her husband's body, in
which at the mention of the gun's color Lisa simply exits the room in a
highly emotional state.
In Lisa Foster's FBI interview it was
established that the only gun that was in the Foster's Washington D.C.
Residence was a chrome plated revolver. It is apparent that Lisa would
have had to know that the black gun being described to her by Rolla was
not
her husband's.
But rather than say anything about the discrepancy, Lisa Foster simply
terminated the discussion.
Yet another indication of acquiescence if not complicity was found
in Lisa Foster's New Yorker
interview, basically a spin piece in which Lisa Foster talked about
the stresses of the preceding two years but said nothing to challenge the
suicide theory of her husband's death.
Now, at the time Lisa Foster did this interview, she had to know
deception existed in the case. John Rolla had told her that the gun found
with her husband's body was black. Lisa knew that the black gun could not
be the Foster family's silver gun. When shown a photograph of the dark
blued steel gun she did not identify it. But by the time this interview
took place, she had been through the FBI interview in which a silver gun
was presented to her as the gun found with her husband's body! Lisa Foster
did not comment on the magically changed gun during the interview, nor
did she take the opportunity to mention the issue during her interview
with the New Yorker.
It's important not to ascribe a sinister motive to Lisa Foster's
actions. A mother who has seen her children lose one parent and is reasonably
concerned that they not lose another easily explains them.
Shortly after the New Yorker interview, Lisa Foster married Judge
Moody in Arkansas. Shortly after that, Moody's son Neil was killed in a
high-speed traffic accident. Witnesses reported he was being pursued at
the time of the crash.



The Endless Spin
No sooner had questions surfaced regarding the circumstances of Vincent
Foster's death than a crowd of people surged forth to assure America that
Vincent Foster had indeed been depressed even though he had clearly concealed
it from everyone around him.
Leading the attack was CBS "60 Minutes", which had openly
admitted biasing its handling of the Gennifer Flower's segment in 1992
to help Bill Clinton win the nomination. Quit a far cry from the media
handling of Gary Hart's infidelities!
So, when reporter Chris Ruddy
started writing a series of article for the New York Post regarding the
inconsistencies in the Vincent Foster case, "60 Minutes" again stepped
again to Bill Clinton's defense with a hit piece on Ruddy. The mis-reporting
was so outrageous and error filled that Accuracy
in Media and issued some highly critical
reports, as did Congressman Dan Burton.
Next came a segment of the A&E program "Inside Investigations"
with Bill Kurtis, which attempted to explain the absence of fingerprints
on the gun found with Foster's body by showing how the deep grooves of
a modern automatic pistol simply do not provide the surfaces needed to
capture fingerprints. That Foster's body was not found with a modern automatic
pistol with deep grooves and heavy texturing, but with a smooth
metal revolver, was not mentioned.
The extreme lengths that Mike Wallace went to attack those who doubted
the official suicide story resulted in the following cartoon.
Chris Ruddy's cartoon.

Writing books in support of the official lie has become a growth
industry with "Blood Sport" and "Washington Tragedy" being prime examples.
In the book Blood Sport (page 284), Susan Thomases describes a meeting
in her room at a private boarding house in which Vincent Foster "unburdened
himself" to her. Our spies have succeeded in locating and photographing
the room, just so that you get an idea of what life in service to the White
House is like.

"Blood Sport", hailed as the true telling of the Foster suicide,
was so filled with errors that author James Stewert, a Columbia University
Professor, described the gun found with Vincent Foster' body as "silver
colored" (obviously having read the FBI files from the Lisa
Foster interview).

The above two pages are from a transcript of the Diane Rehm Show
on WAMU FM 88.5 in Washington D.C. The in-studio guest is James Stewert.
A caller, "Larry", points out to James Stewert the fact that the gun found
with Foster is actually black. Stewert tries to equivocate, then simply
yanks the plug on Larry.
This transcript makes clear that Stewert KNOWS he is in error on
the gun color, and is refusing to acknowledge its implications.
Ergo, Stewert and his book are purely propaganda!

The public reaction
With the mainstream media having abandoned its self-proclaimed role
of watchdog against government abuse, the public at large began to seek
other, less traditional venues to display their awareness.
An unknown party traced out the words "Foster murder" at the base
of the Washington Monument, using garden fertilizer! This prompted the
following news story.

THE WASHINGTON MONUMENT "EVENT".
NY POST - April 18, 1996
"PARANOID POSSE GUS FOR BROWN"
By Richard Johnson
(last paragraph)
"Finally, lest Foster be forgotten, our spy peering out a window
atop the Washington Monument claims that the letters 'FOSTER' are eerily
spelled out in the lawn looking toward the Lincoln Memorial. Presumably,
a prankster armed with a bag of fertilizer wanted all those unmindful tourists
to wonder, 'whose next?'"


Hardly had the National Park service removed the lettering and as
the aroma wafted unnoticed across the Capitol Building, the photographs
of the fertilizer words appeared as an underground postcard.
Distributed from one Internet activist to the next, the networks
and even the White House itself were flooded with these postcards mailed
from across the nation.

and the text above it is scanned from the actual part of the FBI's FD-302a
which proves that Lisa Foster was shown a silver gun by the FBI. Talk about
if looks could kill! The graphic is reproduced here and permission is granted
to make up your own T-shirts with it. Have fun. Piss off a mainstream media

Vincent D Foster












Mr Vincent D Foster, CPA 

Overview Vincent D. Foster has served as the Chairman of our Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer and as a member of our investment committee since 2007. Mr. Foster also currently serves as a founding director of Quanta Services, Inc. (NYSE: PWR), which provides specialty contracting services to the power, natural gas and telecommunications industries; Team, Inc. (NASDAQ: TISI), which provides specialty contracting services to the petrochemical, refining, electric power and other heavy industries; and Carriage Services, Inc. (NYSE: CSV), a death-care company. He also served as a director of U.S. Concrete, Inc. (NASDAQ-CM: USCR) from 1999 until 2010. In addition, Mr. Foster serves as a founding director of the Texas TriCities Chapter of the National Association of Corporate Directors.
He had a 19-year career with Arthur Andersen, where he was a partner from 1988-1997. Mr. Foster was the director of Andersen's Corporate Finance and Mergers and Acquisitions practice for the Southwest United States and specialized in working with companies involved in consolidating their respective industries. From 1997, Mr. Foster co-founded and has acted as co-managing partner or chief executive of several Main Street predecessor funds and entities, which are now subsidiaries of ours.
Graduated from Michigan State University, a C.P.A.
Mr. Foster received his J.D. from Wayne State University Law School and also attended the University of Houston Law Center.
Mr. Foster received the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2008 Award in the financial services category in the Houston & Gulf Coast Area. The program honors entrepreneurs who have demonstrated exceptionality in innovation, financial performance and personal commitment to their businesses and communities. We believe Mr. Foster is qualified to serve on our Board of Directors because of his intimate knowledge of our operations through his day-to-day leadership as Chief Executive Officer of Main Street, along with his comprehensive experience on other public Boards of Directors and his extensive experience in tax, accounting, mergers and acquisitions, corporate governance and finance.

Vince Foster committed suicide July 20, 1993.  In the spring and early
summer of that year 'Travelgate' erupted. It was one of a series of  problems
and 'scandals' Foster was confronting - not only in his role as deputy White
House counsel but - as in the case of Whitewater -  in his role as personal
lawyer for the Clintons.  It all took a toll on Foster, and  his wife and
friends sensed his gathering despair.  

Before clicking here for the notations  from Foster's journal, the following brief background on Travelgate is helpful in understanding the notations:

Harry Thomason, a close friend of the Clintons, and Thomason's partner Darnell
Martens, had helped the Clinton campaign by providing charter air service.
After the election, Harry was everywhere in and around the White House, working
on improving the First Couple's image.  His most disastrous meddling came when
his partner Darnell told Harry he'd heard rumors that the White House Travel
Office was corrupt, and worse, disloyal to the First Family.  (This happened in
the time frame of the leaks about marital discord in the White House and
everyone was ultra sensitive.)  So Harry began pressing Hillary, telling her
that the travel office people were "a bunch of crooks" and that "we've got to
get our people in there."

Hillary, in turn, pressed Vince Foster and David Watkins (who in her opinion
were already failing her because of leaks, the secret service, etc,).  Quickly,
the whole messy and silly 'Travelgate' episode was in full swing.

The FBI was called in.  A young cousin of Clinton's appointed herself undercover
agent in the Travel Office and started sneaking memos away in the dark of
night.  Harry Thomason kept asking Watkins what was being done.  Hillary kept
asking Vince Foster what was being done.  The FBI showed a disconcerting
willingness to help find some evidence of wrongdoing (though none of them had
any solid basis for suspicion except for those 'rumors.')

In the end, seven staffers in the Travel Office were fired.  But the staffers
had pals in the press who wrote their story and suddenly Congress is talking
about an investigation into the firing.

Suddenly, the White House (it's now May-June-July 1993) is on the defensive,
trying to explain itself.  At a press conference, George Stephanoupolos says
the FBI had evidence the travel office people were crooks - an assertion that
the FBI disputes.

And then came the inevitable self-inquiry, led by White House lawyer John
Podesta, which was aimed at pointing the finger some place besides at Hillary
and her meddling friend, Harry Thomason.  In the end, David Watkins and, to a
degree Vince Foster got the blame.  

All of this made Foster quite sick.  He was integrally involved in Travelgate,
having been consulted by Watkins because he was a White House lawyer.  He'd
overseen the 'investigation' of the seven Travel Office employees (though he'd
always been cautious about acting precipitously).  He'd participated in
meetings with the FBI. And most importantly, he'd discussed the problem with
Hillary - who had impatiently asked him "what's being done" about those
crooked, disloyal Travel Office people.

Over the course of several weeks, Foster, in his careful, lawyerly,
increasingly distressed fashion, laid out his case in a private chronology he
kept in a spiral notebook.  He'd write down his memory of events, consult his
calendar, add things here and there.  And then, he'd write it all down again,
over and over, narrowing, broadening, editing - obsessing, in other words.  He
plainly feared embarrassment and public humiliation in a Congressional hearing
that he believed was coming.  Through it all, he was clearly motivated by his
pointed intention to protect HRC - the Client.

Read the notations from his journal:


Foster's first recollection of a meeting with Hillary about the Travel Office affair
A later recollection of the same meeting
His strategy for dealing with the Travelgate scandal
Notes from a meeting with John Podesta, White House Deputy Chief of Staff, about the in-house inquiry
