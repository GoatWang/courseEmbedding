Ennis, Inc., Print Industry Leader Thrives In The Digital Era - Ennis, Inc. (NYSE:EBF) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Ennis, Inc., Print Industry Leader Thrives In The Digital EraSep.16.16 | About: Ennis, Inc. (EBF) Danielle Sherman Value, growth at reasonable price, long-term horizonSummaryEBF reached a 12-month low and is a good investment opportunity.Innovative digital products and specialty items set Ennis apart from competitors.Ennis’ consistency over the past few years indicates the strength and permanence of the company.Time to follow a good lead? Ennis, Inc., currently trading at $16.57, is at a near twelve-month low and an excellent opportunity. Ennis, Inc (NYSE:EBF) is a major supplier of wholesale print products. Founded over 100 years ago as a single print shop in Ennis, TX, in 1907, Ennis evolved to include 55 U.S. locations, 2,300 employees, and 40,000 worldwide distributors and 38 brands. Ennis is a printing powerhouse and industry leader with the slogan, "If it can be printed or printed on, Ennis has it!" The array of manufactured goods spans economic markets and diverse product lines. The Print Services & Distribution Association (PSDA) named Ennis, Inc. a Top Supplier. Forbes magazine named Ennis one of the Best 200 Small Companies for multiple years. Ennis is recognized for corporate responsibility and sustainable practices Eco-friendly practices include integrating alternative fibers and recycled materials, while applying clean press technologies in the manufacturing processes. Conscious of environmental impact, Ennis monitors waste, conservation and overall facility environment. Keith Walters has served as the Chairman, CEO, and president of Ennis since September of 1997. In the Annual Report for the fiscal year ending February 29, 2016, Walters notes that despite sliding market share to emerging technologies, Ennis has remained successful the past 19 years. The print segment had a sales increase of $5.5 million (1.4%) during past 12 month period, however much of the increase is attributed to acquisitions which enhanced product line diversity. Last year Ennis acquired Kay Toledo Tag and SSP. Kay Toledo Tag boosted the print segment, exceeding expectations, and reached the three-year earnings goal within the first year. In response to declining market demand for print materials, Ennis focuses on innovative customer solutions for print-on-demand and digital business services. Ennis is also continuing to expand products to include specialty items not offered by competitors such as healthcare wristbands, secure document solutions, in-mold labels, and high-color web printing.
 Ennis is diversified in the apparel sector, and experienced overall declining performance. Apparel sale decrease of $16.9 million (8.5%) over the past year is attributed to competitive market, unpredictable market trends, and the volatile cotton market. Ennis' market capital currently stands at $431.88M. At present the P/E ratio is 44.07, with a forward P/E ratio of 17.44 indicating potential for future sales growth. The forward annual dividend rate is $.70, with a 4.27% annual yield. The most recent dividend was distributed on August 8th, 2016. Ennis' dividend history over the past few years is indicative of the stability of the company. Ennis' consistency over the past few years is a good sign of the strength and determination of the company. Instead of allowing the declining paper product market to slow them down, Ennis has turned to new and innovative products and services to meet the ever-changing needs of consumers. Given the current stock price and future outlook, now is an ideal time to purchase shares in Ennis, Inc.
