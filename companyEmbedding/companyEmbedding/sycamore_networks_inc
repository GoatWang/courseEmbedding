Sycamore Networks Solutions, Inc. Launches as Private Company




Marlin Equity Partners Completes Acquisition and Appoints John Scully 
      as President and CEO






February 01, 2013 07:10 AM Eastern Standard Time



CHELMSFORD, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sycamore Networks Solutions, Inc. today announced its launch as a 
      privately held company following Marlin Equity Partners’ (“Marlin”) 
      acquisition of Sycamore Networks, Inc.’s bandwidth management product 
      and service business, which includes industry-leading optical networking 
      and multiservice access solutions deployed in fixed line and mobile 
      networks around the world. The new Marlin entity, which will continue to 
      use the brand name “Sycamore Networks,” will be led by John Scully as 
      president and chief executive officer. Most recently, Mr. Scully served 
      as Sycamore’s vice president of worldwide sales and support.
    


      “Sycamore’s carrier-class networking solutions form the critical 
      foundation for many of the world’s leading communications networks, and 
      we believe the company is well positioned to deliver enhanced value to 
      its global customers as it moves forward,” said Pat DiPietro, operating 
      partner at Marlin. “We are pleased to appoint John to the role of 
      president and CEO, and we are committed to providing the strategic 
      guidance and financial resources necessary to ensure the company’s 
      success as it enters a new phase of growth and innovation.”
    

      “I am extremely honored to lead a dedicated organization with a proven 
      track record of technology innovation and an unwavering commitment to 
      excellence in customer service and support,” said Mr. Scully. “We are 
      very excited about the opportunities we see ahead of us, and look 
      forward to strengthening our relationships with current and prospective 
      customers as we expand the features and capabilities of our solutions 
      portfolio.”
    

      Mr. Scully brings over 25 years of executive leadership, sales and 
      marketing experience in high-growth technology companies to his new 
      role. Prior to joining Sycamore Networks, he served as vice president of 
      worldwide sales and support at Eastern Research, Inc., where he drove 
      significant revenue growth and market share gain for the company’s 
      access networking solutions. Previously, Mr. Scully held senior 
      management positions at Test Link/Tel Link, Datatel, Cray 
      Communications, and Data Decisions. Mr. Scully holds a B.A. in 
      Communications from the University of Dayton in Dayton, Ohio.
