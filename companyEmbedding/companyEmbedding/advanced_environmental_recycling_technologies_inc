Mar 17 17
Advanced Environmental Recycling Technologies, Inc. announced earnings results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2016. The company's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, at $85.3 million were up $2.7 million or 3.2% from the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily due to increased ChoiceDek sales to Lowe's and an increase in OEM sales. Net income for 2016 was $2.2 million versus the $0.9 million net loss recorded in 2015. Prior to the end of the year, a $2.8 million charge was recognized to reduce the carrying cost of the Watts recycling facility to estimated current fair value. Plans are to increase the output of the Lowell facility and effect an overhead cost reduction and improved labor efficiency. Before this charge, the company's operating income was $8.9 million, a $4.8 million increase over the prior year. This represents an increase from 4.9% to 10.4% of net sales.

The company's fourth quarter sales were $18.7 million versus $17.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, a 9.4% increase. Strong ChoiceDek sales were the primary reason for the increase.
