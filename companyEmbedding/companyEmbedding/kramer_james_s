KRAMER'S BEST ANTIQUE IMPROVER 
             Other Kramer's 
            Bestproducts...




The Kramer's Best product you will use most often is the Kramer's Best Antique Improver. It is very versatile and will cover most of your restoration and maintenance needs.  We do, however, offer 2 other products for more specialized needs. You will not need these products as often, but when you do, they are your very best choice for the job.





Kramer's Best Blemish Clarifier, is a powerful natural cleaner. It 
              is useful and effective on wood, metal and many other materials. 
              Use it for severe  cleaning projects that go beyond 
              what the Antique Improver can do. Blemish Clarifier 
              is very effective in tackling the removal of heavy grimy surface 
              build-up and ground-in grease and oil. After becoming familiar with 
              use of the Clarifier you will know beforehand when it is 
              needed, but if you aren't sure, start with the Antique Improver. 
              If you do not see the required results, pre-cleaning with Blemish 
               Clarifier may be necessary. Use the 
              Clarifier to go deep into the wood to help flush out embedded 
              foreign materials or to help break down a thick surface buildup. 
              Multiple cleanings may be necessary on the most severe cases. The 
              Clarifier, because of its natural and compatible ingredients, 
              goes deeply into the finish and the wood, gently displacing foreign 
              materials, lifting them to the surface. Very old and severely damaged 
              pieces might take several of these sessions to complete the restoration. 
              Modern caustic cleaners may do the job quicker, but damage to the 
              finish and the wood could be tragic. The final result of working 
              slowly and surely with safe and gentle materials is worth the effort. 
              After cleaning with the Clarifier, use applications of Kramer's 
              Best Antique Improver to replace the natural oils and restore 
              the color and beauty to the piece. 





[Samples shown: The old cabinet door shown 
              above was found on the floor of a barn. Several applications of 
              Blemish Clarifier were needed to flush out years of accumulated 
              grime and dirt. Clarifier was also used on half of the wood 
              plane (right) to remove ground-in grease and dirt. The boiler lid 
              is an example of one of the product's many other uses. It does an 
              exceptional job cleaning a variety of materials. After cleaning 
              with the Clarifier, each of these pieces had wipes of Kramer's 
              Best Antique Improver. See the book of Instructions and Uses for full information.]







 
Kramer's Best Wood Food Oyl,  
        is for use on food service items, such as butcher 
        blocks, salad bowls, cutting boards, etc.  anything that 
        will be in direct contact with food.  Keeping these utensils clean 
        and safe requires regular washing with lots of hot soapy water and a scalding 
        rinse. These pieces soon dry out, lose their color and will crack 
        and split over time if left untreated.  As with other modern wood 
        care products, the formulations offered for the care of wooden food utensils 
        usually have petroleum derivatives, such as mineral oil, as their base. 
        Repeated use may leave a "gummy" build-up. Only materials natural 
        to the wood are capable of furnishing what is necessary for effective 
        care.  Food-grade oils, such as the common vegetable oils may be 
        more desirable, but may turn rancid over time.  Our Kramer's Best 
        Wood Food Oyl,  when applied occasionally as needed, reverses 
        the dryness and at the same time maintains the natural appearance and 
        condition of the piece.
Use your treenware, as it was intended, without worry. 
        If the wood seems dry, work some of the Wood Food Oyl into the wood. 
        Continue to use and care for your pieces in your normal way, reapplying 
        the Wood Food Oyl, as necessary, if you begin to see surface dryness return.
Both the Kramer's Best Blemish Clarifier and 
        Kramer's Best Wood Food Oyl are exceptional products. Not everyone 
        has a need for them, and you may not use them as often as you do the Antique 
        Improver. But keep them in mind. After you have become familiar with 
        using the Antique Improver and seen what it can do, you may find 
        ways you can also use these to great benefit.
 
Complete information and instructions 
        can be found in the 
Book of Instructions and Suggested Uses.
Remember to read and understand the instructions 
        before using and
        ALWAYS TEST FIRST!

Kramer's Best...products that do what you 
        hoped the others would do!
