The fox is an omnivore and their diet includes fruits, berries, and grasses. They have also have a particulary long tails. Their defenses include their sharp teeth.My HybridMy hybrid would be good for this habitat because there is a lot of grass and all three of my animals eat grass so the food supply is there. The reason I used the body and legs as a horse is because they can run fast and they can kick really hard. The Foxes tail would be for protection because their tails can swing fast and veryn hard. This is why I choose the animals for this Hybrid.My BiomeMy biome is the Dry Mid latitude climate Steppe. In the summer time it tends to be 104 degrees Fahrenheit, and in the winter can get down to -40 degrees Fahrenheit. There is not enough precipitation for trees to grow except by rivers. There is not a lot of vegatation but a couple of the types are Fringed Sagebrush, Milk Vetch, Sweet Vernal, Rhubarb, and Tumbleweed. Some of the animal life is Corsac Fox, Mongolian Gerbil, Saiga Antelope, Northern Lynx, and the Saker Falcon, Rabbits, mice, antelope, and horses. There are only trees near rivers because they have drought like symptons.Animal 1: AntelopeMy 2 Animal is a HorseThe antelope mostly eats difrent types of grasses. The antelopes habitat is mostly forests and grasslands. Antelopes of the smallest breed is mature enough to have babies 6 months after they are born. Then the largest of breeds of antelopes take about 3-4 years to mature to be able to reproduce. The antelope has horns to protect itself from their preadators and to also fight other antelopes in their herds. Antelopes are herbivores.  My second animal is a horse. Horses originally came from steepe areas of Eastern Europe and Northern Asia. The diet of a horse they are herbivores, they mostly eat juicy grasses. Their predators are Bears, Moutain Lions, and also wolves have been known to attack horses. The horses averge life span is 20-25 years. The first instinct of danger around a horse their first move is to run, bu twhen not possible they begin to kick their powerful legs.Full transcriptMore presentations by

Michael Joseph is a photographer best known for his work on the Rolling Stones’ classic album “Beggar’s Banquet.” A fine art quality embodies Michael Joseph’s collection of Beggars Banquet photographs, as illustrated by the bright victorian-inspired styling of their group shots. The session took place at Sarum Chase, the former home of Victorian society painter Frank Owen Salisbury. Though Joseph’s photographs are now considered “among the best ever” taken of The Stones, a dispute between the band and their record label saw a plain R.S.V.P. invitation card used for the cover, which was later replaced by the infamous photograph of a graffiti-covered toilet.
Michael Joseph was born in Kimberly – the Capital of South Africa’s Northern Cape Province – in 1941. His father was heavily involved in Anti-Apartheid activities, especially fundraising, and all of this gave Michael Joseph early exposure to politicians and social reportage from South Africa. Then, while at London College of Prints and Graphic Arts, Michael Joseph was sent to Vietnam to photograph the war. The images that came about as a result of this trip lead to 33 years of varied advertising assignments – with such companies as Benson and Hedges, Christies, Nivea, Pirelli, Malaysian Airlines, Schweppes and White Horse. He also worked in the fashion industry for Hart, Schaffner and Marks in Chicago. Based on Joseph’s extensive advertising portfolio, he was chosen by the Stones for the “Beggar’s Banquet” shoot.

In 1995 the travel writer David Saunders approached Michael Joseph to do a course book on photography. 600 of his images appeared in this publication. This was immediately followed by an illustrated version of “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” which donned the cover of the book by Douglas Adams.  Currently, Michael Joseph has returned to the world of photography after a three-year hiatus. His hobbies are art, creative gardening, tennis, photography and photographic printing. His wine farm in Entre Deux-mer also keeps him fairly occupied.  Michael Joseph contributed to the Decca Years Show with 8 outakes of his Beggar’s Banquet sessions.
