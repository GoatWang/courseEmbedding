	(Unaudited)




	 


	NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION
	OF BUSINESS


	 


	Vican Resources, Inc. (the “Company”)
	was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 5, 2002 under the name of “Tremont Fair, Inc.”
	From July 2009 until May 2011, the Company operated as a real estate services firm, seeking to capitalize on the real estate opportunities
	resulting from the dislocation in the credit markets, and by extension, the multifamily housing market, by acquiring, rehabilitating,
	stabilizing and selling distressed multifamily properties in the southern United States, predominantly in Texas. On May 26, 2011,
	the Company changed its name to Vican Resources, Inc. and changed its business model when it sold the real estate services division
	and acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vican Trading, Inc., a Montreal-based purchaser and seller of metals, ores, and other
	commodities (hereafter, “Vican Trading”). Upon the acquisition of Vican Trading, there was an implied option for either
	party to rescind the original acquisition. During the year that option was exercised and on December 20, 2011, the Company again
	changed its business when it unwound the acquisition of Vican Trading and acquired all of the assets of Med Ex Direct, Inc., a
	Florida-based provider of management services in respect of the distribution of diabetic supplies, principally to Hispanic patients
	(hereafter, “Med Ex Florida”). On March 22, 2012, the Company again changed its business to become an oil and gas exploration,
	development and distribution company when we unwound the purchase of the assets of Med Ex Florida and acquired three separate working
	interests in two oil and gas wells located in Jefferson County, Mississippi. In consideration of the assignments the Company is
	to pay all costs and expenses associated with the development of the working interests. To date there have been no costs incurred
	or required.


	 


	NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION


	 


	The accompanying unaudited interim
	financial statements of Vican Resources, Inc. ("the Company") have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
	generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read
	in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company’s annual report filed with
	the SEC on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal
	recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods
	presented have been reflected herein. Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are not necessarily indicative
	of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2017. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially
	duplicate the disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent year 2016 as reported in Form 10-K
	have been omitted.


	 


	NOTE 3 - BASIC AND DILUTED NET
	LOSS PER SHARE


	 


	The Company follows ASC Topic
	260 to account for the earnings per share. Basic earnings (loss) per common share (“EPS”) calculations are determined
	by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings
	(loss) per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares
	and dilutive common share equivalents (if dilutive) outstanding.

	NOTE 7 - COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK
	TRANSACTIONS


	 


	On September 24, 2013, the Company
	converted a certain promissory note, in the original principal amount of $400,000 held by Cumbria Capital, L.P. (“Cumbria”),
	into 100 shares of Series A Preferred Stock. Cumbria is a Texas limited partnership owned and controlled by Cyrus Boga, a director
	of the Company from December 15, 2011 to May 27, 2014. Although the Preferred Stock carries no dividend, distribution, or liquidation
	rights, and is not convertible into common stock, each share of Series A Preferred Stock carries 10,000,000 votes per share and
	is entitled to vote with the Company’s common stockholders on all matters upon which common stockholders may vote. As a result,
	Cumbria held a controlling voting interest in the Company to April 5, 2017 and Mr. Boga could unilaterally determine the election
	of the Board and other substantive matters requiring approval of the Company’s stockholders.


	 


	On September 24, 2013, the Company
	converted 1,825,000 shares of our Series C Preferred Stock (“Series C Conversion”), which amount represented all of
	the issued and outstanding shares of Series C Preferred Stock, into 1,825,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock. As a result
	of this conversion, there are no shares of Series C Preferred Stock outstanding. Immediately following the Series C Conversion,
	the Board of Directors of the Company approved the Plan of Share Exchange (the "Plan"). The Plan allowed for the conversion
	of 1,914,840,019 shares of Class A common stock, which amount represented all of the outstanding shares of common stock

	B common stock outstanding.


	 


	NOTE 8 – GAIN ON SETTLEMENT OF DEBT


	 


	As discussed in Notes 4 and 5
	above, certain vendors and creditors in March 2017 agreed to waive amounts due them in connection with negotiations relating to
	the change in control transaction on April 5, 2017 (see Note 11). The gain on settlement of debt of $671,585 for the three months
	ended March 31, 2017 consists of:

	NOTE 9 - INCOME TAXES


	 


	The Financial Accounting Standards
	Board (FASB) has issued FASB ASC 740-10.  FASB ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized
	in an enterprise's financial statements.  This standard requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not
	that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position.  If the more-likely-than-
	not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements.
	 As a result of the implementation of this standard, the Company performed a review of its material tax positions in accordance
	with recognition and measurement standards established by FASB ASC 740-10.  


	 


	Deferred taxes are provided on
	a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit
	carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.  Temporary differences are the
	differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by
	a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax
	assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and
	rates on the date of enactment.


	 


	At March 31, 2017 the Company
	had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $3,100,000 that may be offset against future taxable income through 2037.
	No tax benefits have been reported in the financial statements, because the potential tax benefits of the net operating loss carry
	forwards are offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.


	 


	Due to the change in ownership
	provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject
	to annual limitations. Therefore, net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in the future.

	NOTE 10 - GOING CONCERN UNCERTAINTY


	 


	The accompanying financial statements
	have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and
	satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has sustained significant net losses which have resulted
	in an accumulated deficit at March 31, 2017 of $3,097,562, has negative working capital, and negative cash flows from operations,
	all of which raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The Company believes these conditions
	have resulted from the inherent risks associated with small companies. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the ability
	to (i) generate revenues and sales of its products and services at levels sufficient to cover its costs and provide a return for
	investors, (ii) attract additional capital in order to finance growth, (iii) further develop and successfully market commercial
	products and services, and (iv) successfully compete with other comparable companies having financial, production and marketing
	resources significantly greater than those of the Company.


	 


	On April 5, 2017 (see Note 11), there
	was a change in control of the Company. We expect to be dependent on additional debt and equity financing to develop our new business
	but we cannot assure you that any such financings will be available or will otherwise be made on terms acceptable to us, or that
	our present shareholders might suffer substantial dilution as a result.


	 


	The financial statements do not include
	any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	Notes to the Financial Statements


	March 31, 2017


	(Unaudited)




	 




	NOTE 11
	- SUBSEQUENT EVENTS


	 


	On April 5, 2017, Ian Jenkins
	acquired 1,830,000 shares of common stock of the Company, representing approximately 94.2% of the issued and outstanding shares
	of common stock from the previous majority shareholders of the Company. Mr. Jenkins also acquired 100 shares of Series A Preferred
	Stock, representing all of the issued and outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company. Consequently, Mr. Jenkins
	unilaterally controls the election of the Company’s Board of Directors, all matters upon which shareholder approval is required,
	and ultimately, the direction of the Company.


	 


	On April 11, 2017, the Company
	issued a Convertible Promissory Note (“Note”) to an accredited investor. The Note has an aggregate principal amount
	of $500,000, matures one year from the date of issuance (the “Maturity Date”), and bears an interest rate of 8% per
	annum. The holder may convert the Note at any time up to the Maturity Date into shares of the Company’s common stock at a
	conversion price equal to $1.00 per share. The Company may prepay the Note prior to the Maturity Date and/or the date of conversion
	without penalty upon receiving the written consent of the holder.


	 


	On April 11, 2017, the Company
	executed a Share Exchange Agreement with Unprescribed, LLC (“Unprescribed”) and the members of Unprescribed, including
	Ian Jenkins, Chief Executive Officer and majority shareholder, Dr. Gregory Mongean and Christopher Dean (the “Members). Pursuant
	to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to exchange the outstanding membership interests of Unprescribed held by the
	Members for an aggregate of 25,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company. Ian Jenkins, the holder of 1,830,000 shares of common
	stock and 100 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, agreed to cancel such shares as of and at the Closing. Other than Mr. Jenkins,
	shareholders of the Company’s common stock hold approximately 109,907 shares, which will remain unchanged by the Share Exchange
	Agreement. In addition, at the Closing, the holders of an aggregate of approximately $1,357,000 of outstanding convertible notes
	issued by the Company have agreed to limit conversion of such debt to a maximum of 8,500,000 shares of common stock and the remaining
	debt will be cancelled.


	 


	The Share Exchange Agreement
	is subject to completion of certain conditions precedent to closing, including Uprescribed’s delivery of audited financial
	statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016.

	Forward-Looking Statements




	 



	This report contains forward-looking
	statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend and similar
	expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. You should not place too much reliance on these forward-looking statements.
	Our actual results are likely to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons.


	 



	Plan of Operation




	 



	Vican Resources, Inc. (hereafter,
	“we”, “our”, “us”, or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on
	September 5, 2002. From July 2009 until May 2011, we operated as a real estate services firm, seeking to capitalize on the real
	estate opportunities resulting from the dislocation in the credit markets, and by extension, the multifamily housing market, by
	acquiring, rehabilitating, stabilizing and selling distressed multifamily properties in the southern United States, predominantly
	in Texas.


	 


	On May 26, 2011, we changed
	our business when we sold our real estate services division and acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vican Trading, Inc.,
	a Montreal-based purchaser and seller of metals, ores, and other commodities (hereafter, “Vican Trading”). Upon the
	acquisition of Vican Trading, there was an implied option for either party to rescind the original acquisition. During the year
	that option was exercised and on December 20, 2011, we again changed our business when we unwound the acquisition of Vican Trading
	and acquired all of the assets of Med Ex Direct, Inc., a Florida-based provider of management services in respect of the distribution
	of diabetic supplies, principally to Hispanic patients (hereafter, “Med Ex Florida”). On March 21-22, 2012, we again
	changed our business to become an oil & gas exploration, development, and distribution company when we unwound the purchase
	of the assets of Med Ex Florida and received assignments for three separate working interests in two oil and gas wells located
	in Jefferson County, Mississippi.



	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	As of March 31, 2017, the
	Company’s primary source of liquidity consisted of $-0- in cash and cash equivalents. Since inception, the Company has financed
	its operations through a combination of short and long-term loans, and through the private placement of its common stock.


	 


	The Company has sustained
	significant net losses which have resulted in a total stockholders’ deficit at March 31, 2017 of $1,179,704 and is currently
	experiencing a substantial shortfall in operating capital which raises doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a
	going concern. The Company anticipates a net loss for the year ending December 31, 2017 and with the expected cash requirements
	for the coming months, without additional cash inflows from an increase in revenues combined with continued cost-cutting or a receipt
	of cash from capital investment, there is substantial doubt as to the Company’s ability to continue operations.


	 


	We may seek to secure additional
	debt or equity capital to finance substantial business development initiatives. There is presently no agreement in place with any
	source of financing for the Company and there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise any additional funds,
	or that such funds will be available on acceptable terms. Funds raised through future equity financing will likely be substantially
	dilutive to current shareholders. Lack of additional funds will materially affect the Company and its business, and may cause the
	Company to cease operations. Consequently, shareholders could incur a loss of their entire investment in the Company.

	Results of Operations




	 



	From July 2009 until May
	2011, we operated as a real estate services firm, seeking to capitalize on the real estate opportunities resulting from the dislocation
	in the credit markets, and by extension, the multifamily housing market, by acquiring, rehabilitating, stabilizing and selling
	distressed multifamily properties in the southern United States, predominantly in Texas.


	 


	On May 26, 2011, we changed
	our business when we sold our real estate services division and acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vican Trading, Inc.,
	a Montreal-based purchaser and seller of metals, ores, and other commodities (hereafter, “Vican Trading”). Upon the
	acquisition of Vican Trading, there was an implied option for either party to rescind the original acquisition. During the year
	that option was exercised and on December 20, 2011, we again changed our business when we unwound the acquisition of Vican Trading

	the assets of Med Ex Florida and received assignments for three separate working interests in two oil and gas wells located in
	Jefferson County, Mississippi.


	 



	Revenues

	. For the
	three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, net revenues were $-0-.


	 



	Selling General and
	Administrative Expense.

	Selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $26,129
	compared to $53,585 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The Company expects selling, general and administrative expenses
	to increase in the future.


	 



	Other Income (Expenses).

	Other income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $650,036 compared to other expenses of $21,789 for the three months
	ended March 31, 2016. Included in this category is interest expense related to promissory notes issued by the Company. During the
	three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company recorded a gain on the settlement of debt in the amount of $671,585.



	 




	Net Income (Loss).

	Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $623,907 compared to a net loss of $75,374 for the three months ended
	March 31, 2016.


	 



	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We do not have any off
	balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes
	in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that
	is material to investors.



	 




	Personnel



	 


	Vican Resources has no
	full-time employees, but utilizes other project-based contract personnel to carry out our business. We utilize contract personnel
	on a continuous basis, primarily in connection with the filing of reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission which require
	a high level of specialization for one or more of the service components offered.

	Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
	About Market Risk.



	 


	Not Required.




	 








	Item 4. Controls and Procedures.



	 


	The Securities and Exchange
	Commission defines the term “disclosure controls and procedures” to mean a Company's controls and other procedures
	of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under
	the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities
	and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures
	designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934 is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive and principal
	financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
	The Company maintains such a system of controls and procedures in an effort to ensure that all information which it is required
	to disclose in the reports it files under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
	the time periods specified under the SEC's rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated
	to principal executive and principal financial officers to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure.


	 


	As of the end of the period
	covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the chief executive
	officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.
	Based on this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures
	are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the objectives of timely alerting them to material information required
	to be included in the Company’s periodic SEC reports and of ensuring that such information is recorded, processed, summarized
	and reported within the time periods specified. The Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer also concluded
	that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report to provide reasonable
	assurance of the achievement of these objectives.



	 




	Changes in Internal Control over Financial
	Reporting



	 


	There have been no significant
	changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 that have materially
	or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
