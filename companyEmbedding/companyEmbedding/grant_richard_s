About











 


It was in 1997 when Grant Richards first started DJing, but vinyl had been a bigger part of his life long before that, a youth reared on classic Motown and raw funk driving a fascination with shiny black plastic. 
1999 wasn’t just the title of a great Prince song, it was also a pivotal year for Grant, a succession of opportunities leading him to the world of dance music in a more serious role. 
He was rapidly ensconced in the world of DJing, promoting and producing where he quickly ascertained a full time position at House-heavyweight Kinky Malinki. It was here he would develop the essential talent in balancing these duties, not only for the benefit of himself but also for the brand that would forge his early identity.
Grant’s enthusiasm for dance music is tangible, his image completely removed from the stone faced jock that remains unmoved by the music. When he DJs he really performs, allowing the music to move him just as frequently as the dancers who crowd in front of him, yet never losing concentration on delivering the end product to devastating effect. It’s a passion and genuine love that makes him just as likely to be on the same floors he controls, spending countless hours shuffling his feet, adorned with a pair from his beloved sneaker collection, to the grooves and beats of the many DJs he admires.
The past few years have been a memorable experience for Grant, his lofty position at the elite of London’s up and coming stars solidified. His versatility is imbued by his alluring knack of crafting some of the most diverse DJ sets around. Comfortable layering lush deep house numbers as part of intricately textured warm up sets, he’s then equally as efficient in striking out the big room monsters for some peak time goodness. Never pigeonholed, he’s built his reputation on across the board musical knowledge and a keen ear for translating this to dancefloor pandemonium, the core requisite of any great DJ. This fact was recognized when he was nominated for best newcomer in the 2005 house music awards, alongside Dutch sensations Hardsoul and eventual winners the Shapeshifters.
As Kinky Malinki’s resident he’s traveled the globe bringing the kinky vibes to destinations as far flung as Jakarta, Singapore and Egypt’s Pacha, an achievement further intensified by his pivotal role in the compiling and mixing of the Kinky Malinki series of compilations.
The past has already been glorious, but it’s Grants future that really bubbles with glittering intent. With over 15 years of professional toil, it is merely the start for a man who oozes passion for music, a DJ, promoter and producer who looks set to enrich the scene for a lot longer yet.

Stunning speaker systems


            
                Richard Grant (UK): +44 ( 0) 7802 987 147     
  Grammy nominated Professional musician & Producer “Adam Wakeman” reviewed a pair of “rgproduct” speakers during a mastering session: “…clarity and depth…beautiful, innovative designs…amazing stereo imagery…”  read more…   

    Quite simply an awesome object in a beautiful natural aged stone finish. The Medallion can be finished in bespoke colours and a Gold finish option shown below: The latest technology in drive units is incorporated in the Medallion mount. Features dynamic 55 Hz to 16 KHz fatigue free listening response; utilising pure drive unit technology has no extraneous circuitry to hinder audio performance. Enclosure material is a tough Polymer “cold ceramic” offering minimal audio colouration or distortion as well as high weather resistance. I Recommend using High Fidelity Amplification providing minimum 50 to 100w/channel. Connect using discrete banana type socket connection; Easy fix Banana plugs provided with each unit.           Pricing & Finish options (per single unit): 
  Aged Stone/matching medallion:£2,750.00 (approx $4,400)       Aged Stone/Contrast  medallion:£2,995.00 (approx $4,800)     
   An heirloom quality speaker Designed and hand made in England featuring Luxury soft Gold finish with contrast Natural Raffia detail. The latest technology in drive units is incorporated in the 3rd Eye position of enlightenment. Features dynamic 55 Hz to 16 KHz fatigue free listening response; utilising pure drive unit technology has no extraneous circuitry to hinder audio performance.  Enclosure material is a tough Polymer “cold ceramic” offering minimal audio colouration or distortion. Amplification requirements, technical and shipping as per rgproduct:Olympian. 
     Pricing & Finish options (per single unit):                            Aged Stone/Natural Raffia:   £2,750.00 (approx 4,400 USD)       Antique Gold/Colour Raffia: £2,995.00 ( approx 4,800 USD)
Raffia detail and finish colour can be amended to suit your thematic and design needs (cost option). Please email me with your requirements.     

           I recommend an intentionally  miss-matched pair or quad arrangement to really enliven your home with art works both beautiful and practical. Imagine Four stunning sculpture pieces, each historic and rare. One in each corner of your viewing room providing your surround system audio. Or a selection of ancient architectural detritus, each filling your interior or exterior environment with music. 
   

One-off designs in pairs or batches to suit corporate branding, interior design and Restaurant/Retail environments or any marketing concept. Please email your inquiry or call +44(0)7802 987 147.   © Richard Grant/www.rgproduct.com 1996 – 2012. Final products may differ from pre-visualisation images above (in a good way and due to technical and design improvements).

Grant Richards - Deeptrak, Kinky Malinki | The Best Smelling DJ in the Game


















































































 Menu						





























 

"Grant’s enthusiasm for dance music is tangible, his image completely removed from the stone faced jock that remains unmoved by the music. When he DJs he really performs, allowing the music to move him just as frequently as the dancers who crowd in front of him, yet never losing concentration on delivering the end product to devastating effect"
His Mom.

2016 – My Best Bits


January 3, 2017
Grant Richards

Blog 


It’s pretty fair to say that 2016 isn’t going to go down as a classic, or if it does it’s for the wrong reasons: Brexit, Trump and the unfortunate passing of many iconic musicians. To look at the positives on a personal tip, I’ve enjoyed interviewing individuals that I’ve respected and looked up to for […]

If you have reached your mid-30s, dabbled in London life and been a clubber or DJ (or both), there is a high chance that your musical progression went something along the lines of this: Rave/Jungle/D&B to UK Garage to House Music. This was my musical path and there are still a legion of white van […]

One is the shy Caroline Helstone, who is trapped in the oppressive atmosphere of a Yorkshire rectory and whose bare life symbolizes the plight of single women in the nineteenth century. The other is the vivacious Shirley Keeldar, who inherits a local estate and whose wealth liberates her from convention. A work that combines social commentary with the more private preoccupations of Jane Eyre, Shirley demonstrates the full range of Bronte's literary talent.Features; The World’s Classics Series XIV Publisher Grant Richards, London; 1903Burgundy Cloth Hardback With Gilt Title, 645ppSize 160 x 110mm, 450gCondition: Good – No Dust Jacket, No Inscriptions, Slight Rubbing To Edges, Good Copy5 Good Reasons To BUY NOW !!!
