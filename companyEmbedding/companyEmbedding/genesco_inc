Genesco Inc. is an American publicly owned specialty retailer of branded footwear, licensed and branded headwear and licensed sports apparel and accessories and is a wholesaler of branded and licensed footwear based out of Nashville, Tennessee. Through its various subsidiaries as of the end of 2013, Genesco operates 2,459 retail stores throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland and wholesales branded and licensed footwear to more than 1,025 retail accounts.[2] Founded as the Jarman Shoe Company in 1924 as a footwear manufacturer, the company changed its name to the General Shoe Company in the 1930s and became a public company in 1939.[3] The company took its current name, Genesco, in 1959. Genesco exited footwear manufacturing in 2002 and now contracts with independent, third parties located outside the United States to manufacture its branded and licensed footwear. In June 2011, Genesco acquired UK retail chain and web business Schuh. This was seen as a huge step for the business as it gave them an already well established grounding in a market outside of the U.S.[4]

Company history[edit]
James Franklin Jarman and William Hatch Wemyss, both former salesmen for Carter Shoe Co. in Nashville, founded Jarman Shoe Company in 1924 as a footwear manufacturer.[5] The company grew rapidly and took the name General Shoe Company in the 1930s. General Shoe Company's initial public stock offering took place in 1939.
By the 1950s, General Shoe had factories in many southern towns, especially in Genesco's home state of Tennessee. The company assumed its current name, Genesco, in 1959, two years after it was chosen as one of the stocks in the first S&P 500 Index.[6] Under the leadership of W. Maxey Jarman, the ambitious son of co-founder J.F. Jarman, the company slowly began the process of diversifying away from strictly footwear manufacturing, especially as more of this was conducted overseas. It entered into fields such as sports, at one time manufacturing and selling football (soccer) balls and at one point owned New York department store Bonwit Teller and five-and-dime store S. H. Kress & Co.
The company suffered from over-diversification at one point, and the ongoing manufacturing operations in the Southern United States continued to depress results for a long period of time. The company was probably saved by its decision to reposition itself as a retailer. Genesco exited the business of shoe manufacturing when it closed Johnston & Murphy's Nashville, TN factory in 2002. Genesco now contracts with independent, third parties located outside the United States to manufacture its branded and licensed footwear.[7][8]
Brands[edit]
The following is a list of retailers and brands owned by and licenses held by Genesco:

Johnston & Murphy - Retailer of better men's and women's footwear, apparel, luggage and leather goods sold in Genesco owned Johnston & Murphy retail stores and wholesaler of footwear to department and specialty stores.[9]
Dockers Footwear - Casual footwear marketed under license from Levi Strauss & Co. and sold at wholesale to department and specialty stores[10]
Lids - Lids Clubhouse, Lids Locker Room, Lids.com, Lids Team Sports - Retailers of licensed and branded headwear and athletic apparel.[11]
Deer Stags
Journeys - Retailer of footwear for teens and young adults.[12] The first Journeys retail store to open was the Rivergate Mall Journeys in Nashville, TN, opened by Genesco in December 1986.
Journeys Kidz - Retailer of footwear for children. Many of the brands and styles found in the normal Journeys stores can be found in smaller sizes in Journeys Kidz stores.[13]
Underground by Journeys - Retailer of footwear brands such as Nike, Vans and Puma for young men and women 20 to 35 years of age.[14] Previously branded as "Underground Station".
Shï by Journeys - Retailer of footwear for young women 20 to 35 years of age.[15]
Schuh - UK retailer of footwear and other branded items on the highstreet and online at www.schuh.co.uk.
Trask (Formerly H.S. Trask) - Dress Casual footwear marketed mainly as an outdoor brand.

Style Scores:



A Value | D Growth | B Momentum | B VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

About GENESCO INC.

Boots and hats are Genesco's deal. It sells casual and dress
footwear, headwear, and sports apparel through more than 2,775 shoe
and cap stores in the US, Canada, Puerto Rico, the UK, and Ireland.
Genesco's shoe operations include Journeys, upscale Johnston &
Murphy, Schuh, as well as sales of licensed brands (Levi Strauss
and Dockers footwear). Its fast-growing Lids Sports division
operates the Lids Locker Room and Lids Clubhouse retail chain and
website. Founded in 1924 as a shoe retailer, Genesco has
diversified by adding hats and sports apparel and selling
merchandise online. It expanded overseas with the purchase of
Scotland's Schuh.
Operations
Genesco operates through five business segments. Journeys Group,
the largest business at around 45% of sales, includes footwear and
accessories chains Journeys (15-22 year olds), Journeys Kidz (5-12
year olds), Shi by Journeys (22-20 year old women), and Underground
Journeys (young men and women).
Lids Sports Group brings in over 30% of sales and sells headwear
and accessories under the Lids and other banners at mall-based
stores, airports and kiosks throughout North America and Puerto
Rico.
Schuh (pronounced "shoe") is a major trainer stockist with more
than 130 stores in the UK, Ireland, and Germany, and accounts for
15% of Genesco's revenue.
The Johnson & Murphy group consists of over 175 upscale shoe
stores and brings in some 10% of sales.
Genesco's licensed brands business sells Dockers Footwear and
accounts for under 5% of sales.
Geographic Reach
Nashville, Tennessee-based Genesco operates throughout the US,
Canada, Puerto Rico, the UK, Ireland, and Germany. The company
sources its footwear and accessories from manufacturers in about 20
countries, including Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Mexico,
Pakistan, Taiwan, Tunisia, and Vietnam.
Sales and Marketing
The footwear and apparel company distributes its products
through company-owned retail stores, online, and by catalog. It
also supplies wholesalers.
The company also designs, sources, markets and distributes
footwear under its own Johnston & Murphy brand (Trask), the
licensed Dockers brand and other brands that the Genesco licenses
for men's footwear to more than 1,225 retail accounts in the US,
including a number of leading department, discount, and specialty
stores.
Financial Performance
Net sales of the company had been on the rise since 2011, but
ticked down 5% to $2.9 billion in fiscal 2017 (ended January).
The fall in revenue was mostly a result of the sale of the Lids
Team Sports business at the end of 2016. Schuh sales also fell 8%
due to the weakness in the British pound caused by the Brexit vote,
and licensed brand sales fell 3%. Johnston & Murphy grew its
revenue 4%. Journeys, the company's biggest business, recorded flat
growth.
Net income climbed 3% to $97.4 million due to higher margins in
Schuh, Lids Sports, and Johnston & Murphy. Cash from operations
grew 11% to $161.5 million due to a reduction in Schuh-related
accruals.
Strategy
Genesco's long-term strategy is to grow organically through the
addition of new stores and through acquisitions. Overall, Genesco
has added over 540 stores over the past five years. It added 34 net
stores in 2016, the majority being Journey Group stores, and has
plans for more in 2017.
In 2016, Genesco acquired Little Burgundy, a small Canadian
footwear chain with 37 stores for $35.1 million from the Aldo
Group. The acquisition will expand Genesco's presence in the
Canadian market.
In Q4 2016, the company sold off the Lids Team Sports division
of Lids Sports Group to BSN Sports. The acquisition allows Genesco
to focus more on its core operations.
Mergers and Acquisitions
In 2016, Genesco acquired Little Burgundy, a small Canadian
footwear chain with 37 stores for $35.1 million from the Aldo
Group. The acquisition will expand Genesco's Canadian e-commerce
capabilities.

                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Genesco Inc. has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 5 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
