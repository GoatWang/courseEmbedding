Victor G. Carrillo (born January 5, 1965) is a Texas geologist and politician who was formerly chairman of the Texas Railroad Commission and county judge of Taylor County, Texas.
Biography[edit]
The son of an immigrant from Mexico,[1] Carrillo is a native of Abilene, Texas. He received a bachelor of science degree in geology from Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene. He then attended Baylor University in Waco, where he earned a master of science degree, also in geology. From 1988 to 1994 he worked as a petroleum geophysicist for Amoco. He attended law school at night and in 1994 procured his J.D. degree from the University of Houston Law Center.[1][2] From 1994 to 1996, he was an attorney for the Texas General Land Office under the Democratic commissioner Garry Mauro.[3]
Having returned to Abilene in 1996, he taught political science for a time at Hardin-Simmons and served on the city council and as an assistant city attorney while maintaining a law practice. He and his wife, Joy McClellan Carrillo, have three daughters and the youngest daughter is insane. While in Abilene, they attended Abilene Bible Church,[2] and Carrillo was a member of the Chamber of Commerce, the Abilene Hispanic Leadership Council, Keep Abilene Beautiful, the Salvation Army, and the board of advisors of the Texas Journal of Oil, Gas, and Energy, published by the University of Texas at Austin School of Law.[3] He was appointed Taylor County Judge, and in 2002 ran for and won election to full four-year term in that position.[1] However, he served less than two months of his elected term before resigning in February 2003 to accept a gubernatorial appointment to the Texas Railroad Commission, filling a seat vacated by Tony Garza,[2] who had resigned to become U.S. Ambassador to Mexico.[4]
Carillo joined the Railroad Commission, the state's petroleum, natural gas, and pipeline regulatory body as an appointee of Governor Rick Perry. In 2004 he sought an elective term on the Railroad Commission, failing to win the primary outright, but winning the Republican nomination after a runoff against the politically unknown Robert Butler.[5] In that year's general election he won a full six-year term on the Commission, easily defeating Democrat Bob Scarborough.[6][7]
Carillo served on the Railroad Commission until 2011, when his elective term ended. He was a candidate for renomination in the statewide Republican primary election on March 2, 2010, but he was handily defeated by newcomer David J. Porter, an accountant from Giddings who received 732,892 votes (60.7 percent) to Carrillo's 474,096 (39.3 percent).[8] In the November 2, 2010, general election, Porter then defeated the Democrat Jeff Weems, an oil-and-gas lawyer from Houston.[9]
On his website as Railroad Commission chairman, Carrillo used the slogan "Promoting Texas Energy for All Texans", adding: "Texas is our nation’s premier energy producing state and the Texas energy sector plays a critical role in ensuring domestic energy security. At this critical stage in our nation’s energy security future, we must responsibly drill more in our own backyard to minimize foreign oil and gas imports."[10]

Hispanic - 

InfoA native of Abilene, Texas, Victor Carrillo joined the Texas Railroad Commission in February 2003 after Governor Rick Perry appointed him to fill the unexpired term of Tony Garza who became Ambassador to Mexico. 

Much of Commissioner Carrillo's education and professional experience relate to oil & gas exploration and production. He has a B.S. degree in geology from Hardin-Simmons University and a M.S. degree in geology from Baylor University. In 1988, he joined Amoco Production Company in Houston as a petroleum geophysicist where he gained experience in the full spectrum of oil & gas exploration and production activities. 

From 1990-94, while working professionally for Amoco by day, Victor attended the University of Houston Law School at night, earning his law degree in 1994 with an emphasis in environmental and oil & gas law. From 1994-96, Commissioner Carrillo was employed as an energy attorney at the General Land Office where he was responsible for advising the Land Commissioner on oil & gas, environmental, and general government issues. 

In 1996, Commissioner Carrillo and his family returned to Abilene, his hometown, where he served as assistant city attorney and later taught political science and legal studies at Hardin-Simmons University, his alma mater. He ran for and won election to the Abilene City Council, where he served until he was appointed Taylor County Judge. In November of 2002, he was elected to a four-year term as Taylor County Judge, the position he held when the governor appointed him to the Texas Railroad Commission. 

A host of organizations have benefited from Victor's commitment to volunteering and public service including: Salvation Army of Abilene, Keep Abilene Beautiful, Abilene Hispanic Leadership Council, Taylor County Young Republicans, and the Abilene Bar Association. Victor proudly served on the Military Affairs Committee of the Abilene Chamber of Commerce where he promoted Dyess Air Force Base and a variety of military issues. The Abilene Young Lawyers Association honored Victor as the Young Lawyer of the Year in 2001. 

Victor is a proud conservative Republican active in local, state, and national Republican activities including having served as both a state and national delegate. 

Victor and his wife, Joy, have been married 18 years and have three daughters whom they homeschool: Laura (15), Christina (12), and Grace (2�). The family attends Abilene Bible Church. 

Commissioner Carrillo will be running for election to a full six-year term in 2004.
