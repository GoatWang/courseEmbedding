Expert ReviewedwikiHow to Sell a Product
Three Methods:Showing Enthusiasm for the ProductConnecting with the BuyerSelling Products as an Owner SalespersonCommunity Q&A
Selling a product doesn’t have to be complicated. At its most basic level, a sales program is defined principally by what you sell, who you sell it to and how you sell it. Beyond that, sales involves staying focused on the details of your product and customers. As a sales program continues you will want to keep paying attention to changing trends and the needs or desires of your customers. By observing these changes you will be able to adjust your program and keep your sales strong.







Steps


Method 1

Showing Enthusiasm for the Product







1

Study your product.[1] If you are able to convey knowledge about the product, and to answer questions that customers may have, then they will understand that you really care about the product. If you find the product worthwhile, they are more likely to as well.


It is absolutely vital to know your product inside out. If you do not know something a customer asks of you, try saying something like “I don’t know the exact answer for that, but I’ll be happy to look into it and get back to you right away. What’s the best way to contact you when I find the answer?”









2

Emphasize the perks of the product to customers. As well as getting good product information to the right people, it is important to translate the product's features into benefits. This makes it easier for the customer to see why they should purchase the product. Think about things like:[2]

Will the product make the customer’s life easier?
Will the product create a sense of luxury?
Is the product something that can be enjoyed by many people?
Is the product something that can be used for a long time?








3

Ensure that the product has been adequately explained. If you are not doing direct, person-to-person sales, then you will need to ensure that good product information is supplied via retail packaging, point-of-purchase displays, and any marketing materials.[3] Even if you are selling products directly or making a pitch, having good product information on display will help you convince customers.[4][5]

Make sure that all product information is informative, true, and complete.
Make sure that the language on product packaging and marketing materials is clear, direct, and easy to read.
Invest the time and money to ensure that your product, packaging, and marketing materials look good—high-quality photos, vivid colors, etc.










Method 2

Connecting with the Buyer







1

Share your love of the product.[6][7] A good salesperson believes in the product that is being sold, and transfers this enthusiasm to the customer. There are numerous ways to show your love of a product.


Don’t neglect body language and tone. You will convey energy and enthusiasm if you speak clearly about a product, and show expression when discussing it. On the other hand, if you mumble when customers ask questions about a product, or cross your arms over your chest, then it will appear like you are distant and don’t care about the product.
Be prepared to discuss how you use the product, or how other satisfied customers have. Specific stories about the product make it relatable to customers. For instance, if you’re selling a shampoo, you can tell a customer something like: “My hair is usually so frizzy, but ever since I’ve started using this it’s been as smooth and straight as it is right now.”








2

Anticipate your customers’ motivations.[8]. You want to be able to answer any questions that customers may have about a product, but even more importantly, you want to anticipate those questions. This shows that you understand customer needs. Make sure that you are able to connect emotionally with customers by addressing those needs.[9]

Think about your typical customers. What motivates them? What needs do they have? Are they young? Single? Wealthy? Do they have families?
Once you have an idea of your customers in mind, think about how your product can help them meet their needs or reach their desires.








3

Practice breaking the ice with customers. If you are working in direct sales, the way you connect with people is critical. Instead of asking the close-ended question "May I help you?,” ask the more positive, open-ended questions like "Are you looking for something for yourself? Or a gift for someone special?"[10] In addition, be ready to make remarks about your product that will interest customers and start deeper conversations. For instance, if you are in clothing retail, you might say: “You know, ugly Christmas sweater parties are really popular right now. Have you ever been to one?”








4

Convert the customer's motivations into the product's characteristics. In marketing, this is known as "positioning," and it consists of equating the product with the customer's hopes and desires. A number of factors are important when positioning a product[11]:


Position the product in the best spectrum of the market possible. Don’t pitch the product too high or too low in terms of affordability and luxury.
Position the facts about the product according to the person you're selling it to. You may have a handful of different facts, but it's up to your skill to know which of those facts best serve each individual sale.
Don't fudge facts or lie outright. Product positioning is about perception, not deception.
Position the facts so that they transcend the product itself. This means that the desirable, positive values associated with the product are what sell it. Companies that excel at this include Coca-Cola, Apple, and many designer goods or labels. Think about how your product will connect with a customer’s lifestyle or values, and not simply serve a function.
For instance, if you are trying to sell a relatively high-end minivan to a wealthy older person, you might mention its luxurious features. Do this by saying things like: “Take a look at that wood trim—it’s just beautiful. And those soft leather seats—they’re so comfortable. They’re perfect for taking a nice sunset drive.”
If you were trying to sell the same minivan to a family with three children, however, you would emphasize its more utilitarian features. For example, you could say things like: “The third seat adds lots of room for carting friends around. It also folds down when you need room for hauling groceries, sporting gear, and things like that. And did I mention that side air bags and anti-lock brakes come standard?”








5

Be honest about your product. Long-term lovers of your product will only come about if you've been honest with them. This means being transparent in your delivery of product information and also admitting your own lack of knowledge or mistakes you've made. Don't be afraid of honesty; it builds trust.


If you ever are not able to answer customers’ questions or supply them with what they need, offer to follow up with them later, as soon as you are able to.
Make sure customers know they can come back to you later if they have questions or concerns.
If it ever turns out that a product isn’t right for a customer, be honest about it and help the customer find what he or she really needs.[12] Even if you don’t make the sale today, your honesty and generosity will be remembered, and can translate into future sales.
For instance, if you are trying to sell a sports car to customer who eventually tells you that he has five young children who he drives to school everyday, you could say something like: “Well maybe you’d be better off with a good minivan or SUV. But if you’re ever in the market for a second vehicle, come back and talk to me and I’ll help you get a good deal.”








6

Close the sale. There are many styles and methods of closing a sale, but one of the most effective has the mnemonic, ABC: "Always Be Closing."[13] As you confirm your prospective buyer's interest in the product, put forward trial closes like, "Does this sound like the product you want?" or “So what do you think? Will this meet your needs?”








7

Give customers time to consider. Appearing overly pushy is a turn-off for many buyers.[14] They may want to go home and do a quick online search for more information. Let them do so with your enthusiastic and supportive pitch in mind. If you've been truthful, helpful, considerate, and enthusiastic, and the information you've given them matches with what they read online, they are likely to come back to your product.


Sometimes, it pays to let your customers take the lead. Give them time to consider, and keep quiet while they do. Only offer more information when they request it.[15]

Don’t let customers get away without knowing how to contact you. If you are working in a store or on site, make sure customers will know how to find you again (especially if you will be moving around). Make sure to tell customers something like "I'll be right here at the counter if you need me," or "Just ask any sales associate to page me if you have any questions."
You can also give customers your contact information so they can get in touch with you if they have questions or want more information. Slip the customer your business card or other contact information and say something: "Call me anytime if you have questions, and you can also find me right here in the store on weekdays."
Use your instincts. If you think a customer is close to buying, stay nearby without being intrusive. You’ll want the customer to be able to find you quickly. The last thing you want is for a potential buyer to decide to purchase and then be unable to find you.










Method 3

Selling Products as an Owner Salesperson







1

Familiarize yourself with all aspects that feed into the end sale of a product. As an owner salesperson, that is, one who owns the business that is selling the product, you have the ability to affect more than just the interaction with buyers. In addition to the strategies mentioned in the rest of this article, you can also use other functions to improve your sales. Advertising, merchandising, and marketing are support functions for sales.[16] Selling is the goal of these support functions and a good owner salesperson needs to have a decent understanding of each of these.



Read basic texts on marketing. These will inform you about many of the tactics and techniques underlying advertising, merchandising, and marketing.








2

Market your product. It is important to make your product information available through as many channels as possible. Today, the range of potential placements has increased a great deal thanks to the advances in communications. Give your potential buyers many possible places to find out more about your product in numerous ways, such as:


Word-of-mouth
Advertising (radio, TV, print, email, social media, online ads, etc.)
Sales representatives
Trade shows
Conferences
Cold call sales
Product placement in movies, sports, etc.
Local community events (for instance, donating a product to a local benefit auction will draw attention to your product and serve a good cause)[17][18]









3

Review your sales performance.[19][20] You should analyze your sales at regular intervals. Is the product selling well? Is stock low or high? Are you profiting? How are your competitors performing? Being able to answer these questions will help you maximize your sales, and keep growth steady.








4

Troubleshoot sales, if necessary. If you are not selling well, you will need to enter problem-solving mode. Improving your sales will involve reassessing your product, customer base, and marketing.[21]

Change your tactics periodically. If customers hear the same sales routine over and over again, or see the same display month in and month out, your product might start to seem irrelevant.
Consider deleting a product from your line if it is not selling well. Stock can be sold at discounted prices to liquidate it.
Review your target market and sharpen your sales focus. Your buyers might be changing, and you will want to keep up with them, or else find a new market.
Re-evaluate the product design, distribution, packaging, etc. Tweaking the product with your target market and sales strategy in mind can improve your sales.
Change the price of your product. By studying your sales data and competitors’ performance, you may be able to tell if you are charging too much or too little for your product.
Make the product exclusive, or available for a limited time only. Sometimes, controlling supply in this way will increase demand and sales. Make sure that this tactic works with your overall sales strategy, however. If you are marketing a product as perfect for everyday use, it may not work to also market it as exclusive.

Consider the features of the boots and the benefit they provide to potential buyers. Focus on those features that bring the greatest value to the buyer such as utility, low price, extended life and durability, appearance, and status. Whether sold online or in a store, the customer always seeks the greatest value/cost advantage.

What should I do when I am a beginner in a sales job?



								
								wikiHow Contributor							

Look to the older and more experienced salespeople at the business for advice and try to emulate their behavior around customers. Make as many sales attempts as you can and actively learn from your mistakes by writing them down and seeking ways to correct them. Above all, don't get discouraged; making sales is difficult and nerve-wracking in the beginning, but gets easier over time.

How do you deal with a customer who always wants a bargain?



								
								wikiHow Contributor							

Any customer would like to negotiate with you on the price or services that are being provided. To close the deal with such customers who always bargain, you need to instill a sense in customer that the current price for goods or services being offered is the best. If you have anything to throw in, that can sometimes stop their requests, but if you can show it's the best price in town already, that is your best chances of shutting down the bargaining.

How can we understand customer behavior?

The best way to understand customers is to put yourself in their shoes. If you were about to buy your product, what would you want to know more about? What would you be worried about?

We are creatures of habit. American families, on average, buy the same 150 products over and over again, which make up 85 percent of their household needs, according to research out of Harvard Business School. So how can you get people to take a chance on your new business and become loyal customers?
The trick is helping customers overcome their initial hesitation and making your new item speak to customers in a relatable way.
Here are five ways to help your product sell itself in a crowded marketplace:
1. Broadcast your advantage. What makes you better than everyone else in the industry? Be clear with customers from the start. Perceived advantage is built on factors like greater prestige, more convenience, superior effectiveness or better value for the money.
Even cleaning products, the most mundane of all consumer necessities, can win using this theory. For example, Mr. Clean Magic Erasers solved the problems that previous spray-on liquid cleaners claimed to, with the added advantage of not damaging the paint on walls as competitors' products did. The brand made this ability to remove touch marks without damaging walls clear through a TV ad campaign that demonstrated the product at work. This provided positive reinforcement to consumers before they made their purchase.
2. Fit into your customer's routine. How much effort is required for customers to make the transition from a current product to yours? If the cost is more than its relative advantage, most people won't try the new product. Febreze seems like one of those success stories -- and it is -- but even P&G can make mistakes with their branding, as was the case with Febreze Scentstories. In 2004, the company launched a $5.99 scent "player" that was reminiscent of a CD player with five scent discs that changed every half hour. Consumers were confused. They couldn't tell if the product played music, freshened air or did both. Not knowing how or why they would use it, they didn't.
3. Work right out of the box. When building new products, don't add work for the buyer. Make your product work as intended the first time out and every time thereafter. A kink-free garden hose, for example, should be kink free the first time and the hundredth time; a children's toy should be easy to assemble; and you should never expect a busy mom to spend more than five minutes figuring out how to use a new slow-cooker. 
4. Make benefits easy to spot. The more evident the perceived advantages, the more your product will market itself. For example, the clear plastic packaging of 3M's Command line of removable hooks allows you to see and understand how the product enables you to hang and remove a hook without leaving a hole in the wall.
5. Let customers try it out. Tea bags were first used as giveaways so that people could sample tea without buying large tins, vastly improving the "trial-ability" of brewed tea, and eventually tea bags. Samples, giveaways and store demonstrations are tried-and-true techniques for risk-free experimentation. If you can't afford to give your product away, offer a tempting discount or "buy one get one" deal. Depending on your product and core customer, you can use sites like Gilt.com or Travel Zoo to make enticing offers.
Local products or services benefit from actual social interaction: an informal gathering in a home where guests can "play" with the product or try the service, a farmer's or open-air market where consumers can touch and taste what you're selling and meet you. The easier something is to try, the faster customers will want to buy it.

Reader ApprovedwikiHow to Sell on eBay
Six Parts:Getting Started on eBayChoosing What to SellCreating Listings that SellCompleting the TransactionPromoting Your ListingsTips from Experienced SellersCommunity Q&A
Selling on eBay is a great way to sell or auction off items you no longer need. It allows you to reach more people than holding a simple garage sale. If you want some tips on how to sell on eBay, then this wikiHow is for you.








10 Second Summary

1. Click on "Sell" in "My eBay" or on the Main Page.
2. Enter a title for your listing.
3. Add pictures of your item and a description.
4. Set your price and the duration of your auction.
5. Double-check everything and save.



Steps


Part 1

Getting Started on eBay









1

Explore the site a bit. To find eBay, simply use your favorite search engine and type in eBay. eBay tailors its site to countries all over the world, so make sure that you are looking at your country's eBay site. For people in the United States, it is www.ebay.com.


Check out eBay's seller information pages[1]. These pages thoroughly discuss eBay's selling policies.
Experiment with eBay's search features, and browse a few listings. Knowing how eBay's search function works will help you make better listings.

Try changing the search results by changing the options in the "Sort" menu.
Keep a good eye on listings that appear at the top of the search results and those that appear to be receiving many bids.












2

Decide on a good account name. eBay can provide you with a name, but if you come up with an attractive name, it can increase the chances of selling. Avoid anything that is offensive or lowers the value of items you are selling. Per eBay's username policy:[2]

eBay usernames must have at least two characters and cannot contain symbols such as the at sign, ampersand (&), apostrophe, parentheses or less/greater-than signs, nor can they contain spaces or successive underscores. eBay usernames also cannot begin with a hyphen, period or underscore.
eBay does not allow the names of websites or email addresses as user IDs, nor does it allow anything with the word "eBay" or the letter "e" followed by several numbers. This avoids abuse by users who want to pose as eBay employees, or redirect customers to other, less reputable sites via eBay.
Don't use a trademarked name (such as a brand) unless you are the owner of it.
Names like "iselljunk" or "chickmagnet69" seem unprofessional and can repel buyers. Names that are hateful or obscene can be blocked by eBay.
Since so many people are already on eBay, spend some time checking that the name you want is actually available and come up with alternatives when your preferred name is already in use.
You can change your User ID later; however, you can only do this once every 30 days, and if frequently done, your repeat customers may be lost.[3]










3

Create an eBay account. Go to eBay's main page and look for the "sign in" link near the top of the page. Enter your name and a valid email address and choose a password (must have 6-64 characters and contain at least one letter and one symbol). You will be asked to choose a username after you do this.


eBay will send an email to the address you provided. Follow the instructions in the email to confirm your account.
If you have an existing business, you can also sign up for a business account. On the sign up page, click the link at the top of the registration page that says "Start a Business Account." You will be prompted to enter your business name and some additional contact information.









4

Set up your payment method. Accepted payment methods vary by country. In the United States, sellers are required to accept PayPal or to have a merchant credit card account. Set up your PayPal account following the links from the eBay website, or visit www.PayPal.com.


Check eBay's accepted payments policies to find out what is allowed [4].









5

Build your reputation by buying a few small items. One important way that ebay maintains itself as a safe marketplace is by encouraging buyers and sellers to leave feedback about each other. Buyers look at sellers' feedback ratings, and buying a few items is the quickest way to add positive ratings to your profile.


Try buying small items that you want or need anyway, and pay immediately to get good feedback as a buyer. Don't worry about buying things you can resell. The main thing is to establish yourself as a reliable member of the ebay community.
Potential buyers who see a new seller without feedback can be very wary that you're a "fly-by-night" seller, and they may hesitate to buy from you.









6

Set up your profile page. It's not necessary to have a very elaborate profile if you are just selling small items, but adding a picture and some information can help reassure buyers that you are a legitimate seller.


For selling more expensive items, adding more information about yourself is more important, especially if you are a new seller.
People do read these to try to find out more about you, so it's a good place to explain your credentials, such as being a collector, a retailer, a person with knowledge of particular items, etc.










Part 2

Choosing What to Sell








1

Sell what you know. eBay started out catering to hobbyists and collectors, and continues to be a great place to show off your stuff. If you are good at finding bargains or rare items in a particular category, consider specializing in items that you know a lot about.









2

Know what you can't sell. Obviously, illegal and hazardous items like human body parts, drugs, live animals and illicit services are not allowed. Other items may be sold, but are restricted, such as those sold in the "adults only" category. Check eBay's policies on banned and restricted items[5] to avoid having your account suspended or even permanently banned.









3

Minimize risk by selling what you already have, or by starting small. eBay places selling limits on new sellers, typically five items per month. If you're not sure what to sell, it's risky to build up inventory without conducting a few sales first. Try listing a few small items to get a feel for what sells and the logistics involved.


You can start by selling things you have around the house that you are no longer using, or by picking a few items to experiment with that you can either return or keep for yourself.
It's important to experiment before loading up on too much inventory. You may not be able to sell your items at a high enough price to make a profit, or you could end up with a lot of extra inventory that's hard to move.
If you already have some inventory from your existing collections or business, you're ready to go! Making a few sales can help you figure out the best approach to selling your goods on eBay.









4

Consider how you will source your items. Often, what you sell is determined by what you can find. It can take time and effort to source things for eBay, so it's important to find a sourcing method that you enjoy and that you're comfortable with.


eBay itself can be a good place to find bargains. Some people look for items that are underpriced, badly presented or have misspelled titles.
If you enjoy thrift stores or garage sales, this is a great place to start. Just remember that you usually can't return what you buy, so you may end up with items that cannot sell.
Discount, warehouse and outlet stores are good places to find bargains, and often have a return policy you can take advantage of if your items don't sell.









5

Consider how long you will spend listing each item. Remember, you have to take pictures, write descriptions, and figure out how to ship every single item you sell. This takes time, so it's more efficient to sell similar items, and items that are easy to photograph and describe.


Try to find things in bulk, or with similar features. That way you can create listing templates for yourself, or even just create one listing for multiple items.
Look for items that are easy to describe, photograph, and ship.
Look for items that you can easily ship in the same manner, so that you can pack things quickly and get bulk discounts on shipping materials.









6

Consider shipping and storage logistics. Bulky and heavy items can be difficult to make a profit on, because they can be expensive to ship, and take up a lot of space.


Buyers look at the total cost of the item, including shipping, so the shipping cost always has to be factored in when considering if an item can be sold at a reasonable price.
Think about space as an important issue. Working from home selling things can reduce overheads but if your stock starts taking over the space, your life won't be the same. Do you have room for your products and room to wrap, pack and store purchased items?









7

Consider how quickly you can move your inventory, and how long you are willing to wait. Be aware that trends can pass quickly, leaving you with stale stock. For other items, you might have to wait longer for the collector or other interested buyer to turn up.









8

Know what's hot. Obviously, the more popular an item is, the more people will be searching and bidding for it. This requires a certain knack, and often successful sellers are people that intuitively know what will sell. However, eBay does have some tools for pinpointing what is popular.


Check out eBay's hot items page [6]. Items commonly listed here include brand name clothing, electronics, gold jewelry, fashion accessories and football shirts.
Look at completed listings. This allows you to see how many of a particular item has sold, when they were sold, and how much they sold for. If you have the eBay app on your mobile device, this can be particularly useful if you're at a store or garage sale and are unsure about whether to buy something.

Type your query into eBay's search box, then check the boxes next to "Sold listings" or "Completed listings" in the "Show only" section of the menu on the left of the page.
For the mobile app, enter your search words, then tap "Refine." Check "Completed listings" or "Sold items only" under "Search refinement options."


You can use products built specifically for seller research, but you'll need to pay for these. Popsike.com is a free version dedicated for music sellers.
Be aware that if something is popular, there will be many sellers selling the very same things as you. It can be difficult selling in a category that is already saturated because it's so easy to get lost in the sheer number of search results, and prices are already so cheap that it's nearly impossible to make a profit as a small seller. Also, your low feedback rating puts you at a disadvantage. Popular items attract scammers who prey on inexperienced sellers who do not know how to protect themselves.










Part 3

Creating Listings that Sell








1

Research your market. Search eBay for items like those you want to sell, and read the listings, especially completed listings which have sold for a good price, or current listings that have attracted a lot of bids.


Take note of what sort of information or photos you find most helpful to you as a potential buyer – the same type of information will be helpful to your potential buyers.
Consider what makes you think a seller is trustworthy and how you will manage to convey that same sense of trustworthiness through your sales and profile.









2

Log in and go to "Sell" either in "My eBay" or through the Main Page at the top.








3

Enter a title for your listing. The title is the front line in getting your auction noticed. A good title will not only give potential buyers enough information to know whether the listing is worth their time to look at, it will also attract people searching for your items.


Include all relevant words and spell them correctly. Insufficient information in a title will attract a far smaller number of potential buyers and/or bidders; consequently such an item will either not sell, or go for a much lower price than it would otherwise.
Keep the words relevant. Exclude fluff such as "cool" or "excellent". You have very little space, so use it for what people are searching for (nobody is going to be searching eBay for items titled "L@@K" or "AWESOME!!!!").
Include alternative spellings and phrasings if you have space. For example, if you're selling an iPod, put "MP3 player" in your title. However, eBay's search will automatically account for variant phrasings; it will also sometimes check category names in addition to the auction title. Do a search on specific terms and look at the titles of the auctions that come up.









4

Take good photographs of your item. Photographs which clearly illustrate the item to be sold can make a listing; bad photographs can actually repel customers. Get a cheap digital camera or a camera phone if you don't have one already. You are required to include at least one photograph with your listing, and having more than one photo definitely boosts buyers' confidence. You can have up to 12 photos per listing.


Use good lighting. Where possible, turn off your flash and use natural light. Go outside, or take a photo by a window.
Rotate or crop any photos that might need it for a better appearance, and use photo editing software or eBay's photo editor to improve the picture.
Get as many photographs as your buyers will need. Take photographs of your item from every angle that you think someone will find useful. eBay offers 12 free photos on each listing.
Get photographs of any unusual feature, any defects, and so on. The extra confidence that this will give buyers is almost always (except on the lowest-valued items) worthwhile. Of course, some items only need one photo; use your judgment here.
Don't use a distracting or dirty background and get rid of any nearby clutter. A simple sheet of white paper may be used to provide a clean, neutral background for smaller items.
Don't copy photographs from other listings or anywhere else on the Internet, ever. Apart from being dishonest and fraudulent, this will almost always be copyright infringement; nearly everything on the Internet, and elsewhere, is copyrighted, whether it has a copyright notice or not.
See how to take better product photos for free for more ideas on producing good photos for eBay sales.









5

Enter a description for your item. Include any and all relevant information. This includes things like the manufacturer, compatibility (for items intended to be used with something else), size, weight, color, condition, measurements, and so on.


Be careful when adding too much information. A buyer can skim through information they do not need to know, but will likely hit the "back" button if they don't see the information they want. Extra information can also help search engines find your listing.
Put the most important information at or very near the beginning of the listing.
Keep the design simple, if you see the need to design a listing at all. Some sellers clutter their listings with unrelated elements that that it makes the listing itself more difficult to read, and display improperly on mobile devices. Let the pictures and your text speak for themselves.
Choose moderately large, easy to read text fonts for your listing and don't overdo animation, clashing colors and other distractions. Remember some buyers have poor eyesight and prefer large print. Think of "large print books" as an example of text size.
Be clear about any defects in the item. Buyers will find this out anyway, so let them decide for themselves what is a significant problem and what is not. Clearly describing an item's flaws helps protect you from Significantly Not As Described (SNAD) claims. However, if your item has flaws, consider not selling it at all on eBay. You don't want to get a reputation for selling junk. On negative feedback can seriously hurt or even destroy a small seller.









6

Pick a selling format. You can choose whichever is convenient for you and best suited to your item


The online auction. Auctions last from 1-10 days, and can sometimes allow you to get a higher price for your item, because it encourages buyers to become competitive with each other, and enjoy the thrill of winning an item as much as the item itself.

This is good when you have something to sell that people frequently search for and seem inclined to fight over, such as a rare piece of sports memorabilia.
The auction format is also useful when you're uncertain as to what price you should sell at, and can help you determine the price for similar items in the future.


Buy It Now items are fixed-price items. They allow the buyer to buy something and have it shipped to them immediately, rather than having to wait for the auction to end.

This is great for items that people either buy routinely or on impulse, or for items where the supply already outstrips the demand, and where you want to offer a competitive price.
Items which people need immediately are unlikely to attract many bids in an auction.











7

Set your price according to how much you paid for the item, your time, eBay fees, and how much it costs to ship. Remember that once someone buys an item from you or the auction ends, it constitutes a binding agreement to sell, and it is difficult to get past this unless both parties agree to cancel the sale. See how to determine what to price your eBay items for more details.


You can change the price at any time with fixed-price items, or before the first bid is placed for auction items.
Lower starting bids attract more bidders and interest in your item, and may well result in your item selling for more, but if an item doesn't generate enough interest or isn't visible enough, you may get a very low final selling price.
There is an option to set a "reserve" price for your item while offering a low starting bid, but eBay charges extra for this and some buyers find it annoying.
Don't overcharge for shipping and handling. While it's sometimes helpful to tweak the shipping price a bit to be able to offer a lower price, and account for handling and supplies, most buyers will be put off by obviously inflated shipping charges. These days, buyers expect free shipping, and eBay boosts items' visibility in the search if they offer free shipping. Unless your item is particularly heavy, increase your opening bid or Buy-It-Now price and offer free shipping.
Keep an eye on the invoices that eBay sends you and be a timely payer. You will owe commission fees and other fees over time from listing and you need to make regular, full payments in order to be able to continue listing your items for sale. While the fees might initially surprise you, treat them as very much a part of your business expenses and soon you'll remember that these need to come off the costs of your products and efforts.









8

Choose when to start and end your auction. Auctions end 1, 3, 5, 7 or 10 days after you start them. When the auction ends and how long it lasts can make a difference in how much your item sells for. By scheduling your auction to end at a peak buying time, you can often get a higher selling price.


Auctions ending on weekends tend to catch high traffic, therefore increasing the chances of better end prices for your items.[7]

Many items are also seasonal, and so there are better times of the year to be selling these than other times of the year. For example, beach gear does better in summer while skis will do better in winter.
You can check out eBay's planned promotions for certain categories [pages.ebay.com/sell/resources.html here]. Check this out and plan your sales for when these categories will be highlighted.









9

Keep a friendly tone. Many sellers seem to go to extra efforts to intimidate potential customers; they seem to think it's essential to leave scream threats (invariably in huge, colored fonts) to report non-paying bidders, and so on. Don't do this! You wouldn't want to buy from a brick-and-mortar store wherein the owner watched you every move, nor would you want to shop at a store wherein the sales clerk complained about other customers. The Internet is no different; it's insulting to your potential buyers to treat them as potential thieves or wrongdoers; drop the bad faith approach.


If you must include additional information on your policies, ensure the length is shorter than your item description.
Consider offering a return policy. Not only does this help you to qualify for discounts on eBay, some sellers believe it makes buyers more likely to commit to buy. Very few buyers actually return their purchases, so you are likely to profit more from letting buyers feel secure than to lose money from returns. On the other hand, the discounts eBay gives to Top Rated Plus sellers who offer discounts is small enough that a single return can cost more than the monthly discount for small sellers. If you offer a return policy, all buyers are allowed to return everything they buy from you for any reason; you can never refuse a return, even for buyer's remorse. If you officially don't offer returns, you can still take them on a case-by-case basis.
Answer questions from your buyers as the auction runs its course. Be prompt about it, and always be patient, clear, professional and friendly. Buyers don't like to see unanswered questions and it impacts your professionalism, so don't hesitate to respond.









10

Double-check everything before saving. Be sure that when you're done with everything at the end (you're at the "overview" page) to double check and press "Submit." If you don't press submit it won't be entered. You'll then get an e-mail confirming that your product was placed on eBay.


Check your spelling. This won't make up for a bad listing in other respects, but it still goes some way. Proper capitalization and punctuation makes listings much easier to read.
Fix any mistakes. You can continue to fix mistakes in an auction until the first bid has been placed, after which, it is what it says!










Part 4

Completing the Transaction








1

Watch the auction. You'll get an idea of interest by watching the counter change and if few people are looking, you might need to make adjustments to the auction to make it more appealing to those browsing about the site. Learn by observing what works and does not work, and apply changes as needed.

]

End an auction if needed. You have the ability to end an auction up to 12 hours before it's due to end. This should be used very sparingly though, as watchers may well have been excited about making bids and will be disappointed to see this as habitual. Keep it for exceptional circumstances such as broken, lost or stolen items. Once you have listed products for sale, keep them in a safe place.
Lower the reserve price. Prior to the last 12 hours of an auction, it's possible to lower the reserve price if you find that you're not getting bids.
Keep an eye on buyers. It is possible to block some buyers for certain reasons such as buyers who don't have PayPal, buyers who are in countries you don't ship to and buyers with two or more unpaid item strikes. And you can also set up Approved Buyers lists that automatically allow some buyers to bid.









2

When the item sells and has been paid for, be ready to ship promptly.








3

Package your items neatly and securely. If items are fragile, improper packaging can result in broken items and unhappy customers! Conversely, excellent packaging can really improve a buyer's impression of the sale









4

It's a good business practice to leave positive feedback for fast-paying customers. You can also use it as a promotional opportunity by saying something like "Thanks for shopping at My eBay Store! Please come back soon!"










Part 5

Promoting Your Listings








1

If you're selling original art or handmade goods of any kind, participate in eBay groups for your product. Collectors join these groups as often as artists/crafters and many artists/crafters are also buyers. Some hobbyists sell in order to fund their purchases. Read threads, be pleasant and friendly, don't engage in flame wars and compliment anything you like. It's a good way to make friends and get involved in a thriving niche community.









2

Use the power of social networking to promote your listings. Blog about your listings, for example, especially if you're an artist or crafter. Share them on Facebook and Twitter.









3

Include the shipping price in the total price or minimum bid. People will look at things that have cheap or free shipping, which in turn may make them more inclined to buy.









4

Sell inexpensive items to build up your feedback. Your feedback score is an oft-overlooked component of buying and selling on eBay. Buyers deciding between identical or near identical listings will usually opt for the one whose seller has a higher feedback rating. Boosting your feedback rating, as a result, is very important.









5

After you have become an established seller, consider opening a store or shop on eBay. This may be attractive if you want people to be able to search via your own distinct URL on search engines, you want to group sales items together under unique categories of your own making and if you want to build a really interesting profile for your regular and other buyers.









6

Finished.









Part 6

Tips from Experienced Sellers




1


Do not sell anything on eBay that you cannot afford to lose.
Describe your item as if there were no pictures, and photograph your item as if there was no description.
Read a book on selling before you get started.

eBay is not a get-rich quick scheme. At best, eBay is a get-rich-slow scheme. Unfortunately, many new sellers get scammed and find it's a get-poor-quick scheme.
Do not open an eBay account to sell your iPhone or designer handbag. Professional scammers are looking for new sellers offering popular items, and they will take both your item and your money. It's best to sell items like this though craigslist, letgo or another app that facilitates face-to-face cash transactions.

If the return policy is marked as "Returns Accepted", the buyer can return it. Just let the seller know that you're not satisfied with it, and he/she will work it out for you to make sure you're happy with what you get. However, it's likely that you will have to pay for shipping to send the item back.

How does eBay collect their money and how much are we paying for this service?



								
								wikiHow Contributor							

You normally get up to 50 free listings per month and pay 30 cents per listing for any additional ones, unless you want to add some upgrades to your listing. You also pay a final value fee for each item that successfully sells, which is usually 10% of the total price including shipping. All fees for the previous month are automatically withdrawn from your linked PayPal account (and thereby, your bank account) around the middle of the next month. See http://pages.ebay.com/help/sell/fees.html for more details on fees.

What do I do if I changed my mind about a sale?



Vieno 

It depends on what stage your listing is in. If it is a Buy-It-Now listing that has not sold, or an auction that has received no bids, you can cancel. If the auction has received a bid but is still open, you can cancel the bids and end the auction, but eBay will charge you a final value fee for the bid you received. If the listing has ended with a buyer, and the buyer has paid, you can get your account banned in short order for refusal to ship. Cancelling a sale after you have received payment will in most cases earn you a defect which can lower your selling status. Read eBay's documentation about cancelling sales for full details.

Do I have to accept a low bid?



Vieno 

Yes. An auction is a binding legal contract. If for example, you list a $500 Gucci handbag for a starting bid of 99¢ with no reserve, and the highest bid is 99¢, you have to ship that Gucci bag when the buyer pays you 99¢. So don't do that. Start the auction for the lowest price you will accept for the item. Do not count on the bids increasing to your desired price. Canceling sales because you didn't get the price you wanted is infuriating to buyers, and eBay has a very low tolerance for this practice.

Thanks!

What if the items I'm selling are antique China, what should I look out and be prepared for?



Vieno 

Think very carefully before you sell these items on any site that requires you to ship them. Packaging them so that not a single piece is broken during shipment requires skill, experience, and the right packing material, which can be expensive in and of itself. Fragile items are usually heavy, making shipping expensive. I would highly recommend that you try selling these items locally using a site like craigslist or letgo instead of eBay.

Thanks!

Tips


Whether you're a novice seller or someone who has been selling for a while, is to realize that there isn't any single secret to sales success. The reality is that you need to try out the selling your own way until you find the way that produces the most success for you, your items and your approach. Rely on your common sense, good observation and research skills as well as being an excellent communicator and you'll be able to make a success of selling on eBay.
Take advantage of free sales training. There are dozens of books on how to sell on eBay. You'll find at least one at your local public library and it should be sufficient (as they all tend to say the same thing after a while and purchasing one isn't really worth it).





Warnings


Be careful of selling overseas. Most items are perfectly fine, and can increase your bidding pool. However, what may be perfectly legal in the US may be illegal in other countries (or vice versa).
Do not sell illegal items. Doing so can bring heavy consequences upon you.
A sale on eBay is as final as a contract anywhere else. If you commit to selling something at auction on eBay, then you can't change your mind because it didn't reach a price high enough. It is entirely possible to lose money on an item if you put a starting price that is too low for you to at least break even if only one person bids on it.
Don't accept offers to sell an item or accept payments outside of ebay. This is against ebay policies and gives you no recourse if the sale goes badly.

CEOs want a practical product that will help make their job easier, the company they work for, and a good way to increase profit, and to reduce the number of loss by using it. Many times you have to go to other people to sell a product to a business, so the CEO may not be the best choice. If your product is good, then the chances is a CEO or their affliates may come to you to buy it. It comes down to these steps:1. Broadcast your advantage.2. Fit into your customer's routine.3. Work right out of the box4. Make benefits easy to spot.5. Let customers try it out6. Attract the Right Audience7. Properly Manage Expectations8. Remove Barriers to Buy the product9. Drive Engagement & Investment10. Make it Easy to Buy11. Prove That It Works12. Personalize It  13. Provide the Necessary Support14. Show why you are better than Competitors15. Sponsor an Event to Market the Product16. Pull a PR Stunt17. Share the Load with Affiliate Marketing18. Build the Right Relationships19. Use various resources to market the product, such as social media, websites, publications, advertizing, etc.20. Hire the right Sales Team to Sale the Product for you. Use a commission based pay scale, as it is based on performance, and it cost you less if they are in effective, but it gives the good sales people the incentive to work harder, to sale the product. 21. Any other people to required to run the business, such as web designers, PR, customer support, etc. Make sure you pay a marketable rate, to get a good quality in employees. Low pay will decrease the chances of getting skilled employees, and how much there is a turn over within the company. How long, and how much you will need, is a matte of the size of the company.Sources:How to Sell a Product: 5 Ways to Sell ItselfSaaS Marketing Plan: 5 Ways to Get your App to Sell ItselfHow to Market a Brand New Producthttps://blog.kissmetrics.com/you...370 Views · 1 UpvotePromoted by HeapHeap is like Google Analytics, but it's made for SaaS apps.Heap automatically tracks every action (e.g. click, swipe, pageview) users take in your web app.Learn More at heapanalytics.comRelated QuestionsMore Answers BelowI manage a young startup company in the valley.

10 Best-Selling Products of All Time | Time.comSearchSearchSign InmoviesDunkirk Actor Says Christopher Nolan Banned Chairs and Water Bottles from SetcelebritiesSee Justin Theroux and Jason Bateman Flaunt Their Budding Summer BromanceCOMPARECARDSSPONSOREDpoliticsSenate Voted Against Health Care Repeal on Anniversary of Approving MedicareSpencer Platt—Getty ImagesConsumer ElectronicsThese Are the 10 Best-Selling Products of All TimeVince Calio,Thomas C. Frohlich,Alexander E.M. HessMay 08, 2014This post is in partnership with 24/7 Wall Street. The article below was originally published on 247wallst.com.Creating the most popular product of the year will make consumers and investors happy. But making an all-time bestseller can transform an industry and define a business for decades.Many of the best-selling products were first in a new category. Apple, which has sold more than 500 million iPhones, was the first to introduce a touchscreen smartphone that could seamlessly handle music, web browsing and phone calls. Other bestsellers took a niche market and made it mainstream. Before Star Wars, film was either comedy, romance or drama. The Harry Potter book series was so successful that The New York Times Book Review created a separate children’s bestseller list in 2000 to account for the series’ popularity.MORE: 10 Companies Paying Americans the LeastIn some cases, top-selling products were a simply better than their competitors. Before the Sony PlayStation, video game consoles were largely cartridge-based. With the advent of the PlayStation, which relied on the new CD-ROM format, game files could be large enough to support 3D gameplay and full-motion video. Lipitor, which has become the world’s best-selling drug with $141 billion in sales, was far more effective than previously-released drugs at lowering bad cholesterol.RelatedAsusThis Company Just Copied the Apple Watch’s Best FeatureAsusThis Company Just Copied the Apple Watch’s Best FeatureA number of these products continue to be dominate their markets. The iPad remains the world’s best-selling tablet, with a 32.5% market share last quarter, despite challenges from Amazon.com’s Kindle Fire and Samsung’s Galaxy tablet lines. The PlayStation 4 has sold over 7 million units since it launched last year, well above the Microsoft Xbox One.Despite their success, some of these products face challenges. Sales of Pfizer’s Lipitor dropped each year after its maker, Pfizer, lost patent protection on the drug in 2011 and cheaper generic drugs came on the market. The ongoing Star Wars saga may lose its status as the all time best-selling movie franchise to Walt Disney’s Marvel Franchise. The Avengers broke box office records, grossing $203.4 million on its opening weekend.MORE: The Most Polluted Cities in AmericaTo determine the best-selling products of all-time, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed categories of products widely purchased by consumers and identified individual products that had the highest sales in their category.In some cases, we gathered figures from multiple sources and estimated the final sales figure. In other instances, where one company had a clear market lead, figures reflect data from previous years.These are the best-selling products of all time.1. PlayStation> Category: Video game console> Total sales: 344 million units> Parent company: SonyWhen Sony released the PlayStation in the United States in 1995, its 32-bit processor was the most powerful available on the console market at the time. Sony sold more than 70 million PlayStations worldwide by the time the PlayStation 2 was released in 2000. The PlayStation 2 also sold very well in the U.S. and abroad. Sony released the PlayStation 3 in 2006, and it sold 80 million units to retailers by November 2013. The latest generation, the PlayStation 4, has been wildly successful thus-far, already selling 7 million units as of April.2. Lipitor> Category: Pharmaceutical> Total sales: $141 billion> Parent company: PfizerPfizer’s Lipitor is prescribed to lower LDL (or bad) cholesterol — high levels of bad cholesterol increase the risk of heart disease. Lipitor is classified as a statin, a class of drug used to reduce the risk of heart-related ailments. However, Lipitor sales have plummeted in recent years after its U.S. patent expired in 2011. Lipitor has lost patent protection in other major markets since. In 2013, Lipitor sales totaled $2.3 billion, down from $9.6 billion in 2011 according to Pfizer’s 2013 annual report. Still, since its introduction in 1997, no other drug came close to Lipitor’s commercial success. The closest competitor for all time sales is Plavix, which had slightly more than half of Lipitor’s lifetime revenue, according to Forbes.MORE: America's Most Miserable Cities3. Corolla> Category: Vehicle> Total sales: 40.7 million units> Parent company: Toyota (NYSE: TM)Toyota announced last month it sold 1.2 million Corollas in 2013, a 5% year-over-year increase. Since its introduction in Japan in 1966 — the car became available in the U.S. in 1968 — Toyota has sold more than 40.7 million Corollas, more than any other car model. The Corolla’s success on the  market is likely due to its reliability, relatively low gas mileage, and affordability. The newly redesigned 2014 Corolla is the model’s 11th generation, and it claims to have better gas mileage and a slightly larger interior. Brand new, the Corolla’s starting MSRP is $16,800.4. Star Wars> Category: Movies> Total sales: $4.6 billion> Parent company: 20th Century FoxOnly “Gone with the Wind” brought in more money than the original Star Wars movie. Combined, however, the original trilogy grossed $2.4 billion, accounting for inflation. When Star Wars: Episode I was released more than 20 years later, it grossed $675 million, considerably more than the later installments — episodes two and three — which each still grossed more than $400 million. In total, the Star Wars movies, including special editions and re-releases, grossed $4.6 billion adjusted for inflation in the U.S. While 20th Century Fox still owns the rights to the original Star Wars, Disney purchased the Star Wars universe — Lucasfilms — for $4 billion in 2012. Disney will release the final three movies under J.J. Abrams’ direction. The first of the three is scheduled to hit the box office in 2015.5. iPad> Category: Tablet> Total sales: 211 million units> Parent company: AppleDespite losing market share in the first quarter, Apple’s iPad is still the best-selling tablet. The iPad held 40% of the tablet market in the first quarter of 2013, but only 32.5% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC. Close rival Samsung picked up much of that market share. IDC analyst reported that iPad lost some of its market share because consumers are holding onto their tablets for longer rather than immediately purchasing the newest version. Apple sold 16.4 million units in the second quarter alone, and more than 211 million since the iPad was first introduced in 2010.Visit 24/7 Wall St. to see the remaining best-selling products of all time.More from 24/7 Wall St.The Happiest Countries in the WorldAmerica's Most Common JobsCustomer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.
