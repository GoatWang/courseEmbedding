Investing with Clarity and Conviction for Over Four Decades



In the investment world, as in life, change often unlocks hidden potential. Yet most investors sit on the sidelines while a transformation is underway, waiting to see evidence of positive results.

Cramer Rosenthal McGlynn, LLC is a firm that strives to recognize potential and seize opportunity. As of the most recent quarter-end, we manage approximately $7 billion for institutions and individuals and we have followed a proven investment philosophy since 1973. Our strategies are offered as separate accounts, mutual funds, UCITS, and private funds.

Building Investment Conviction


CRM generates ideas from both qualitative (approximately 75%) and quantitative (approximately 25%) sources. Qualitative ideas emanate from company presentations, news services, due diligence on existing holdings, our internal research database, leveraging investment themes, and rich text screening for specific change expressions such as acquisition, restructuring, etc. The quantitative sources include screening for stocks that have underperformed the market or peer companies over certain time periods, screening for companies that are fundamentally underperforming peers as expressed by operating margins that are below their own history or peers, and ranking stocks by sell side or buy side sentiment. Ideas that are being actively researched are what we call “work in process.” These names are reviewed regularly by portfolio managers, and stocks are added or deleted in order to focus the team’s research efforts. Part of processing an idea includes preparing an “Investment Case,” which documents the investment thesis. It consists of a brief company description, a discussion of the change(s), and assessment of the relative neglect and valuation. The Investment Case also includes an assessment of the risks relevant to the thesis and our determination of a fair price target at that point in time.

Buy Discipline
Our investment process is very team oriented and collaborative. There are typically multiple analysts/portfolio managers engaged in a review and discussion of new ideas and Investment Cases. A financial model in sufficient detail and relevant due diligence is also prepared and reviewed as part of the evaluation process. If the risk/reward ratio is deemed attractive by the portfolio managers in the context of their overall portfolio construction, a decision will be made by the portfolio managers to initiate a position in the stock. The portfolio managers will modulate the position size depending upon the relative attractiveness of the idea, the expected return, and other risk considerations.
Sell Discipline
CRM’s process is focused not only on building the Investment Case, but also on understanding how the case might deteriorate. The Firm’s sell discipline is ultimately dependent upon the written Investment Case for the stock. A position will generally be sold when one or more of the following occurs: an established price target is approaching or is attained, implying the stock has reached our estimation of fair valuation; a factor in our initial investment thesis has deteriorated causing us to reassess the potential for the company; or we identify a more promising investment opportunity. After a decision to sell is made, the investment is replaced by either a new idea or existing holdings that offer a greater risk/reward profile.

Summary

The CRM Small/Mid Cap Value strategy originated with the founding of the firm in 1973. This strategy is offered as a separate account and mutual fund.
The CRM Small/Mid Cap Value strategy is designed for investors to capture investment returns in a concentrated market capitalization range of stocks, from approximately $500 million to $6 billion. The investment philosophy and process is identical across strategies.
Supported by an experienced team of investment professionals, the portfolio managers make judgments about the relative attractiveness of various securities in selecting stocks for the portfolio.

Although the portfolio is built from the bottom up, stock-specific risks, sector weightings and risk/reward characteristics are all considered during the portfolio construction process.

If you don't know Jim Cramer as one of America's most respected investment pros and media personalities, you know him because he's one of the most successful hedge fund managers in Wall Street history. Not only has Cramer's educational finance show Mad Money been on CNBC for over a decade, he's also spent 14 years managing money for some of the wealthiest families in the world through the hedge fund he founded, Cramer Berkowitz: a fund that generated an annual average return of 24%!

	Jim's current portfolio, Action Alerts PLUS, 
	goes toe-to-toe with major stock indices like the S&P; 500 every trading day. How? Jim and his team analyze the business behind each stock, and understand the fundamentals of each business, allowing them to successfully navigate the market for decades. And now, Jim is offering subscriber access to his entire portfolio so you can make trades before he does. The offerings of his service are hard for any level investor to pass up because Jim Cramer and his team at Action Alerts PLUS, teach you how to successfully invest in the market.

	Here's how Action Alerts PLUS works: when you signup, Jim Cramer and TheStreet research team will grant you complete unfettered access to Cramer's stock portfolio, and send you email alerts before Cramer makes each trades so you can invest alongside of him. It's like—well, it is—getting a skilled money manager's insight, while still maintaining the control to invest as you please. You'll also receive the analysis behind each of his trading decisions, snapshots of important events that are taking place in the market, plus valuable bonus reports to help you get started investing the way Jim Cramer does: 
	Jim Cramer's Ten Commandments of Trading, Cramer's 25 Rules for Investors, and 7 Mistakes Every Investor Must Avoid. Not to mention, Cramer is offering a free, no obligation, 14-day trial for Topdust readers through this link.

	But perhaps the most awe-inspiring of the offering is that you get immediate access to Jim's multi-million dollar portfolio, even with your free trial subscription. Last week, I signed up for my free trial to Action Alerts PLUS, and right away, I could see all the stocks Jim has ever bought/sold for the portfolio as well as the buy prices and current prices. During just the first 7 days of a 14-day trial, I received two trade alerts before Jim Cramer bought so a subscriber could buy them when he did. Both stocks were already up over 3% in just the first few days!

	Because Jim's sound investment strategy has proven to be effective, and because of the invaluable education offered by the subscription, we're calling Action Alerts PLUS a must-buy product for investors of every skill-level whether you want to invest, learn, or just sneak a peek at Jim's portfolio.

Update: Jim Cramer is extending a special offer to our readers! Follow this link to get your FREE, no obligation 14-day trial to Action Alerts Plus and get instant access to Cramer's entire portfolio! (He'll also send you a copy of his bestselling book: "Get Rich Carefully" free with no strings attached!)

Our Firm





 Clarity. Consistency. Conviction. 

Investing with Clarity and Conviction for Over Four Decades



In the investment world, as in life, change often unlocks hidden potential. Yet most investors sit on the sidelines while a transformation is underway, waiting to see evidence of positive results. This wait-and-see attitude is fertile ground for an investment manager structured to capitalize on change through intensive research. Cramer Rosenthal McGlynn, LLC is a firm that strives to recognize potential and seize opportunity. As of the most recent quarter-end, we manage approximately $7 billion for institutions and individuals and we have followed a proven investment philosophy since 1973. Our strategies are offered as separate accounts, mutual funds, UCITS, and private funds.

Competitive advantageEquity investing is our sole focus. As a firm, we have invested according to the same philosophy for over 40 years while carefully managing asset growth.
More about our philosophy
Unique, relatively concentrated portfolioActive share across our strategies has consistently been high — with most of our strategies demonstrating above 90% since the inception of the products1.
