History[edit]
Charles Ragus founded AdvoCare in 1993 as a multi-level marketing (MLM) company that distributes dietary supplement products.[7][8] The name AdvoCare is short for "Advocates Who Care".[9] Before founding AdvoCare, Ragus worked as a regional vice president for Fidelity Union Insurance, and as a multi-level marketing (MLM) distributor for Herbalife. He had initially founded the MLM company Omnitrition International in 1989. Ragus briefly played defensive end for the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs in the 1960s.[9][10][11] He died in 2001 at the age 58.[12][13]
In May 2007, Richard H. Wright became president and CEO of AdvoCare. Wright had previously served as Chief of Staff for US Representative Jim McCrery.[7][14]
Products[edit]
AdvoCare sells several lines of dietary supplements under the brand names Trim, Active, Well, Performance Elite, Fit, and 24 Day Challenge.[15]
Business[edit]
AdvoCare is a multilevel marketing company.[3][4][5] In addition to revenue from product sales, AdvoCare distributors can potentially earn additional commissions from sales by their 'downline' distributors. According to the company's 2013 Income disclosure statement, the average annual income, not including expenses, for AdvoCare distributors who were 'active' in 2013 (defined as earning a payment during the year) was $1,704.08.[16]
In a 2010 court case Advocare said that it had around 60,000 active distributors, and had sold approximately 350,000 distributorships since 2003.[6]
AdvoCare is a member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association (DSA), and participated in the 2010 DSA Code of Ethics Communication Initiative.[17] AdvoCare President Richard Wright served on the DSA Board of Directors in 2011.[18]
Sponsorships and Endorsements[edit]




Trevor Bayne's AdvoCare-branded Ford Mustang in NASCAR competition.


Among AdvoCare's contracted celebrity endorsers are NFL quarterbacks Andy Dalton, Philip Rivers and Alex Smith; Major League Baseball pitcher Doug Fister; CrossFit champion Rich Froning; and, previously, Carli Lloyd, Sam Bradford, and Wes Welker.[9] However, their most important spokesman is New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees.[9] Celebrity endorsers are said to be central to "the Bulletproof Shield," a key sales and recruitment technique used by the company: distributors place themselves at the center of a chart illustrating the company's endorsements and members of its scientific and medical advisory board, and deflects questions about the company by replying, "Well, I don't know about (X), but what I do know is" that particular athletes or doctors have endorsed AdvoCare.[9]
From 2009 until 2013, AdvoCare was the title sponsor of the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana. The 2013 game was known as the AdvoCare V100 Bowl.[19][20][21] In 2012, AdvoCare partnered with the Major League Soccer team FC Dallas and became its jersey sponsor.[22]
In 2014, AdvoCare secured the naming rights of a professional sports practice facility located at The Greenbrier in West Virginia.[23] The facility was named the AdvoCare Sports Performance Center and hosted the 2014 training camp for the New Orleans Saints.[24][25][26] AdvoCare also became the title sponsor of the 2014 Texas Bowl.[27] In 2016, AdvoCare will be sponsoring the Texas Kickoff and Cowboys Classic games.[28][29]
Since 2011,[30][31] AdvoCare has sponsored several NASCAR racing teams, as well as races at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway.[30][31] The company has sponsored driver Trevor Bayne and Roush Fenway Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and Xfinity Series since 2014.[9][32]
Controversy[edit]
In July 2008, Olympic swimmer Jessica Hardy tested positive for the banned breathing enhancer, clenbuterol. Hardy said she had never heard of the substance, attributing the positive result to either a tainted supplement or sabotage.[33][34] At the time, Hardy had been taking the supplement Arginine Extreme, which she had received for free from AdvoCare in exchange for making product testimonials,[35][36] and she claimed in a subsequent lawsuit that the company's product was tainted.[37] AdvoCare sued Hardy for making false claims.[38] An arbitration hearing reduced Hardy's suspension after a scientific expert testified that the AdvoCare product was tainted. AdvoCare disputed the panel's findings, saying that two independent laboratories had not found any evidence of Clenbuterol in the supplements.[39]
In 2009, a Dallas County jury awarded $1.9 million in damages against AdvoCare after finding that the company had engaged in deceptive trade practices and unfairly canceled agreements with two of its distributors.[40] According to the lawsuit, litigants Bruce and Teresa Badgett of Arlington, Texas, had been active and profitable marketers of AdvoCare products for more than a dozen years before their distributorship was canceled by the company in 2006 "based upon vague and trumped-up charges." The jury found that AdvoCare engaged in false, misleading or deceptive practices that damaged the Badgetts and that the termination provisions of the distributor contract with AdvoCare were unconscionable, according to court documents. AdvoCare disputed the ruling[40] and on April 30, 2010, filed to appeal the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs were not customers and therefore did not fit the statutory definition necessary to be covered under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[41] The appeal was dismissed on March 13, 2012 and the company was ordered to reimburse the Badgett's for court costs related to their defense in the appeal case.[42]
AdvoCare ceased offering KickStart Spark, targeted to youth age 4-11, after pediatricians had expressed concerns about the product containing 60 mg of caffeine.[43] AdvoCare was also the subject of criticism for its marketing at youth athletic events. In 2005, the company paid $5,000 to sponsor a high school wrestling tournament in Sacramento but after negative publicity, AdvoCare officials said they would not sponsor any more school events.[43]
Wendy Miller of the Beaumont Weight Control Center said AdvoCare's Herbal Cleanse is probably safe for many users, but she suggested that the same results could be achieved without the products.[44]
In March 2016, Advocare was the subject of a critical exposée in ESPN The Magazine. The exposée argues that the company and a small number of distributors at the top of a distribution network makes most of its money from the signing-up of new distributors rather than sales of the product, while exaggerating the likelihood of financial success of distributors when only a few make a significant amount of money; that the company creates a cult-like atmosphere of not questioning the company's claims or the probability of financial success in new distributors, to the point where distributors will shun friends and family members who do so; and that the company is internally riven by divisions over the company's strong use of religious affiliation as part of its business model, with more devout members of the organization using it to gain and hold power in the organization and over its members.[9]

History[edit]
Charles Ragus founded AdvoCare in 1993 as a multi-level marketing (MLM) company that distributes dietary supplement products.[7][8] The name AdvoCare is short for "Advocates Who Care".[9] Before founding AdvoCare, Ragus worked as a regional vice president for Fidelity Union Insurance, and as a multi-level marketing (MLM) distributor for Herbalife. He had initially founded the MLM company Omnitrition International in 1989. Ragus briefly played defensive end for the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs in the 1960s.[9][10][11] He died in 2001 at the age 58.[12][13]
In May 2007, Richard H. Wright became president and CEO of AdvoCare. Wright had previously served as Chief of Staff for US Representative Jim McCrery.[7][14]
Products[edit]
AdvoCare sells several lines of dietary supplements under the brand names Trim, Active, Well, Performance Elite, Fit, and 24 Day Challenge.[15]
Business[edit]
AdvoCare is a multilevel marketing company.[3][4][5] In addition to revenue from product sales, AdvoCare distributors can potentially earn additional commissions from sales by their 'downline' distributors. According to the company's 2013 Income disclosure statement, the average annual income, not including expenses, for AdvoCare distributors who were 'active' in 2013 (defined as earning a payment during the year) was $1,704.08.[16]
In a 2010 court case Advocare said that it had around 60,000 active distributors, and had sold approximately 350,000 distributorships since 2003.[6]
AdvoCare is a member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association (DSA), and participated in the 2010 DSA Code of Ethics Communication Initiative.[17] AdvoCare President Richard Wright served on the DSA Board of Directors in 2011.[18]
Sponsorships and Endorsements[edit]




Trevor Bayne's AdvoCare-branded Ford Mustang in NASCAR competition.


Among AdvoCare's contracted celebrity endorsers are NFL quarterbacks Andy Dalton, Philip Rivers and Alex Smith; Major League Baseball pitcher Doug Fister; CrossFit champion Rich Froning; and, previously, Carli Lloyd, Sam Bradford, and Wes Welker.[9] However, their most important spokesman is New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees.[9] Celebrity endorsers are said to be central to "the Bulletproof Shield," a key sales and recruitment technique used by the company: distributors place themselves at the center of a chart illustrating the company's endorsements and members of its scientific and medical advisory board, and deflects questions about the company by replying, "Well, I don't know about (X), but what I do know is" that particular athletes or doctors have endorsed AdvoCare.[9]
From 2009 until 2013, AdvoCare was the title sponsor of the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana. The 2013 game was known as the AdvoCare V100 Bowl.[19][20][21] In 2012, AdvoCare partnered with the Major League Soccer team FC Dallas and became its jersey sponsor.[22]
In 2014, AdvoCare secured the naming rights of a professional sports practice facility located at The Greenbrier in West Virginia.[23] The facility was named the AdvoCare Sports Performance Center and hosted the 2014 training camp for the New Orleans Saints.[24][25][26] AdvoCare also became the title sponsor of the 2014 Texas Bowl.[27] In 2016, AdvoCare will be sponsoring the Texas Kickoff and Cowboys Classic games.[28][29]
Since 2011,[30][31] AdvoCare has sponsored several NASCAR racing teams, as well as races at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway.[30][31] The company has sponsored driver Trevor Bayne and Roush Fenway Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and Xfinity Series since 2014.[9][32]
Controversy[edit]
In July 2008, Olympic swimmer Jessica Hardy tested positive for the banned breathing enhancer, clenbuterol. Hardy said she had never heard of the substance, attributing the positive result to either a tainted supplement or sabotage.[33][34] At the time, Hardy had been taking the supplement Arginine Extreme, which she had received for free from AdvoCare in exchange for making product testimonials,[35][36] and she claimed in a subsequent lawsuit that the company's product was tainted.[37] AdvoCare sued Hardy for making false claims.[38] An arbitration hearing reduced Hardy's suspension after a scientific expert testified that the AdvoCare product was tainted. AdvoCare disputed the panel's findings, saying that two independent laboratories had not found any evidence of Clenbuterol in the supplements.[39]
In 2009, a Dallas County jury awarded $1.9 million in damages against AdvoCare after finding that the company had engaged in deceptive trade practices and unfairly canceled agreements with two of its distributors.[40] According to the lawsuit, litigants Bruce and Teresa Badgett of Arlington, Texas, had been active and profitable marketers of AdvoCare products for more than a dozen years before their distributorship was canceled by the company in 2006 "based upon vague and trumped-up charges." The jury found that AdvoCare engaged in false, misleading or deceptive practices that damaged the Badgetts and that the termination provisions of the distributor contract with AdvoCare were unconscionable, according to court documents. AdvoCare disputed the ruling[40] and on April 30, 2010, filed to appeal the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs were not customers and therefore did not fit the statutory definition necessary to be covered under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[41] The appeal was dismissed on March 13, 2012 and the company was ordered to reimburse the Badgett's for court costs related to their defense in the appeal case.[42]
AdvoCare ceased offering KickStart Spark, targeted to youth age 4-11, after pediatricians had expressed concerns about the product containing 60 mg of caffeine.[43] AdvoCare was also the subject of criticism for its marketing at youth athletic events. In 2005, the company paid $5,000 to sponsor a high school wrestling tournament in Sacramento but after negative publicity, AdvoCare officials said they would not sponsor any more school events.[43]
Wendy Miller of the Beaumont Weight Control Center said AdvoCare's Herbal Cleanse is probably safe for many users, but she suggested that the same results could be achieved without the products.[44]
In March 2016, Advocare was the subject of a critical exposée in ESPN The Magazine. The exposée argues that the company and a small number of distributors at the top of a distribution network makes most of its money from the signing-up of new distributors rather than sales of the product, while exaggerating the likelihood of financial success of distributors when only a few make a significant amount of money; that the company creates a cult-like atmosphere of not questioning the company's claims or the probability of financial success in new distributors, to the point where distributors will shun friends and family members who do so; and that the company is internally riven by divisions over the company's strong use of religious affiliation as part of its business model, with more devout members of the organization using it to gain and hold power in the organization and over its members.[9]

History[edit]
Charles Ragus founded AdvoCare in 1993 as a multi-level marketing (MLM) company that distributes dietary supplement products.[7][8] The name AdvoCare is short for "Advocates Who Care".[9] Before founding AdvoCare, Ragus worked as a regional vice president for Fidelity Union Insurance, and as a multi-level marketing (MLM) distributor for Herbalife. He had initially founded the MLM company Omnitrition International in 1989. Ragus briefly played defensive end for the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs in the 1960s.[9][10][11] He died in 2001 at the age 58.[12][13]
In May 2007, Richard H. Wright became president and CEO of AdvoCare. Wright had previously served as Chief of Staff for US Representative Jim McCrery.[7][14]
Products[edit]
AdvoCare sells several lines of dietary supplements under the brand names Trim, Active, Well, Performance Elite, Fit, and 24 Day Challenge.[15]
Business[edit]
AdvoCare is a multilevel marketing company.[3][4][5] In addition to revenue from product sales, AdvoCare distributors can potentially earn additional commissions from sales by their 'downline' distributors. According to the company's 2013 Income disclosure statement, the average annual income, not including expenses, for AdvoCare distributors who were 'active' in 2013 (defined as earning a payment during the year) was $1,704.08.[16]
In a 2010 court case Advocare said that it had around 60,000 active distributors, and had sold approximately 350,000 distributorships since 2003.[6]
AdvoCare is a member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association (DSA), and participated in the 2010 DSA Code of Ethics Communication Initiative.[17] AdvoCare President Richard Wright served on the DSA Board of Directors in 2011.[18]
Sponsorships and Endorsements[edit]




Trevor Bayne's AdvoCare-branded Ford Mustang in NASCAR competition.


Among AdvoCare's contracted celebrity endorsers are NFL quarterbacks Andy Dalton, Philip Rivers and Alex Smith; Major League Baseball pitcher Doug Fister; CrossFit champion Rich Froning; and, previously, Carli Lloyd, Sam Bradford, and Wes Welker.[9] However, their most important spokesman is New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees.[9] Celebrity endorsers are said to be central to "the Bulletproof Shield," a key sales and recruitment technique used by the company: distributors place themselves at the center of a chart illustrating the company's endorsements and members of its scientific and medical advisory board, and deflects questions about the company by replying, "Well, I don't know about (X), but what I do know is" that particular athletes or doctors have endorsed AdvoCare.[9]
From 2009 until 2013, AdvoCare was the title sponsor of the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana. The 2013 game was known as the AdvoCare V100 Bowl.[19][20][21] In 2012, AdvoCare partnered with the Major League Soccer team FC Dallas and became its jersey sponsor.[22]
In 2014, AdvoCare secured the naming rights of a professional sports practice facility located at The Greenbrier in West Virginia.[23] The facility was named the AdvoCare Sports Performance Center and hosted the 2014 training camp for the New Orleans Saints.[24][25][26] AdvoCare also became the title sponsor of the 2014 Texas Bowl.[27] In 2016, AdvoCare will be sponsoring the Texas Kickoff and Cowboys Classic games.[28][29]
Since 2011,[30][31] AdvoCare has sponsored several NASCAR racing teams, as well as races at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway.[30][31] The company has sponsored driver Trevor Bayne and Roush Fenway Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and Xfinity Series since 2014.[9][32]
Controversy[edit]
In July 2008, Olympic swimmer Jessica Hardy tested positive for the banned breathing enhancer, clenbuterol. Hardy said she had never heard of the substance, attributing the positive result to either a tainted supplement or sabotage.[33][34] At the time, Hardy had been taking the supplement Arginine Extreme, which she had received for free from AdvoCare in exchange for making product testimonials,[35][36] and she claimed in a subsequent lawsuit that the company's product was tainted.[37] AdvoCare sued Hardy for making false claims.[38] An arbitration hearing reduced Hardy's suspension after a scientific expert testified that the AdvoCare product was tainted. AdvoCare disputed the panel's findings, saying that two independent laboratories had not found any evidence of Clenbuterol in the supplements.[39]
In 2009, a Dallas County jury awarded $1.9 million in damages against AdvoCare after finding that the company had engaged in deceptive trade practices and unfairly canceled agreements with two of its distributors.[40] According to the lawsuit, litigants Bruce and Teresa Badgett of Arlington, Texas, had been active and profitable marketers of AdvoCare products for more than a dozen years before their distributorship was canceled by the company in 2006 "based upon vague and trumped-up charges." The jury found that AdvoCare engaged in false, misleading or deceptive practices that damaged the Badgetts and that the termination provisions of the distributor contract with AdvoCare were unconscionable, according to court documents. AdvoCare disputed the ruling[40] and on April 30, 2010, filed to appeal the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs were not customers and therefore did not fit the statutory definition necessary to be covered under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[41] The appeal was dismissed on March 13, 2012 and the company was ordered to reimburse the Badgett's for court costs related to their defense in the appeal case.[42]
AdvoCare ceased offering KickStart Spark, targeted to youth age 4-11, after pediatricians had expressed concerns about the product containing 60 mg of caffeine.[43] AdvoCare was also the subject of criticism for its marketing at youth athletic events. In 2005, the company paid $5,000 to sponsor a high school wrestling tournament in Sacramento but after negative publicity, AdvoCare officials said they would not sponsor any more school events.[43]
Wendy Miller of the Beaumont Weight Control Center said AdvoCare's Herbal Cleanse is probably safe for many users, but she suggested that the same results could be achieved without the products.[44]
In March 2016, Advocare was the subject of a critical exposée in ESPN The Magazine. The exposée argues that the company and a small number of distributors at the top of a distribution network makes most of its money from the signing-up of new distributors rather than sales of the product, while exaggerating the likelihood of financial success of distributors when only a few make a significant amount of money; that the company creates a cult-like atmosphere of not questioning the company's claims or the probability of financial success in new distributors, to the point where distributors will shun friends and family members who do so; and that the company is internally riven by divisions over the company's strong use of religious affiliation as part of its business model, with more devout members of the organization using it to gain and hold power in the organization and over its members.[9]

Hardy said she had never heard of the substance, attributing the positive result to either a tainted supplement or sabotage.[33][34] At the time, Hardy had been taking the supplement Arginine Extreme, which she had received for free from AdvoCare in exchange for making product testimonials,[35][36] and she claimed in a subsequent lawsuit that the company's product was tainted.[37] AdvoCare sued Hardy for making false claims.[38] An arbitration hearing reduced Hardy's suspension after a scientific expert testified that the AdvoCare product was tainted. AdvoCare disputed the panel's findings, saying that two independent laboratories had not found any evidence of Clenbuterol in the supplements.[39]
In 2009, a Dallas County jury awarded $1.9 million in damages against AdvoCare after finding that the company had engaged in deceptive trade practices and unfairly canceled agreements with two of its distributors.[40] According to the lawsuit, litigants Bruce and Teresa Badgett of Arlington, Texas, had been active and profitable marketers of AdvoCare products for more than a dozen years before their distributorship was canceled by the company in 2006 "based upon vague and trumped-up charges." The jury found that AdvoCare engaged in false, misleading or deceptive practices that damaged the Badgetts and that the termination provisions of the distributor contract with AdvoCare were unconscionable, according to court documents. AdvoCare disputed the ruling[40] and on April 30, 2010, filed to appeal the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs were not customers and therefore did not fit the statutory definition necessary to be covered under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[41] The appeal was dismissed on March 13, 2012 and the company was ordered to reimburse the Badgett's for court costs related to their defense in the appeal case.[42]
AdvoCare ceased offering KickStart Spark, targeted to youth age 4-11, after pediatricians had expressed concerns about the product containing 60 mg of caffeine.[43] AdvoCare was also the subject of criticism for its marketing at youth athletic events. In 2005, the company paid $5,000 to sponsor a high school wrestling tournament in Sacramento but after negative publicity, AdvoCare officials said they would not sponsor any more school events.[43]
Wendy Miller of the Beaumont Weight Control Center said AdvoCare's Herbal Cleanse is probably safe for many users, but she suggested that the same results could be achieved without the products.[44]
In March 2016, Advocare was the subject of a critical exposée in ESPN The Magazine. The exposée argues that the company and a small number of distributors at the top of a distribution network makes most of its money from the signing-up of new distributors rather than sales of the product, while exaggerating the likelihood of financial success of distributors when only a few make a significant amount of money; that the company creates a cult-like atmosphere of not questioning the company's claims or the probability of financial success in new distributors, to the point where distributors will shun friends and family members who do so; and that the company is internally riven by divisions over the company's strong use of religious affiliation as part of its business model, with more devout members of the organization using it to gain and hold power in the organization and over its members.[9]

History[edit]
Charles Ragus founded AdvoCare in 1993 as a multi-level marketing (MLM) company that distributes dietary supplement products.[7][8] The name AdvoCare is short for "Advocates Who Care".[9] Before founding AdvoCare, Ragus worked as a regional vice president for Fidelity Union Insurance, and as a multi-level marketing (MLM) distributor for Herbalife. He had initially founded the MLM company Omnitrition International in 1989. Ragus briefly played defensive end for the National Football League's Kansas City Chiefs in the 1960s.[9][10][11] He died in 2001 at the age 58.[12][13]
In May 2007, Richard H. Wright became president and CEO of AdvoCare. Wright had previously served as Chief of Staff for US Representative Jim McCrery.[7][14]
Products[edit]
AdvoCare sells several lines of dietary supplements under the brand names Trim, Active, Well, Performance Elite, Fit, and 24 Day Challenge.[15]
Business[edit]
AdvoCare is a multilevel marketing company.[3][4][5] In addition to revenue from product sales, AdvoCare distributors can potentially earn additional commissions from sales by their 'downline' distributors. According to the company's 2013 Income disclosure statement, the average annual income, not including expenses, for AdvoCare distributors who were 'active' in 2013 (defined as earning a payment during the year) was $1,704.08.[16]
In a 2010 court case Advocare said that it had around 60,000 active distributors, and had sold approximately 350,000 distributorships since 2003.[6]
AdvoCare is a member of the U.S. Direct Selling Association (DSA), and participated in the 2010 DSA Code of Ethics Communication Initiative.[17] AdvoCare President Richard Wright served on the DSA Board of Directors in 2011.[18]
Sponsorships and Endorsements[edit]




Trevor Bayne's AdvoCare-branded Ford Mustang in NASCAR competition.


Among AdvoCare's contracted celebrity endorsers are NFL quarterbacks Andy Dalton, Philip Rivers and Alex Smith; Major League Baseball pitcher Doug Fister; CrossFit champion Rich Froning; and, previously, Carli Lloyd, Sam Bradford, and Wes Welker.[9] However, their most important spokesman is New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees.[9] Celebrity endorsers are said to be central to "the Bulletproof Shield," a key sales and recruitment technique used by the company: distributors place themselves at the center of a chart illustrating the company's endorsements and members of its scientific and medical advisory board, and deflects questions about the company by replying, "Well, I don't know about (X), but what I do know is" that particular athletes or doctors have endorsed AdvoCare.[9]
From 2009 until 2013, AdvoCare was the title sponsor of the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana. The 2013 game was known as the AdvoCare V100 Bowl.[19][20][21] In 2012, AdvoCare partnered with the Major League Soccer team FC Dallas and became its jersey sponsor.[22]
In 2014, AdvoCare secured the naming rights of a professional sports practice facility located at The Greenbrier in West Virginia.[23] The facility was named the AdvoCare Sports Performance Center and hosted the 2014 training camp for the New Orleans Saints.[24][25][26] AdvoCare also became the title sponsor of the 2014 Texas Bowl.[27] In 2016, AdvoCare will be sponsoring the Texas Kickoff and Cowboys Classic games.[28][29]
Since 2011,[30][31] AdvoCare has sponsored several NASCAR racing teams, as well as races at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Phoenix International Raceway.[30][31] The company has sponsored driver Trevor Bayne and Roush Fenway Racing in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series and Xfinity Series since 2014.[9][32]
Controversy[edit]
In July 2008, Olympic swimmer Jessica Hardy tested positive for the banned breathing enhancer, clenbuterol. Hardy said she had never heard of the substance, attributing the positive result to either a tainted supplement or sabotage.[33][34] At the time, Hardy had been taking the supplement Arginine Extreme, which she had received for free from AdvoCare in exchange for making product testimonials,[35][36] and she claimed in a subsequent lawsuit that the company's product was tainted.[37] AdvoCare sued Hardy for making false claims.[38] An arbitration hearing reduced Hardy's suspension after a scientific expert testified that the AdvoCare product was tainted. AdvoCare disputed the panel's findings, saying that two independent laboratories had not found any evidence of Clenbuterol in the supplements.[39]
In 2009, a Dallas County jury awarded $1.9 million in damages against AdvoCare after finding that the company had engaged in deceptive trade practices and unfairly canceled agreements with two of its distributors.[40] According to the lawsuit, litigants Bruce and Teresa Badgett of Arlington, Texas, had been active and profitable marketers of AdvoCare products for more than a dozen years before their distributorship was canceled by the company in 2006 "based upon vague and trumped-up charges." The jury found that AdvoCare engaged in false, misleading or deceptive practices that damaged the Badgetts and that the termination provisions of the distributor contract with AdvoCare were unconscionable, according to court documents. AdvoCare disputed the ruling[40] and on April 30, 2010, filed to appeal the decision on the basis that the plaintiffs were not customers and therefore did not fit the statutory definition necessary to be covered under the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.[41] The appeal was dismissed on March 13, 2012 and the company was ordered to reimburse the Badgett's for court costs related to their defense in the appeal case.[42]

Wright, Richard.

Richard Wright's ground-breaking novel Native Son tells the story of 20-year-old Bigger Thomas, an African American living in utter poverty in Chicago's South Side ghetto in the 1930s.

It made impossible a repetition of the old lies [and] brought out into the open, as no one ever had before, the hatred, fear and violence that have crippled and may yet destroy our culture" (Irving Howe).

Product Description Richard Wright grew up in the woods of Mississippi amid poverty, hunger, fear, and hatred. He lied, stole, and raged at those around him; at six he was a "drunkard," hanging about in taverns. Surly, brutal, cold, suspicious, and self-pitying, he was surrounded on one side by whites who were either indifferent to him, pitying, or cruel, and on the other by blacks who resented anyone trying to rise above the common lot.  "Black Boy" is Richard Wright's powerful account of his journey from innocence to experience in the Jim Crow South. It is at once an unashamed confession and a profound indictment--a poignant and disturbing record of social injustice and human suffering.More Product InformationPublisher: Harper Perennial

Article excerpt

I. INTRODUCTION
More than any other area of tort law, the law of product liability has been the subject of continuing debate regarding the interrelated issues of its proper rationales and grounds of liability. Although the seeds of the debate go back at least 100 years, it flowered into its mature form in 1944 in Escola v. Coca Cola Bottling Co.,1 in which the majority of the California Supreme Court used an expansive application of the res ipsa loquitur doctrine to hold the defendant liable for inferred negligence.2 In a concurring opinion, Justice Roger Traynor relied on four different rationales-efficient compensation, efficient deterrence, inferred negligence, and consumer expectations3-to argue that liability for defective products should be strict.4 Almost twenty years later, in 1963, Traynor's rationales and position were ratified and adopted in an opinion that he wrote for a unanimous court in Greenman v. Yuba Power Products, Inc.5 The Greenman opinion was a catalyst for the adoption of strict product liability, based on the same rationales, in Restatement Second section 402A,6 which in turn was rapidly adopted by most states in the United States and greatly influenced the adoption of product liability laws in other countries.7
However, as the courts attempted to apply strict liability as articulated in section 402A, renewed debate developed on the proper extent and grounds of product liability.8 By the time the Restatement Third was being drafted, it was generally agreed, at least among the courts, that liability for construction defects should be strict and that liability for warning defects should be based on negligence, while considerable disagreement remained about the proper grounds of liability for design defects.9 The Restatement Third continues to invoke all four of the rationales that Traynor set forth in Escola-and a few more-to support strict liability for construction defects, but it asserts that those rationales do not support strict liability for design or warning defects, which it claims "are predicated on a different concept of responsibility"10 and were not prominent in the cases or a subject of significant consideration at the time that Restatement Second section 402A was drafted and adopted.11
It is true that at the time that section 402A was adopted no clear distinction was drawn between construction defects and design or warning defects, but this is not because little consideration was given to design or warning defects, but rather because the prevailing academic and judicial view was that there was no need to distinguish the types of defect since it was assumed that strict liability should apply regardless of the type of defect. Greenman itself involved a design defect, which the court loosely described as a "defect in design and manufacture,"12 and section 402A clearly was meant to encompass design and warning defects as well as construction defects. Their inclusion was the reason for the insertion of the mischievous phrase "unreasonably dangerous" in section 402A. This phrase, along with repetitive language in comments h through k, was intended to preclude strict liability for generic product risks if, but only if, those risks were unavoidable aspects of a useful and reasonably safe product and proper warnings were provided.13
The Restatement Third's rote invocation of the efficiency rationales is unfortunate, not merely because they are normatively unappealing14 but also because they fail to explain or justify the differential treatment of construction defects and design and warning defects, or indeed any of the content or structure of past or current product liability law,15 which however can be explained and justified by Traynor's other rationales, which are based on interactive justice rather than efficiency.16 Except for its making the existence of a reasonable alternative design an independent requirement that the plaintiff must prove to establish a design defect, rather than only a factor to be considered in its consumer-oriented risk-utility analysis of reasonableness, the Restatement Third's substantive provisions and comments present a generally accurate description of current product liability law. …
