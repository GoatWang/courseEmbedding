Sequitur Labs and SELTECH will cooperate on developing and deploying innovative security solutions for embedded systems and Internet of Things







Sequitur Labs and SELTECH will cooperate on developing and deploying innovative security solutions for embedded systems and Internet of Things

CoreTEE will complement SELTECH’s OS independent FOXvisor and help system integrators to build secure system applications.


SEATTLE (PRWEB)
November 28, 2016
 Sequitur Labs Inc. and SELTECH Corporation, Japan’s leading embedded security solutions provider, announced a wide-ranging partnership to address the security needs of the rapidly growing Asian market for embedded systems and Internet of Things (IoT). 
As part of the agreement, Sequitur will integrate CoreTEE™—a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) for devices built on ARM® Cortex-A®—with SELTECH’s FOXvisor—a hypervisor for embedded devices capable of supporting multiple operating systems. Integration between CoreTEE and FOXvisor will initially support NXP’s i.MX6 SoC, including the quad core SABRE platform targeted at automotive entertainment, as well as the other i.MX SoCs. Additionally, the two companies will also collaborate on market development activities and custom solution development.  
Comprehensive Security Suite for IoT and Embedded Devices 
Sequitur’s security solutions span microcontroller and microprocessor-based devices. CoreTEE already supports TrustZone implementations on a number of Cortex-A platforms including Microchip’s SMART | A5D2 and A5D4, NXP’s QorIQ LS1 family, as well as i.MX6 and i.MX7 platforms. “Our agreement with SELTECH draws on complementary capabilities of each company,” said Philip Attfield, CEO of Sequitur Labs. “Combining our solutions with FOXvisor allows any device maker to quickly implement a scalable security strategy.
Small Footprint Bare Metal Security Solution for IoT and Embedded Devices 
SELTECH’s Hypervisor solution supports major CPU IP, SoC platform vendors and OEM customers. SELTECH announced the availability of the Cortex-A9 based FOXvisor (IKUSADACHI) Starter Kit in April 2016. 
“We are very pleased to collaborate with Sequitur Labs who support the CoreTEE solution on to the Starter Kit. SELTECH will address secure application development for automotive, industrial automation, medical, POS, and home automation applications," said Soi Egawa, president and CEO of SELTECH. "CoreTEE will compliment SELTECH's OS independent FOXvisor and help system integrators to build secure system applications."

t


For Microprocessors
We provide foundational security solutions for microprocessor and microcontroller-based products. Sequitur’s CoreTEETM is a secure OS for ARM® TrustZone® enabled ARM Cortex®-A microprocessors. It enables device manufacturers to make use of TrustZone’s isolation capability and provides services necessary to secure interrupts, functions and peripherals.








t


For Microcontrollers
Sequitur also delivers a way to secure microcontroller products based on ARM® Cortex®-M23 and M33 architectures. CoreLockr-TZTM provides a small footprint middleware layer simplifying access to the new protected memory architecture available on the M23 and M33.








t


Other Architectures & Cores
For products based on older ARM microcontroller architectures and non-ARM cores, Sequitur’s CoreLockrTM provides a service dispatch layer that simplifies communications across disparate domains. CoreLockr’s architecture simplifies communications between processor cores or between networked devices by exposing simple APIs and services to accomplish inter-domain communication tasks.













By Security Objective





Sequitur’s products allow you to achieve your “secure-by-design” goals. We bring to bear our considerable security expertise and foresight to develop solutions that protect your product through its lifecycle - from manufacturing to decommissioning. Our solutions enable you to deploy one or more of the following capabilities:
