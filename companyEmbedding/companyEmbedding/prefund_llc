FAQs
Got Questions? We have answers


Q: How much does Refundo cost?


A: Refundo's fees are simple. We only charge $34.95 for our refund transfer product. While your tax software may have additional charges, Refundo's fee structure is still lower than other processors, giving you and your clients the price advantage.





Q: Where can my clients cash Refundo checks?


A: As part of our CheckSelect program, we currently have BB&T, Capital One, Bank of the West, BBVA Compass and Walmart as options. Our goal is to continue placing strong footholds with great partners across the country. This helps facilitate your needs and provide options for success.
Having more bank options will enable you to better serve your clients. As you are probably aware, check cashers charge about 2-3% to cash a refund check. This can be a significant portion, depending on the tax refund amount. On our side, we keep it simple. Your clients can cash their checks for under $8 nationwide. We understand the value our program adds to you, your clients, and your overall business.





Q: I'm a Service Bureau. Can I use Refundo? 


A: Yes, we love working with Service Bureaus. In fact we offer an excellent Service Bureau management utility called SB Center that gives you access to information at all levels of your organization including fees, revenue, daily activity, centralized reporting, check printing capabilities and more.





Q: How can taxpayers check on their refund status?


A: Refundo offers several ways to do this. First, they can check the IRS Website for information. We recommend that they download our Where’s My Refundo Mobile App to receive the most up to date information about the status of their refund right from their mobile phone. The app is available on iOS and Android. Otherwise, your clients can call Refundo's customer service team at (908) 445-5544.





Q: What tax software do you work with?


A: Refundo is fully integrated with or is able to work automatically alongside all major tax software products on the market today.

WHY?

NOW you can offer $1,000 refund advances






Be Competitive
Stand out from the competition by offering refund advances







Be a Hero
Empower your client to be financially independent







Be Original
Associate your brand with innovation and trust










HOW IT WORKS?



1
Your client needs to file a tax return, but doesn’t have money to pay for preparation fees and is short on cash.


2
Then your client might ask, “Is there a possibility to receive an advance from my anticipated tax refund?”





Yes
You gained a new client.




No
You lost a client.





3
Then you refer to the NOW Advance. If your client qualifies for the refund advance, then they’re able to walk away with refund advance within 24 hours. 




4
Whenever funds are received from IRS, Refundo automatically deducts your fees and refund advance.  




5
The remainder is disbursed via check or direct deposit to taxpayer.

Expansion Capital Group Announces PreFund ProductMarch 1, 2016

 SIOUX FALLS, SOUTH DAKOTA (March 1, 2016) – Expansion Capital Group is pleased to announce ECG PreFund, a financing product for small- to medium-sized businesses who want to accelerate and smooth out their business cash flow cycles.
Slow or late payments are the most significant issue businesses encounter when it comes to getting the money they’re rightfully owed.  Nearly 40% of companies surveyed said receivables are coming in at a slower pace than before (National Federation of Independent Businesses).   The delays affect cash flow, making it tough to for small businesses to meet payroll, pay rent or buy supplies. In addition, delinquent payments can put small businesses in the uncomfortable position of deciding whether or not to continue a relationship with a customer. 
“So many companies we work with struggle to pay their bills because their customers delay payment,” says SVP of Business Development Steve Beveridge.  “This puts the small business’ own credit worthiness on the line.  Instead of being handcuffed to a customer’s payment schedule, small businesses can take advantage of our new ECG PreFund product and get the cash they need so they can spend time focusing on what’s really important— running their business.”
ECG PreFund advances capital to small business owners based on the company’s invoice and billing history. With ECG PreFund, a business can sell outstanding billed invoices to ECG and receive an electronic advance of 80%- 100% of the invoice value within 24-48 hours. ECG may retain a “reserve” as a buffer in case of non-payment or extensive delays from the provider.  The reserve, less a fee, will then be returned upon receipt of payments from the third-party payer.
“ECG PreFund was exactly what my company needed,” said Tim James from James Foods  “We received several larger than normal orders thus causing us to require additional raw materials (chicken and dough) and were able to sell a few of our outstanding invoices to ECG, and within a day we had all the cash we needed.”
Founded in July 2013, ECG’s mission is to help American business owners succeed by providing extremely convenient capital. ECG has grown quickly by helping established small businesses get the capital they need for expansion.  From food trucks to restaurants, from gas stations to trucking fleets, from niche hotels to large healthcare clinics, ECG has been the financial partner to over 5,000 entrepreneurs and their visions.
If you’re interested in learning more about ECG PreFund please visit us at ecgprefund.com or call us at (844) 619-4590. Please have ready your last 6 months of invoicing/billing activity as that will help guide the discussion.
If you’re a revenue management company or a medical billing organization, ECG can also partner to offer ECG PreFund to your clients.
About ECG

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
