	Explanation of Responses:








	(


	1) 





	This Form 3 is filed jointly by Levin Capital Strategies, L.P. ("LCS"), Levin Capital Strategies GP, LLC ("LCS GP"), Levin Capital Trilogy Master Fund, Ltd. ("Trilogy"), LCS, LLC ("LCSL"), Levcap Alternative Fund, L.P. ("Levcap"), LCS Event Partners, LLC ("LCSEP"), Safinia Partners, L.P. ("Safinia"), LCS L/S, LLC ("LCSLS"), and John A. Levin (collectively, the "Reporting Persons").







	(


	2) 





	The Reporting Persons are passive investors in the Issuer and are voluntarily filing this Form 3 as a result of acquiring over 20% of the Issuer's outstanding shares of Common Stock. The Reporting Persons have not acquired the shares with a purpose or effect of changing or influencing control of the Issuer. Pursuant to Rule 16a-1(a)(4) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), this filing shall not be construed as an admission that the Reporting Persons are, for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act or otherwise, the beneficial owners of any of the securities reported herein under Section 16 or otherwise. Each of the Reporting Persons specifically disclaims beneficial ownership of the securities reported herein that are not directly owned by such Reporting Person, except to the extent of their pecuniary interest therein.







	(


	3) 





	Shares owned directly by Trilogy. LCSL, as the general partner of the domestic feeder fund which owns a controlling interest in Trilogy, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Trilogy. LCS, as the investment advisor of Trilogy, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Trilogy. Mr. Levin, as the Chief Executive Officer of LCS, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Trilogy.







	(


	4) 





	Shares owned directly by Levcap. LCSEP, as the general partner of Levcap, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Levcap. LCS, as the investment advisor of Levcap, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Levcap. Mr. Levin, as the Chief Executive Officer of LCS, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Levcap.







	(


	5) 





	Shares owned directly by Safinia. LCSLS, as the general partner of Safinia, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Safinia. LCS, as the investment advisor of Safinia, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Safinia. Mr. Levin, as the Chief Executive Officer of LCS, may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over the shares owned directly by Safinia.










	Remarks:



	As the investment manager to certain managed accounts (the "Managed Accounts"), LCS may be deemed to share dispositive over 6,136,241 shares held in the Managed Accounts and may be deemed to share voting power over only 4,296,969 of such shares. As the sub-investment advisor to Transamerica Large Cap Value Fund ("Transamerica"), LCS may be deemed to share voting and dispositive power over 1,098,376 shares held by Transamerica. LCS receives an asset-based management fee for serving as investment manager to the Managed Accounts, except that with respect to 50,711 shares held in Managed Accounts, LCS receives a performance-based incentive fee. The performance-based incentive fee LCS receives for such Managed Accounts does not constitute a reportable pecuniary interest under Section 16a-1(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, as such fee is based on the performance of the overall account, over a period of one year or more and the shares of the Issuer held in such accounts constitute no more than 10% of the market value thereof. LCS receives an asset-based management fee for serving as sub-investment advisor to Transamerica. Accordingly, LCS does not have a reportable pecuniary interest in the shares held by Transamerica or the shares held in the Managed Accounts. In addition, none of LCS GP, Trilogy, LCSL, Levcap, LCSEP, Safinia, LCSLS and Mr. Levin have a reportable pecuniary interest in the shares held by Transamerica or the shares held in the Managed Accounts.
