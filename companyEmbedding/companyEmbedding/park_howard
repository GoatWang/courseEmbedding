Miller founded in 1926, at the age of 21. Even then, Howard Miller understood the need to create products that would be steeped in quality and value.Howard Miller was schooled in the fine art of clockmaking by his father, Herman, in the Black Forest region of Germany. Howard developed into a visionary whose keen sense of innovation spawned a tradition of excellence that has been uncompromised through three generations.A highly respected brand, Howard Miller maintains its popularity because of the company's commitment to quality. Every product manufactured at the company's sprawling facility in Zeeland, Michigan, undergoes stringent tests and exceeds industry standards to ensure a lifetime of enjoyment.

Skin Care Products 

Doctor’s Dermatologic Formula, is a therapeutic skincare line encompassing multiple healthcare disciplines, including dermatology, holistic medicine, nutrition, biology, chemistry and aesthetics, to provide the most comprehensive solutions available without a prescription. Founded by Dr. Howard Sobel, in 1991, it was the first complete doctor skin care line. It was the 1st to use BOTOX® like creams (wrinkle relax) to help improve wrinkles for patients not wanting BOTOX® injections.
The line made it easier for the consumers to treat their skin care concerns at home. We offer a complete line of for all skin conditions. For information or to order our products please check out our skin care site at www.ddfskincare.com.
History of DDF

When I first started creating my own formulations in the early 80’s, the term cosmeceuticals was in its infancy stage. Patients were coming to my office not understanding what OTC products to use or using the wrong products for their skin issues. I initially saw a need to effectively take care of my patients and have them leave my office with the correct products and simple instructions for use at home.
I began by using my dermatology skills to find the most efficacious ingredients and then partner with a biochemist to create formulations that would really work. We focused on treating various skin concerns, using the synergistic effect of several active ingredients in each product. My patients, friends and family were all very excited to use a new product, hoping it would be the cure for their skin concern. I received instant feedback, both positive and negative. It was a learning experience as we all worked together to produce the best possible products. Over time, the product line grew. Many of my patients had started purchasing products in bulk to give to their friends and relatives. For the first 10 years, although I received thousands of calls and letters from consumers who wanted to purchase the products, I would only allow patients in my office to order them.
In 1991 I decided to make my products available to the consumer and founded HDS.  It was a difficult decision because I wanted to maintain the same quality control that I had in my office. However, the loyalty and feedback of my patients gave me the desire to create a skincare line that would give the consumer the most efficacious products for their skin care concerns. This is how the DDF concept of skin concern developed: To teach the consumer a new way to think about skin care.
I changed the name of my products from HDS (Howard D. Sobel) to DDF (Doctors Dermatologic Formula) in 1995.  It was my decision to have a more global name that made it clear exactly who we were but always leaving my name as the founder, so the legacy of the company remained clearly linked to the credentials of a renowned N.Y.C. dermatologist. We also started a larger initiative by forming our own lab and securing our own biochemist. I was now able to put an idea (ingredient) into action quickly.
In 1998, DDF become one of the first doctor-formulated skin care lines to partner with Sephora and be prominently displayed. It gave DDF national and international exposure.
DDF never forgot its roots and continued to take the lead on my patients’ concerns. We continued to educate the salespeople at the retail stores as well as providing educational materials for the consumer. DDF changed the way the consumer thought of skincare. We treated the entire range of skincare- Prevention, Maintenance & Treatment. It is easy to take for granted the availability of cosmeceuticals now, but in 1991 DDF paved the way for the most innovative products that we see today.

'Jurassic World' Has a Brookstone? Product Placement Runs Wild in the Park | Hollywood Reporter
















































The Hollywood Reporter















































June 13, 2015

6:00am PT
by

Rebecca Ford 


'Jurassic World' Has a Brookstone? Product Placement Runs Wild in the Park



Courtesy of Universal Pictures
'Jurassic World'

















Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard need Mercedes and Margaritaville to help them save the park from a dinosaur attack.





Warning: Minor spoilers below
Jurassic World, which hit theaters on June 12, introduced viewers to a whole new dino-park, with plenty of upgrades ranging from the gyrosphere tour to the mosasaur water show. And with all these new upgrades, came a slew of new branded shops and restaurants.
The Universal and Legendary film, starring Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard, has almost as many brand tie-ins in it as it does new dinosaurs.

Here, The Hollywood Reporter highlights some of the most obvious product placements in the film:
1. Jimmy Fallon / The Tonight Show
When the two young brothers visiting the park (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins) take a trip in the gyrosphere to get up close to the dinosaurs, they're greeted by a video message from Jimmy Fallon. The Tonight Show host gives the riders instructions on how to stay safe in their vehicle as it travels through the park. Since The Tonight Show is on NBC, and the film is by Universal, it's corporate synergy at its finest.
2. Margaritaville
There's a very prominent Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville restaurant and bar located in the Jurassic World park. The parrot head-themed restaurant chain does actually have a location at Universal Orlando Resort, so it's not a stretch that there would be one located in the dinosaur park. But the reason behind the restaurant's brand showing up in the film is actually that Buffett is a longtime friend of Jurassic World producer Frank Marshall. Buffett even has a cameo in the film (and performed at the premiere party).

3. Verizon
The movie even pokes fun at corporate sponsors — while plugging corporate sponsors. To fund the new attractions at the park, Howard's character has to woo corporate sponsors. She has a meeting with some suits from Verizon Wireless, who agree to sponsor the arena for the new giant hybrid dinosaur, the Indominus Rex.
4. Mercedes
When Pratt and Howard's characters are frantically rushing around the park trying to save all those lives, they do it in a Mercedes G63 6X6. The G-Wagon isn't the first Mercedes to make its way into a Jurassic Park: The M-Class SUV was featured in Steven Spielberg's 1997 The Lost World: Jurassic Park. The 2015 film also includes the Mercedes GLE Coupe and the Sprinter van.




5. Starbucks and Ben & Jerry's
What would a theme park be without either?
6. Triumph Motorcycles
Pratt's character rides a Triumph Scrambler through the jungle as he's following around a pack of raptors. He's also seen working on the British motorcycle company's bike during a scene with Howard outside his living quarters at the park.
7. Brookstone
Signage for a Brookstone located in the park can be spotted in some of the sweeping overhead shots. Because who doesn't want to pick up a cordless Shiatsu massager or a Bluetooth thermometer while walking around a park full of dinosaurs?
8. Samsung
Samsung is the sponsor of the park's Innovation Center, which features interactive exhibits for park visitors. Also, everyone in the movie has a Samsung phone. It's actually the ringing of one such phone that alerts the Indominus Rex to the location of the trapped parkgoer.
9. Hilton Hotel
When the brothers first get to the island, they check into the five-star Hilton Isla Nublar Resort. A Hilton rug can be spotted in at least one shot.
10. Pandora
The charm bracelet chain has a shop in the park, where they offer unique gifts like the Mosasauras Tooth Pendant.
