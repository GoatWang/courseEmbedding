RapidMade - 3D Printing, Rapid Prototyping, Additive Manufacturing and Engineering Services


























Adam McGee's sons, Nicolas and Damon "ham" it up with Crowdcow







"CROWD COW" Project "Udder" Fun for RapidMade



RapidMade recently participated in Portland's 3D Printing Meetup group project, "Crowd Cow" which was unveiled last week at the Urban Farmer restaurant in the Nines hotel.  

Their latest “why not” project is half a life-sized cow, made of 99 pieces printed on 14 separate 3D printers representing 700 hours of printing. It’s in collaboration with Urban Farmer restaurant, who will add an interactive, multimedia component and display the cow in their front window, showcasing the different anatomy of the various meat cuts (Stephanie Yao Long, Oregonian Live).

The Crowdcow is a vivid example of 3D printing's ability to convey educational concepts in a concrete, understandable way that utilizes more of our senses.  It allows one to literally capture his or her imagination.  Many firms have asked RapidMade to help them educate clients, patients and students with hand-held replicas of body parts, industrial equipment and commercial products.   The life-sized cow?  That was "utterly" fun .     "

Profiles






















Crowd Cow is a website that sells beef to consumers directly from the farm through crowdfunding. Business ModelCrowd Cow allows consumers to crowdfund and pool their money to buy beef from small ranches. The company sells shares of the cow with each customer receiving a different cut. Once the entire cow is ordered by customers it "tips" and Crowd Cow will buy the meat from the farm after it has been dry aged and packaged. Crowd Cow then delivers the meat to the consumer within a week. [16]  ProductThe beef is dry aged, 100% grass-fed, grass-finished cattle from the Boistfort Valley in Southwestern Washington. The cattle spend their entire lives on the farm, and eat exclusively the product of the land on which they graze. The foundersThe cattle are a cross of the Angus cattle and Hereford cattle breeds. Angus are renowned for their marbling and delicious steaks. Herefords are unequaled for their adaptability. [5] HistoryThe company was founded by Joe Heitzeberg and Ethan Lowry in 2015 [15] . They were inspired to start he company after both Ethan and Joe had trouble buying high quality meats at a reasonable price [5] . Ethan shopped at upscale stores and thought the prices were far too high with all the middlemen involved. Joe had bought directly from farms but found it hard to organize payments and buy in a large enough quantity.

        Crowd Cow Lets Customers Buy a Cow on Its Crowdsourcing Platform | Fortune.comLeadershipSearchSearchFordU.S. Expands Probe Into Ford Explorers Over Carbon Monoxide ConcernsWMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: July 28COMPARECARDSSPONSOREDUberUber’s CEO Searchlight Reportedly Hits Former GE Head Jeff ImmeltCourtesy of Crowd CowbeefThis Startup Lets You Buy a Cow With Strangers on the InternetPolina MarinovaMar 07, 2017Introducing the newest member of the sharing economy: cow-sharing startup Crowd Cow.A Seattle-based startup has made it possible for you to buy a cow with strangers on the Internet. Here's how it works: You would go on the crowdfunding platform to watch an informational video about a cattle ranch and learn how a cow was raised. Then, you select the cuts you would like to buy. The various cuts are called “shares,” making you a “steakholder” in the individual cow.Once all of the shares are purchased, the cow “tips,” and the beef is shipped directly to your home. If the cow is not fully sold, your credit card will not be charged.Foodies pay anywhere from $12 to $219 depending on the cut, plus a flat shipping rate of $12.99. There’s consumer demand for every part, including the kidneys, liver, and tongue. ("We don’t sell the hooves," says Crowd Cow co-founder Joe Heitzeberg, "but I’ve been asked for hooves.”)Founded in 2015, the startup works with a dozen independent ranchers to help sell their cattle directly to consumers. Historically, traditional cattle ranchers have sold their beef through public auctions, small butchers, or specialty restaurants. Crowd Cow changes up the model by connecting the rancher more directly with the consumer.Once the startup purchases a cow, it takes on the marketing, packaging, and shipping on behalf of the farmer. The key to ensuring this doesn’t become a logistical headache? Technology.“It’s a nightmare that we’ve tamed over time,” Heitzeberg says. “Every cut is vacuum-sealed, frozen, and barcoded. There’s a whole computer that tells us how much dry ice to put in a box.” Courtesy of Crowd Cow The company prides itself on the quality of its meat: It offers grass-fed, grass-finished, dry-aged Angus beef as well as meat from a rare Japanese cattle breed called Wagyu. The company ships to 15 states west of the Mississippi, but it’s now aggressively expanding to the East Coast.To fund its efforts, Crowd Cow has raised $2 million in venture capital from Fuel Capital, Maveron Capital, Zulily founders Mark Vadon and Darrell Cavens, and ex-NFL player Joe Montana. In less than two years, Crowd Cow has generated more than $1 million in sales.Heitzeberg is eager to prove that consumers want this level of transparency and detail about the food they eat. In the past, the company has used its platform to sell turkeys and wine.“A steak is a good $20 on your plate. Why shouldn’t you know what kind of steak it is and where it came from?” he posits. “We want to create this new supply chain that directly connects consumers to producers with all sorts of products.”Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers© 2017 Time Inc.

Crowd Cow Frequenty Asked Questions


































































Frequently Asked Questions

How does Crowd Cow work?

Crowd Cow lets you buy a cow with friends. We source animals from small, independent ranches around the country who produce the best beef anywhere. You pick the exact cuts and quantity you want and we deliver straight to your door. Claim a share, rally your friends, and become a "steak holder"!


How much beef do I get?

You pick the exact cuts you want, and buy as little or as much as you want. No surprises!


Will it fit in my freezer?

Most people order 5 to 10 lbs at a time and have no trouble fitting that into the available freezer space of an ordinary home refrigerator.


Where do you deliver?

We ship everywhere in the USA except Alaska and Hawaii.


What kind of ranches do you work with?

We source 100% of our beef directly through independent producers who raise their herds from birth to harvest -- never from concentrated feedlots or meat brokers. We shine the spotlight on the producers and their families, and share as much as possible about the breed and how they care for their animals and the environment. This typically means family-run farms and beef that is grass-fed, grass-finished. When you buy on Crowd Cow, you will always know exactly where your beef came from, who raised it and how it was raised.


Is Crowd Cow good for farmers?

Yes. In this country, farmers face a dilemma: either auction off to the industrial beef world, or sell on their own. Crowd Cow helps small producers reach more customers by handling the marketing, support and logistics so their beef can reach many more customers than they can on their own. See https://www.crowdcow.com/farms


What is the fat content of the ground beef?

Our hamburger is about 80/20. This is ground beef animals who are raised to produce steaks and which has been dry-aged. It’s truly unlike any ground beef you’ll find in stores.


I'm a cattle rancher. How can I offer my beef through Crowd Cow?

Please see Farms and Ranches


Can I earn FREE beef?

You bet! Refer friends and earn beef. Get Started


When will my credit card be charged?

Your card will be charged at the event's end date, or when the tipping point has been reached, whichever is sooner. Until then you can change your order or cancel at any time.


Is my credit card secure?

Yes. We use Stripe for payment processing, the same secure, 256-bit encrypted payment gateway trusted by OpenTable, Kickstarter, Lyft, Twitter and more. They store your credit card information and are fully PCI-compliant.


When will my order arrive?

After the event completes, orders are typically shipped the following week. We will give you the exact delivery date for your address when you place an order.


How do you choose your ranches?

We visit countless independent producers and work directly with the select few who we identify as having the highest quality beef and best practices. This typically means multi-generational, family-run farms whose beef is typically only available at specialty markets, farmer's markets, high-end restaurants and here on Crowd Cow.


Why do you dry-age the beef?

Dry-aged beef tastes better and is more tender. Supermarket beef is never dry-aged, and the very best steakhouse beef always is.


What if the cow doesn't tip?

If all of the primary shares do not sell before the campaign's end, the event will be cancelled and your credit card will not be charged.


How can I view my order status?

We'll email you to keep you up to date on the event and you can return to the site at any time, sign in and view the status of your order.


How will my beef be shipped?

Our steaks and roasts are vacuum sealed in sous vide-ready pouches. Ground beef and patties are vacuum sealed in one pound packs. Bones are wrapped in butcher paper as three pound packs. All are flash-frozen and packed in an insulated box with dry ice for delivery direct to your door. All of our beef is USDA inspected.


Do I need to be around the day my shipment arrives?

You will not need to be home or sign for your package and it will be packed to stay nice and cold for many hours after it arrives. That said, you should plan to unpack it and put it away in your freezer or fridge as soon as possible. After package is confirmed as delivered by the carrier, what happens to it after is your responsibility.


Will I be able to track my delivery?

Yes, we provide your choice of delivery status updates via email or SMS.


What exactly will be in my order?

You'll receive the cuts and portions described in each of your selection's descriptions, however the exact cuts and quantities may vary, since the weight of each animal, dry-aging and preparation may result in slight variances.


What if I still have questions?

We're happy to help. Please email moo@crowdcow.com or send a text message to (206) 539-0639.


How much is shipping?

Shipping is $12.99 no matter how much you buy, no matter where it ships (we ship everywhere in the lower 48 states.)

DefaultShowing 13 FatCow reviewsAlyson T.Review SourceAlyson T.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceNot the best I've usedUpdated On January 11, 2016Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?The easy to use website builders are great.  It is also nice that they give you no limits on disk space or transfers.  Initial set up was very easy as well. Low start up cost makes this a good value for the money if you are just starting out.  Website set up is almost instant so you can get started right away on site building.  There are many positives to this hosting service.  What do you dislike?Unfortunately, I have found that they are very slow to run wordpress sites, which is what I normally use, other hosting companies can run them much better and a lot faster.  I also found customer service to be lacking. I had issue with one of my wordpress sites and found that they had shut them all down.  It was a simple issue to fix, yet I spend hours and hours one the phone with a service rep.  My sites were down for almost a whole day, which in the world of online retail, is entirely too long.  Recommendations to others considering the productI would be careful if you are using wordpress sites and if you are setting up more than one site, get one up and running first and make sure the speed is up to par with what you need. You don't want to find yourself having to re-do more than one site.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as FatCowReport a ConcernAlejandro M.Review SourceAlejandro M.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceGreat prices!Updated On July 12, 2017Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?Its cost!

I never once personally experienced the server that our site was on being down or having issues that prevented access to our company site or custom domain email.  This was essential in our initial reasoning behind choosing FatCow.  Downtime equals lost sales, missed customers, and missed opportunities.What do you dislike?The price.  The price is low at first and is touted as being a cheap and economical host.  Once the trial period runs out though, the price jumps up and loses this factor.  The price after the trial period when compared to the services you get, is easily outdone by other major hosting providers.  The features at the new price point felt lacking and the support to help with the existing features was delayed and lackluster, although it did exist and the actual support representatives themselves were very friendly.Recommendations to others considering the productFatCow is great for an initial startup period to get your domain registered and get a website going.  Once the trial cost period ends, or if you need more advanced features with quick/efficient support, then it may be time to look at other hosting options unless FatCow starts relying more on competitive pricing/features and less on rank optimization and affiliate marketing for growing their customer base.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?I utilized FatCow for the domain and web hosting services they provided.  My startup at the time needed marketing, visibility, and consumer trust to be successful - and those can all be provided with a solid custom domain to match your company name, a reliable company site to promote visibility, and the primary web presence to generate your leads to.  I was satisfied with the services until I decided I wanted a new domain and looked closer at their services and out of trial period costs, at which point I realized their were alternatives that were more economical and feature rich - while maintaining a satisfactory enough up-time ratio.  They still have their niche in the hosting world, and as for up-time - can't be beat in my opinion, so I always keep a look out for promotions and changes in their pricing structure.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as FatCowReport a ConcernEdward C.Review SourceEdward C.Validated ReviewReview SourceDecent hosting service, but feels like the service has diminished over the yearsUpdated On April  3, 2016Validated ReviewWhat do you like best?FatCow is a hosting provider and gets the job done if you need to buy a domain and host your website. It is a quick solution for anyone who wants something minimal and something live quickly. Since FatCow is a pretty well-known hosting provider, they try their best to offer the best service to their customers.What do you dislike?Having been a FatCow customer for a long period of time, it feels like the customer service at FatCow has diminished over the years. I have had a website hosted on FatCow for about 6 years before I decided to make the move to a better provider (in my opinion), and never needed much assistance with anything - as most of the documentation was fairly easy to understand. However, when I did need some technical customer service support, there were a few things that were red alarms - 1) Their response time was pretty slow (24-48 hours); 2) Un-apologetic - the tone of the representatives I spoke with was rude and harsh; 3) The pricing actually almost doubled in the last 3 years of my service with them. It is disappointing to know that, being a long-time customer, I was not given a good customer service experience when I needed it.Recommendations to others considering the productI recommend hiring (or at least training) your customer service representatives to have more soft skills for interacting with their customers. It is crucial to any business to hire the best people - as those people who talk to your clients are the face of your company.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?I am a web developer looking for a place to host my own website and any client websites that I need to, for my freelance job. The benefits I have realized for FatCow is that it is easy to set up and get a website up and running within a few hours. This is beneficial to anyone in a time crunch or is looking to meet a deadline for a client without having to go through loopholes to set something up.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as FatCowReport a ConcernTimothy S.Review SourceTimothy S.Validated ReviewReview SourceFatcow for 4 yearsUpdated On March 31, 2016Validated ReviewWhat do you like best?FatCow is cheap and they have discounts and promos all the time. It works most of the time. It works well for wordpress.    I have a number of webdomains at Fatcow and they have been pretty good, it does cost more each year but not as bad as some of the other.  I would recommend this if you are doing wordpress only.What do you dislike?there are times they take things down for maintenance.    sometimes they get viruses.   some extra features that you want are extra money and they don't do backups for free. make sure you keep your own backups as either you pay a lot for backups or they don't do them.   they also can block your contact if it gets a virus, probably from shared area or wordpress flaw.Recommendations to others considering the productTry it out for non-critical hosting, like your own blog or personal site. Look for discounts and search from different browsers, link from different browsers, different times of day as different people will get different prices and different promo codes. Try it for yourself for a small site with the cheapest one month value.   And then decide.   Don't get a full year unless you can get it for $20 a year.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as FatCowReport a ConcernKristin S.Review SourceKristin S.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceGreen Web Hosting SiteUpdated On April  6, 2016Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?I like that FatCow is environmentally conscious and makes an effort to stay green with what they provide.

Crowd Cow: Our Story





































































Our Story


Co-founder Ethan went to an upscale grocery store to pick up some steaks and found himself wondering where the meat was from and why it cost so much.


In talking to his friend Joe, they discovered that many of their friends had purchased beef directly from local farms, and had bragged about how great the meat was. But the trouble of finding a good ranch, coordinating payment and pickup and the idea of having to purchase and store up to a year's worth of beef at once was too much.


There had to be a better way. Ethan suggested they “crowdfund a cow” so that 50 people could each buy a tiny amount of beef directly from a local farm. After a couple of weekends visiting ranches and building a website, Crowd Cow was launched and the first cow was sold in 24 hours.






Mission








Crowd Cow’s mission is to allow everyone to discover and enjoy the very best beef from small, independent ranches and to make the experience convenient and fun.


Crowd Cow is committed to showcasing and celebrating very best farms and the people who have dedicated their lives to producing healthy, high-quality meat you can trust.











How it Works








Crowd Cow lets you buy a cow with friends. Claim a share, rally your friends, tip the cow and become a “steak holder”.


Crowd Cow lets you buy the exact cuts and quantity you want direct from a farm with the ease of ordering online, delivered straight to your door.











Discover and Explore








We believe that beef should be enjoyed like wine, with an appreciation for the varieties and a deeper knowledge of the source of the food you consume.


A cow’s genetics, how it was raised, and how the meat is cut and prepared are easily as rich a subject as grapes, and are worthy of our attention.











Say Goodbye to Mystery Meat








Raising high quality beef in a sustainable way is both time-consuming and expensive. That’s why 84% of beef sold comes from industrialized processes and companies that probably don't want you to know how it reached you.


Crowd Cow puts an end to mystery meat.


Crowd Cow is the only brand in the world that provides direct access to small, independent ranches with the greatest possible level of transparency available anywhere.


And we’re committed to selling beef for a fair price so you can explore and enjoy the very best beef, support the ranchers who bring it to you and never overpay again.











We Love our Ranches






We meet a lot of ranches, but we only work with a select few. Like that scene from Portlandia, it’s important for us to walk the fields with the rancher, to understand their practices in-depth and to taste the meat before we’ll ever feature a ranch on Crowd Cow.


How about Angus from a ranch that's been breeding for marbling and natural immunity since the 70’s? Or the finest Purebred grass-finished Wagyu in the country, raised on a small farm in the San Juan Islands?


We regularly feature both on Crowd Cow and are always enthusiastic when we can discover and showcase outstanding independent farms to our customers.









An Idea Whose Time Has Come








Crowd Cow helps people explore all that beef offers, and facilitates a more direct connection with its source.


We're first and foremost a community that's passionate about high quality, nutritious and delicious food.


Selling beef just happens to be how we pay the bills.











Meet the Founders








We’ve been close friends for over 15 years and have worked together on many creative projects and companies.


Previously Ethan was the co-founder of Urbanspoon, and Joe headed the in-house startup incubator for Madrona Venture Group.


It's a pleasure building Crowd Cow to reflect our shared passions and values: high quality, healthy food, creating delightful customer experiences, creativity and a belief that customers should be treated like family, with honesty and respect.

The Farm


Hutterian Farm










Hutterian Farm


Located in the rich pasturelands of Eastern Washington, Hutterian Farm is owned and operated by the Spokane Hutterite Brethren. They are a communal group, working together to raise crops, beef and poultry for themselves and their local region.

A self-sustaining community, the Hutterites have their own church and schools, and follow their ancestors’ generation’s old tradition of conservation farming and land stewardship. Their cows graze on the Hutterite’s 130,000 acre farm, enjoying lush green grass as well as corn and peas raised by the members themselves. Animals raised in such a calm, peaceful way result in beef that’s delicious and beautifully marbled.

What Makes Hutterian Beef So Special


Each community member is elected to a position. On the Spokane Hutterian Farm, the role of tending to the beef herd goes to Ed Gross. An avid farmer since he was a young boy helping his uncle milk cows, Ed has since delved deeply into cow genetics and husbandry. 

His keen focus on growing a healthy, docile herd that yields tasty beef has lead to a unique blend of grass and grain-feeding for the community’s 100% Angus cattle. The cows graze on lush green pastures, and then are finished with corn and peas grown on the community’s very own farms. The end result is some of the most tender beef you’ll ever enjoy.

How does buying beef through Crowd Cow work?


First off, you won't be charged anything unless we raise enough money and the cow "tips." At that point, your credit card will be charged and we'll handle the rest.
The meat is dry-aged for approximately 14 days to enhance tenderness and flavor, then processed into steaks, roasts and ground beef. 
Next, your cuts are  individually packaged in single-serving sizes and flash frozen. In fact, our steaks are vacuum-sealed in sous vide-ready pouches.
Finally, we deliver to your door for a flat fee, no matter how many shares you buy.

Our steaks come in vacuum-sealed, sous vide-ready packaging.



Buy Your Share




How much space in my freezer?


You won't need to buy a new freezer to purchase through Crowd Cow. 

Our shares include 6 to 9 pounds of beef -- enough for a large dinner party. A typical family of four will go through this in about a month.
Our standard steak share is a little bigger than a gallon of milk. Even your freezer -- packed with frozen pizzas and forgotten leftovers -- can squeeze that in.
A typical refrigerator's freezer compartment has a total capacity that could pack between 100 to 150 lbs of meat.

Our Mission


Crowd Cow brings you the very best meat, from the happiest cows, at an affordable price. 
We believe you should know where your meat is coming from. We want people to enjoy healthy, delicious beef while honoring the animals and ranchers that make it possible.
By connecting consumers directly with small, independent farms, everyone wins.

Crowd Cow Sends Grass-Fed Beef Directly to Your Door

            Where's the beef? On the internet, of course.

        






Over the past twenty years, how and where we buy our meat has become a political statement. Are you shopping at the local grocery store or a mega-sized wholesaler? Do you visit an actual butcher? What are the precise meanings of organic, grass-fed, free range and the other qualifiers you’ll see under the glass of the butcher’s counter? There are a lot of factors to consider, but for those looking to purchase high-quality and humanely raised beef, there’s now a very transparent and convenient option, Crowd Cow.

brightcove-video:5228591236001

 

 




 

The Seattle-based startup, founded in 2016, works with local Washington farms to source whole cows that are then available for sale on their website on a cut-by-cut basis. Each customer purchases shares of a cow, and in doing so becomes a “steakholder.” Then, once enough shares of a specific cow are purchased, the cow “tips,” and the sale comes to a close. After the cow tips, steakholders then receive their beef within a week or so.

While Crowd Cow is aimed at solving a problem for consumers, it's not just customers that are benefitting. Crowd Cow also empowers their farmers by removing any flash or superfluous branding from what consumers receive in the mail, so the focus is squarely on the product. As Scott Meyers, a Lopez Island farmer who uses Crowd Cow to sell the Wagyu beef that he produces on his Washington ranch, says, “They’re transparent — they sell our product as our product.”
Crowd Cow currently delivers overnight to the West Coast and Southwest, but as demand increases, the company plans to expand to the East Coast as well. Although Crowd Cow isn’t the first company to offer straight-from-the-farm beef, they are aiming to simplify the market and reduce the costs for both producers and consumers, two steps that could take Crowd Cow's philosophy from the food culture fringes into the mainstream.

—
Matthew S.
from Bainbridge Island, Washington


11 orders from Step By Step, Forest, Engle, Harlow, and Kagoshima






"The meat is the best I have had for a long time.  I thought my disappointment with beef flavor in general over the last decade+ was related to my aging taste buds.  You have proven that was not the case.  My daughter and her husband ordered from your last cow and feel the same way."

—
Nat B.
from Seattle, Washington


3 orders from Step By Step and Engle






"We wanted to share with you we LOVED the first two steaks we had and the ground beef!! We have bought half and quarter cows with groups of friends-seemed ok but never knew if it was going to be good.  One time got stuck with a whole quarter and the meat was not tasty.  I love that this way we can get just enough for a few weeks then buy more if needed.  We try to only buy grass fed and finished/organic beef from our local shop-gets spendy. Your prices are fair and it saves me a trip to store. You guys ROCK."



—
Karilyn H.
from Vashon, Washington


5 orders from Step By Step and Forest






"The website rocks, first time I've ordered from Crowd Cow and you guys nailed the checkout experience!!! Also, such a great deal. Just over $100 bucks for beef I'd normally pay around $200 for at Whole Paychex."



—
Mark M.
from Duvall, Washington


1 order from Engle






"The Kalbi ribs – OMG! Amazing flavor and texture. I made a simple marinade of soy, fresh ginger, garlic and red pepper flakes – then just let the meat marinate while the grill heated up. I actually cooked the ribs about 2-3 minutes on each side - they were still pretty rare. Delicious. Heavenly. Other worldly."



—
Laurie B.
from Bainbridge Island, Washington


8 orders from Harlow, Sweet Grass, Forest, Magnolia, Engle, and Step By Step






"Had my first burger from you guys. Pardon my french, but Holy **** it was good. We are looking to buy all our meat from you guys from here forward."



—
Chris M.
from Edmonds, Washington


2 orders from Step By Step and Hat Creek






"Yup. We did it again. More amazing beef from local farms through Crowd Cow. After having two burgers from these local farms, I dare say there is little to no chance of a burger coming close to this taste from a restaurant. We have permanently cursed our burger taste buds to eating at home, and I'm okay with that."



—
Mark H.
from Mountlake Terrace, Washington


10 orders from Step By Step, Harlow, Engle, and Colvin






"The steaks are incredible.  The tenderloins were melt in your mouth delicious!!"

—
Rhys N.
from Seattle, Washington


1 order from Step By Step






"As an avid animal lover, I have found it very hard to buy meat over the past couple of years due to the fact that I have a real problem with the inhumane ways that the animals have been raised.  So much of the meat in the stores these days is diseased due to those circumstances.  Thank you for coming up with a way to buy healthy beef, and feel ok doing so.  I'm sure there are many others out there who have the same issues that I do. You guys are great!"



—
Stacy W.
from Wenatchee, Washington


7 orders from Harlow, Forest, Step By Step, and Sweet Grass






"Absolutely love your beef... I was raised on a cattle ranch part of my life and raised cattle for our own beef until we got older and retired(moved to town) and this is by far the best beef I have had in many years"



—
Georgia M.
from The Dalles, Oregon


10 orders from Step By Step, Forest, and Harlow






"We received our first order recently. The process was so easy, and the notifications were excellent. Best of all, the beef was AMAZING in quality and taste. We will definitely be ordering more in the future. Thank you!"



—
Robin N.
from San Mateo, California


10 orders from Harlow, Engle, Sweet Grass, Step By Step, and Magnolia






"Your ground beef is SUPERIOR. I have not had such tasty ground beef since I was a teenager (50+years ago). At that time the ground beef that was purchased for my home came from a high-end specialty butcher shop that provided beef for the finer hotels in the resort area where I grew up."



—
Amy T.
from Seattle, Washington


1 order from Lil Ponderosa






"I just wanted to say that I cooked up a batch of beef shanks last weekend - osso bucco style - and it was melt in your mouth good."



—
Bill H.
from Olympia, Washington


4 orders from Harlow and Step By Step






"I just wanted to let you know I made the steak last night for dinner oh oh my gosh that steak turned out to be the best steak we have had in many many years. Since we quit buying the cow because we moved to Lincoln City and now we found you guys I think I found my meat again. I have missed the taste of having fresh meat that is homegrown without steroids. This is awesome. I definitely will come back and I definitely will let everybody I know about Crowd Cow -- the best place ever. Thank you so much for offering this to me and to others!"



—
Connieand Danny B.
from Lincoln City, Oregon


2 orders from Step By Step and Engle






"I would like to take this chance to thank you, for solving a problem that I've been struggling with. I have desperately wanted to find a way to have the quality meat that my family deserves and have been unable to achieve that goal, until now! Many thanks to you and yours - from me and mine."



—
Nina W.
from Vancouver, Washington

—
Dee P.
from Olympia, Washington


11 orders from Harlow, Step By Step, Magnolia, Engle, Gebbers, Hat Creek, and Hutterian






"We made burgers from Crowd Cow's grass fed beef last night and it was scrumptious, so juicy, tender and flavorful. The only thing we can adequately compare it to is the Hida beef skewers we had on the streets of Takayama, Japan."



—
I Wei F.
from Seattle, Washington


4 orders from Forest, Step By Step, and Magnolia






"Thanks for using high-quality tees instead of the standard Gildan for these. I love mine."

from Seattle, Washington


7 orders from Harlow, Step By Step, Sweet Grass, and Gebbers

—
Terri M.
from Yacolt, Washington


13 orders from Step By Step, Forest, Harlow, Engle, and Magnolia

—
James D.
from Bellingham, Washington


24 orders from Step By Step, Forest, Harlow, Sweet Grass, Krain, Engle, Magnolia, Gebbers, and Hat Creek






"We cooked up some burgers and they were absolutely the best I have had in years. The meat was tender, juicy and very tasty. I put very little seasoning on the meat (no salt) and YUM! I must admit, I was a little skeptical about the ground meat when I initially placed my order but so far I am very pleased. Can’t wait to try the rest of the cuts."



—
Beatrice K.
from Federal Way, Washington


2 orders from Step By Step and Harlow






"The texture is so much better and the taste is amazing. I'm really picky when it comes to buying meat and typically only buy it from either PCC or the Central Market. I hate to say this as much as I love my PCC but wow there is no comparison! I'm hooked!"



—
Marianna D.
from Bothell, Washington


13 orders from Step By Step, Harlow, Sweet Grass, Engle, and Magnolia






"These hamburgers are so incredibly good! Each bite tastes like steak. I cooked a couple of patties last night, then braised kale in the pan drippings...amazing. I can't say enough about this beef!"



—
Jan P.
from Everett, WA





"I just have to say, I've been making goulash at least once a month for my kids whole life. The last 2 times I made it he said it was SO GOOD. The only difference was the hamburger and it really IS clearly better tasting because of your hamburger meat! I love the steaks and roasts but the hamburger is what has me coming back."



—
Seann L.
from Huntington Beach, California


7 orders from Step By Step, Engle, Magnolia, and Gebbers






"I loathe and despise factory farming---how do people sleep at night? Thanks for connecting farmers and consumers. I love this idea."



—

"I must thank you for this service. I have severe allergies that require my food not consume corn, and so far, this has been some of the "safest" beef I've ever consumed. No allergic reactions whatsoever, plus I get the bonus of knowing I'm making a wonderfully nutritious, healthy meal for my friends for our little Sunday Wind-down dinners. (My Sunday crowd is immensely grateful for Crowd Cow, too.)"

"We're gonna need a bigger freezer.... just got our Steakhouse Classics pack, and New York Steak mix today from Crowd Cow. We had Chuck Eye steaks last week, and DANG if those weren't the bomb. The Chuck Eye might be the 'runt' of the Rib Eye steaks, but you wouldn't know if from these cuts... Also got more hamburger patties since those are to DIE for!! Can't WAIT to try those Rib Steaks and the Tenderloin. The Chuck Eyes we had would rival some Tenderloins I've had, so THESE tenderloins have GOT to be good...."

"Really glad Crowd Cow exists! I've told quite a few people about your company and they are all excited for you. I hope that ultimately it reduces food waste and supports farms dedicated to healthy, happy cows. That why I'm buying. I've learned a lot about beef from you folks so far. Keep the information coming, it's helps me make informed decisions."

"Our experience, as CrowdCow customers for almost a year, has been mouth watering AWESOME – with both the product and customer service.  As owners of a local gym here in Seattle, our time is very limited which means grocery shopping has to be quick and efficient.  We love to cook at home but find it hard to get quality meats from our local grocery store.  Crowd Cow has provided us the solution for finding nutritious, high quality beef at competitive prices.  They have saved us time (hooray!) because they pack for easy prep and ship directly, with zero hassles, to our doorstep.  What's even cooler is that you guys are a local company and we love supporting small businesses in our area. Thank you for EVERYTHING!"

"Wonderful product!  Have ordered from you a couple of times (Step By Step Farm) and love it.  The great experience starts as soon as I start prepping - it feels completely different than what you get at the supermarket, preps better and tastes better. Add it's better for you and that's just super awesome."
