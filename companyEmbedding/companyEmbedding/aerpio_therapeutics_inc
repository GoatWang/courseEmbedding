AKB-4924 Summary
AKB-4924 is a small molecule that stabilizes hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). HIF-1α is critical for the regulation of innate immune responses and maintenance of epithelial barrier function in the gastrointestinal tract. We are developing AKB-4924 as a once-daily, orally-administered treatment option for inflammatory bowel disease. 



How AKB-4924 Works
The response to hypoxia (reduced oxygen) is a critical mechanism by which cells regulate metabolism, immune function, and many other adaptive responses. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is the primary transcriptional regulator of this response. Amongst its many properties, HIF-1α is a critical regulator of epithelial barrier function and the innate immune response. Stabilization of HIF-1α has been shown to dramatically improve wound healing and immune response in the gut. AKB-4924 is a novel small molecule that stabilizes cellular levels of HIF-1α by inhibiting prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, the primary enzymes responsible for the destruction of HIF-1α.


Indications
AKB-4924 is being developed for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It has shown outstanding efficacy for induction and maintenance in multiple models of inflammatory bowel disease. By stabilizing HIF-1α, AKB-4924 greatly reduces the severity of colitis as measured by reduction in clinical symptoms, restoration of colon length, and preservation of the barrier function. Our Phase 1b trial will treat patients with ulcerative colitis.

Aerpio Therapeutics Inc. has named a new chief medical officer.
The biopharmaceutical company focused on eye treatments has named Dr. Steve Pakola to the newly created role.

Pakola will lead the advancement of Aerpio’s development pipeline and report to president and CEO Joseph Gardner, effective immediately.
“Steve brings 20 years of drug development experience, including over 15 years dedicated to the design and oversight of ophthalmology programs,” Gardner said in a statement. “His expertise will be invaluable as we continue to advance our lead candidate AKB-9778 in Phase 2 along with the rest of our ophthalmology platform.”
AKB-9778 is a small molecule activator used to treat diabetic macular edema. It will also be used to advance another activator, called AKB-4924, into clinical development for inflammatory bowel disease.
Pakola was most recently chief medical officer at Amakem, a company that develops new treatment for serious eye conditions. He was previously chief medical officer at ThromboGenics NV, where he was the lead inventor and developer of the company’s main product. His other previous roles include senior-level clinical development positions at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc., Quintiles and Organon Inc. He received his bachelor’s in biology and his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania.
Blue Ash-based Aerpio was spun off from Cincinnati-born Akebia Therapeutics in December 2011 before its parent company launched its initial public offering and moved to Cambridge, Mass.

Aerpio Therapeutics Initiates Phase 1a Study of AKB-4924, a First in Class Once-Daily, Orally Administered HIF-1 Stabilizer, in Development to Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) | Business Wire
























































Aerpio Therapeutics Initiates Phase 1a Study of AKB-4924, a First in 
      Class Once-Daily, Orally Administered HIF-1 Stabilizer, in Development 
      to Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD)





In preclinical studies, AKB-4924 has demonstrated efficacy in 
        multiple models of IBD


Aerpio’s Phase 1a trial in healthy volunteers will assess safety 
        and tolerability of AKB-4924 with preliminary results expected in Q4 
        2016







September 26, 2016 09:45 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CINCINNATI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aerpio Therapeutics, Inc., today announced that it has dosed the first 
      subject in a Phase 1a clinical trial evaluating its product candidate 
      AKB-4924 for the treatment of IBD. This novel, orally administered agent 
      that stabilizes hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α), a cellular 
      protein which plays a crucial role in the resolution of inflammation and 
      maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity. In multiple in vivo 
      preclinical models of IBD, AKB-4924 has been shown to markedly reduce 
      disease activity, with decreased levels of inflammation and preservation 
      of mucosal integrity. AKB-4924 also led to marked reductions in multiple 
      inflammatory cytokines in plasma and colon tissue.
    


      “Initiating the clinical development program for AKB-4924 represents a 
      major milestone,” commented Kevin Peters, M.D., Aerpio’s Chief 
      Scientific Officer. “AKB-4924 has the potential to be the first orally 
      administered agent to target both the resolution of inflammation and the 
      restoration of epithelial barrier function, the two major drivers of IBD 
      pathogenesis.”
    

      Joseph Gardner, Aerpio’s CEO stated, “Currently, patients with moderate 
      to severe IBD are treated with steroids or biologics, both of which have 
      significant side effects. We believe that AKB-4924 provides a 
      groundbreaking treatment for IBD that could reduce the dependence of IBD 
      patients on both steroids and biologics.”
    

About the AKB-4924 Study


      Aerpio’s Phase 1a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is 
      designed to enroll up to 48 healthy volunteers. Twelve individuals will 
      receive placebo and 36 will receive AKB-4924 in up to six dose cohorts 
      in an ascending-dose design. The study’s primary objective is to assess 
      the safety and tolerability of a single oral dose of AKB-4924. The study 
      will also assess pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AKB-4924.
    

About AKB-4924


      AKB-4924 is a small molecule, HIF-1α stabilizing agent. HIF-1α is 
      critical for the regulation of innate immune responses and maintenance 
      of epithelial barrier function, particularly in the gut. AKB-4924 is 
      being developed as a once-daily, orally-administered therapy for IBD.
    

About Aerpio Therapeutics


      Aerpio Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company 
      focused on the development of novel therapeutics based on two 
      mechanisms, Tie2 activation for vascular disorders with a concentration 
      on diseases of the eye and the stabilization of HIF‐1α for the treatment 
      of IBD. The Company’s lead program, AKB‐9778, is a first‐in‐class small 
      molecule stabilizer of the Tie2 pathway and is in clinical development 
      for diabetic eye disease. Aerpio has also commenced clinical testing of 
      AKB- 4924, a HIF-1 stabilizer, for the treatment of IBD. More

Aerpio Therapeutics Inc. has named a new chief medical officer.
The biopharmaceutical company focused on eye treatments has named Dr. Steve Pakola to the newly created role.

Pakola will lead the advancement of Aerpio’s development pipeline and report to president and CEO Joseph Gardner, effective immediately.
“Steve brings 20 years of drug development experience, including over 15 years dedicated to the design and oversight of ophthalmology programs,” Gardner said in a statement. “His expertise will be invaluable as we continue to advance our lead candidate AKB-9778 in Phase 2 along with the rest of our ophthalmology platform.”
AKB-9778 is a small molecule activator used to treat diabetic macular edema. It will also be used to advance another activator, called AKB-4924, into clinical development for inflammatory bowel disease.
Pakola was most recently chief medical officer at Amakem, a company that develops new treatment for serious eye conditions. He was previously chief medical officer at ThromboGenics NV, where he was the lead inventor and developer of the company’s main product. His other previous roles include senior-level clinical development positions at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc., Quintiles and Organon Inc. He received his bachelor’s in biology and his medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania.
Blue Ash-based Aerpio was spun off from Cincinnati-born Akebia Therapeutics in December 2011 before its parent company launched its initial public offering and moved to Cambridge, Mass.

(the “Company”), a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing first-in-class treatments for ocular diseases, today announced the successful completion of its reverse merger transaction with Aerpio Therapeutics, Inc. (“Aerpio”) and Aerpio Acquisition Corp. (“Merger Sub”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Following the reverse merger transaction, the Company will continue the historical business of Aerpio.The reverse merger transaction closed on March 15, 2017, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into Aerpio, with Aerpio continuing as the surviving corporation. All outstanding capital stock of Aerpio was converted into shares of the Company’s common stock, and all outstanding options to purchase common stock of Aerpio have been converted into options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock.The Company also announced today the consummation of a private placement for gross proceeds of approximately $40.0 million for the issuance of an estimated 8.0 million shares of common stock at a purchase price of $5.00 per share. Net proceeds from the transaction will be used for clinical development activities, including advancement of Aerpio’s lead program, AKB-9778, for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy (DR).Current investors of Aerpio participated in the offering, including Novartis Venture Fund, OrbiMed, Satter Investment Management, Kearny Venture Partners, Venture Investors, LLC., and Triathlon Medical Ventures. New institutional investors, Montrose Capital Partners and Ally-Bridge, also participated in the offering. Raymond James & Associates, Inc., National Securities Corporation, and Katalyst Securities LLC acted as placement agents in the offering.Following the completion of the reverse merger transaction and subsequent financing, the Company’s Board of Directors is comprised of eight members. Previous members of Aerpio’s board of directors, including, Muneer Satter (Chairman), Joseph Gardner, Ph.D., Chau Khuong Ph.D., Anupam Dalal, M.D., and Paul Weiss, Ph.D., will remain on as Directors of the Company. In addition, Caley Castelein, M.D., Pravin Dugel, M.D., and Steven Prelack have joined the Company as Directors.“Tie2 has steadily gained momentum as one of the most scientifically validated pathways for stabilizing vasculature and now stands at the forefront of new mechanisms being studied to treat retinal disease,” noted Joseph Gardner, President & CEO. “The potential of AKB-9778 for patients with DR is significant. Reversing the progression of diabetic eye disease, without repeated injections into the eye, could positively impact the lives of millions of people. The hard work and commitment of our team over the last year, in conjunction with this financing, will allow us to initiate our next study and bring us one step closer to realizing this vision.”“The focus on DR provides a unique opportunity to transform the way diabetic eye disease is treated across the globe,” noted Dr. Pravin Dugel, a preeminent retina specialist and one of the Company’s newly elected Directors. “I’m excited to have the opportunity to be on the Aerpio team and proud to work on a potentially game-changing therapy for patients with no current treatment options.”In the second quarter of 2017, the Company plans to initiate a 150 patient, double-masked, placebo-controlled, Phase 2b trial of once- and twice-daily dosing of AKB-9778 for 12 months to evaluate the safety and efficacy of AKB-9778 in subjects with moderate to severe DR without diabetic macular edema.The offering was exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act and Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated by the SEC thereunder. The Common Stock in the offering was sold to “accredited investors,” as defined in Regulation D, and was conducted on a “reasonable best efforts” basis.This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities, nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.About Aerpio PharmaceuticalsRead MoreAerpio Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing first-in-class treatments for ocular diseases. The Company’s lead program, AKB‐9778, is a small molecule activator of the Tie2 pathway and is in clinical development for diabetic retinopathy.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements. Statements in this press release that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements include, among other things, the Company’s anticipated uses of proceeds from the private placement, business and product development plans and market information, including the timeline of, and other developmental plans for, AKB-9778 for diabetic retinopathy or otherwise, and the therapeutic potential of the Company’s product candidates, including AKB-9778. Actual results could differ from those projected in any forward-looking statements due to several risk factors. Such factors include, among others, the ability to raise the additional funding needed to continue to develop AKB-9778 or other product development plans, the inherent uncertainties associated with the FDA and drug development process, competition in the industry in which the Company operates and overall market conditions. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this press release, and the Company assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Investors should consult all the information set forth herein and should also refer to the risk factor disclosure set forth in the reports and other documents the Company files with the SEC available at www.sec.gov.View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170316005411/en/ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill Cabot (COG) Disappoint Investors this Earnings Season?ZacksEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredFacebook Inc (FB) Stock Should Hit $180 After Q2 EarningsInvestorPlaceIowa firm tied to truck deaths has history of legal problemsAssociated PressEarnings set to dominate on Wall Street as Alphabet, Hasbro reportCNBCA Penny-Crypto Miracle Making Some Americans RichAgora FinancialSponsoredJ.
