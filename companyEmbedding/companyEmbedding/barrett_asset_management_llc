Enhancing Our Clients’ Wealth For This Generation And The Next
 





Customized Investment Management Since 1937
For 75 years, we have helped high-net-worth individuals, families and institutions cultivate their wealth through long-term client relationships that are the hallmark of our firm.
We have successfully managed our clients' assets through many economic cycles and from one generation to the next since our founding in 1937.
Barrett managers are experienced, dedicated investment professionals with a solid understanding of financial markets and investing. What sets us apart, however, is our ability to solve the specific challenges that face our clients.  We value the importance of each client and look forward to building lasting relationships.

 

Client Oriented Objective Investment Counsel
We offer each client an unbiased decision making process, full fiduciary responsibility, and the support of our entire firm.
Our decisions are guided by the highest ethical and professional standards, providing each client with a responsive relationship based on personal knowledge, trust and investment expertise.

 

Independence
Barrett Asset Management is independently owned and managed by the principals of the firm solely for the purpose of offering investment management services. We are free from the numerous conflicts of interest inherent in many larger organizations.
Our collegial culture coupled with the spirit, camaraderie and character of our organization means that we enjoy working with one another just as we enjoy working with our clients.
The quality, integrity and independence of our advice, coupled with our unwavering commitment to client service, differentiate us from the competition.
