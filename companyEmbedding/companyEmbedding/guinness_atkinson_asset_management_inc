Q.  How do I invest in the Guinness Atkinson Funds?
A:  You can invest either through your broker or, if you prefer, you can invest directly with us.  To invest direct, you’ll need to complete the new account form and send your check to the Funds’ transfer agent, U.S. Bancorp Fund Services.  For more information on investing direct please see the Invest With Us Page.
Q.  Can I fund my account with a wire instead of a check?
A.  Yes.  The new account application form has instructions on how to establish your account and fund it by wire.
Q.  Do you offer systematic withdrawals?
A.  Yes.  Please call our customer service team for information on how to establish this feature. Call 1.800.915.6566 Monday to Friday 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Central Time
Q. Can I make regular investments into the Funds?
A.  Yes, we offer a systematic investment plan.  You can invest on a regular basis (monthly or quarterly at your option).  Once established the investment amount you choose is automatically invested with the funds coming direct from your bank account.  An automatic investment plan can be a great way to help build your account over time. The form to initiate the automatic investment plan is contained in the new account application.  If you need help on this please feel free to call our customer service team at 800 915-6566. Note that this feature is not available for the Renmimbi Yuan & Bond Fund.
Q. What if I need to make a change to my account?
A.  Our customer service team is standing by to assist you.  Please give them a call at 800 915-6566.  We are not able to process account changes or transactions via email but our team is more than willing to help you with whatever need you may have.
Q.  What do I do if I need to make a redemption?
A.  Most shareholders have telephone redemption privileges.  A call to our customer service team at 800 915-6566 is the easiest way to initiate a redemption.  If you have not signed up for telephone redemption our customer service team will walk you through the necessary steps to process a redemption.
Q.  Do you offer a money market fund?
A. A money market fund is available for exchange purposes, meaning if you wish to move to a cash investment we have one available. Please call our customer service team at 800 915-6566 for more information or to make an exchange.
Q. Can you tell me about expectations for year-end dividends? I’d like to do some year-end tax planning.
A.  We typically post year-end distribution estimates in October or November and then update these estimates if necessary as the year draws to a close.  Please note that these estimates are subject to change and the final dividend distributions may vary from the estimates.  The final dividend amounts are posted a few days before year-end.  Information on quarterly and year-end dividends is available here.
Q.  Do you offer electronic statements?
A.  At the moment, no.  We are planning to initiate electronic delivery of statements at some point in the future.
Q. Where can I find performance information on the Guinness Atkinson Funds?
A. The Our Funds page has up to date performance including total returns and Morningstar Ratings.
Q.  Are the Guinness Atkinson Funds considered load or no-load?
A.  All of the Guinness Atkinson Funds are no-load, which means there is no commission or charge to purchase the Guinness Atkinson Funds.  This does not mean that there are no management fees or other expenses.  Some brokers may charge a transaction fee for some of the Guinness Atkinson Funds.  Also, there is a short-term redemption fee of 2% for shares held for 30 days or less.
Q.  Why is there a redemption fee?
A.  The Guinness Atkinson Funds are meant for long-term investors. The redemption fee (2% for 30 days) is meant to both discourage active trading in the Guinness Atkinson Funds and to compensate the remaining investors for activity based charges incurred by the Fund.
Q.  What do you mean by human progress? And why is it important to investing?
A.  We believe that it is difficult to invest successfully without a view regarding the direction we are heading, and by “we,” we mean the entire world. There are a handful of very important long-term secular trends underway that are quite clearly reshaping the planet.  These changes have political, social, cultural, economic and, importantly for us, investment implications.  The breakneck speed of business and innovation, the dramatic and stunning rise of China and Asia, the increasing demands for energy on a global scale and the inexorable shift to alternative energy are just some of the forces that are profoundly reshaping the world around us. We’re not sure how—or why—one would invest without thinking about these broad themes and factoring the implications of this change into their thinking.
Further, while we understand that rapid change can be unsettling, the hidden truth in these changes is that the human condition continues to improve. Yes, we know the news media sometimes offers a steady drumbeat of negative news and we acknowledge that there are some very serious issues confronting us.  We also acknowledge that for a large portion of the world life is nothing short of terrible. We’ve always had serious problems to tackle and there has always been a large portion of the world for which life is extreme.  Yet despite the negative drumbeat the human condition continues to improve.  How do we know? Almost any measure of the human condition is on an upward arc.  Infant mortality rates, life expectancy, leisure time, per capita GDP, literacy, access to education, information and health care and a host of other key metrics have never been as high as now.  Quite frankly, there has never been a better time to be a human.
Q.  How do you keep investors up to date?
A.  In addition to this website we offer an email program featuring a series of monthly eBriefs produced by our asset management team.  We offer the following eBriefs: Energy Brief, Asia Brief, Alternative Energy Brief and the Dividend Brief.  These eBriefs are designed to provide our most current thinking about the broad themes as well as the current outlook and update on the holdings within the Funds.  We maintain an archive of these eBriefs so that readers can see what we were thinking in the past.  Whether you’re an investor in our Funds or just interested in our views on these themes you’re encouraged to sign up to receive the eBriefs of your choice.  We also offer a daily or weekly (Friday) email with the day’s prices.
Q.  If I sign up for these eBriefs will you start sending me a bunch of email?
A.  No.  Each eBrief subscription will mean approximately one email per month.  We generally send one or two additional emails per year.  And, of course, we don’t share our email list with anyone.
Q.  What if I have a question that isn’t covered here?
A.  Feel free to send an email to [email protected] We like hearing from investors and welcome the opportunity to address any inquiries.
Q.  I see you have an alternative energy fund.  Who do I speak with if I have an alternative energy project that needs funding?
A.  The Guinness Atkinson Funds invest in publicly traded companies.  We are not in a position to provide funding for projects, startups or other non-publicly traded investment vehicles. If your company is a publicly traded alternative energy company then it is almost certainly already known to our investment management team.  If it is a project or venture capital idea then we are not able to consider it.

Fully one-third of the world lives in Asia, and close to a billion Asians have risen from poverty to middle class status, making them a consumer market as well as a manufacturing hub for the developed world. Rapid industrialization and economic reform have helped China become the world’s second largest economy, surpassing Japan now in third place and India in fourth place. We think that Asia’s remarkable economic growth has been and will continue to be an engine for the global economy over the next 50 years. Our Asia Focus Fund lets you participate in this unprecedented growth by investing in dynamic companies located in China, Hong Kong, India, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and more.

Current performance of the Funds may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Total returns reflect a fee waiver in effect and in the absence of this waiver, the total returns would be lower. Performance data does not reflect the 2% redemption fee for shares held less than 30 days and if deducted the fee would reduce the performance quoted.

Edmund Harriss
Investment Director, Fund Manager















Having managed the Asia Funds for over 14 years both from London and from Hong Kong, Edmund Harriss is dedicated to understanding the agents of change. It’s about making ourselves ready for the new world that is unfolding in front of our eyes. For Edmund there is nothing quite like studying companies and making the right investment call. He welcomes the sense of responsibility to all the people invested in his funds. He embraces that trust that has been placed in him, relishes the challenge, and enjoys nothing more than to deliver on those hopes.
In the process of translating grand transformational themes into a stock portfolio, Edmund seeks to understand businesses and to forecast a range of outcomes before making a final investment decision.
Trend not to be overlooked: Demographic change. The populations of the developed world are getting older while the developing economies are now the source of new workers. This trend presages a major shift in the balance of economic power in the world.

Innovation 
 
In today’s hypercompetitive  environment and ever-changing business cycles, we think innovation is a prerequisite for success. Innovation is not just an idea; it is a way of doing business. We think companies that consistently innovate are more likely to be market leaders and that they have the potential to produce superior returns.

Why Innovation? 

The implications of technology, globalism, and communications have forever changed the world of business. While the fit may survive, it’s the innovative that thrive. Companies must relentlessly question all assumptions related to their business operations.
Innovation is often associated with technology, but it’s much more than the latest software or electronic gadget. Business innovations can be found in better ways of doing almost anything: product development, supply chain management, marketing and sales, process efficiency or a host of other competitive advantages. Innovation helps companies overcome the forces of competition and attain longevity, even during times of inflation.
We believe innovation is the theme that will dominate the western world in our current century as it continues to take hold in the developing world. At Guinness Atkinson Funds, we’re optimistic about opportunities available in companies that create value through original thinking, imagination and thinking one step ahead of the rest of the world and we aim to do the same

Dividends 
 
The only thing we like better than dividends is growing dividends. The fact that dividends have the ability to grow over time is an important benefit to investors seeking to keep pace with inflation and can be a key to enhancing the quality of life.  Our dividend strategy explicitly seeks a rising dividend stream over time.

Dividends are a key component to long term total returns. From 1940 to 2010 90% of the total return of the S&P 500 was from dividends. One of the benefits of dividends is that they have the ability to grow over time which can help offset the effects of inflation and low or rising interest rate environment. And who doesn’t appreciate a growing income stream?
Because we’re explicitly aiming for dividend growth, we focus on high quality companies. The idea of investing in high quality companies sounds nice (who doesn’t want high quality companies in their portfolio?), but it isn’t just a vague concept or slogan. We have developed an investment methodology that rigorously, even ruthlessly, identifies high quality companies. To us, high quality means companies that have demonstrated a long-term consistent ability to generate high levels of cash flow. It is this demonstrated ability to generate relatively high levels of cash that allows companies to grow their dividend over time. And, as we’ve said, the only thing we like better than dividends are growing dividends.

“I can’t help thinking that we are lucky to live in the 21st century.“




Jim Atkinson
Chief Executive Officer















As you might deduce from the above quote, Jim is one of those annoyingly optimistic fellows who can’t wait to get out of the bed in the morning. He can often be heard saying things like, “Living standards have increased to the point that even the poorest in the industrialized world today have more than the King of England in 1500.” This is just one of the fun ‘Jim facts’ that fill our days. And while he never tires of gushing about this being his “dream job,” we should mention that, according to Jim, if he couldn’t do this he’d be a tugboat operator. He does not elaborate on that point.
Having spent more than 30 years in the world of finance and management, Jim exhibits a level of passion and motivation that we can only describe as “Jim Atkinson-like.” His level of expertise is rivaled only by his drive to expand his understanding of the global community. We estimate that he will tire of this as soon as he knows everything there is to know in the universe.
As a Founder of Guinness Atkinson Funds, Jim has been instrumental in developing the company’s philosophy and in identifying the core fund themes of human progress and profound change. For Jim, there’s never been a better time to be a human being, and this attitude shines through in everything he does. Even very early in the morning, before we’ve had caffeine.
Trend not to be overlooked: We can’t afford to miss the potential dominance of Asia and China.



Quick Stats
Jim Atkinson serves as the CEO and Chief Compliance Officer of Guinness Atkinson Asset Management, Inc., and the president of Guinness Atkinson Funds.
From 1993 to 2000, Jim was the managing director of Guinness Flight Global Asset Management, Ltd. (which merged with Investec in 1998).
Prior to 1993, he was a senior vice president of Huntington Advisers, a mutual fund manager specializing in foreign currency money funds.
In addition, Jim has served as the president of Max Funds and as the Principal at a mutual fund marketing research and consultancy firm.
Jim graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles with a degree in History and emphasis in History of Science & Technology. When not immersing himself in study, he served as President of the UCLA Debate Team.







“Progress is exciting— it’s an opportunity to meet new and complex challenges. And every Guinness Atkinson Fund presents an opportunity to invest in progress.“




Tim Guinness
Chief Investment Officer, Fund Manager















As a Founder and the Chief Investment Officer of Guinness Atkinson Funds, Tim Guinness is a logic-based value investor with nearly 40 years of experience. He believes in hard work and discipline, subjecting stocks to a gauntlet of due diligence. His investment strategy, a draw not only for investors but also for those joining his team, involves a combination of crunching the numbers into a fine powder, constantly reviewing sectors and sub-sectors for profitability and growth potential, and staying sharply focused on the themes of global transformation and profound change.
Tim’s investment strategy also involves riding his bicycle to work in the morning – demonstrating a passion for life that equals his love for numbers. In fact, he founded the company on the basic principal that investment opportunities could be enhanced by focusing on specific global themes that are changing our lives today and will continue to do so long into the future. Tim and co-founder Jim Atkinson have an ongoing contest to see who can generate the most enthusiasm. Soon they will have to take out warehouse space to store it all.
Trend not to be overlooked: Energy demand growth in the developing world, which will likely be met by both traditional sources, like oil and gas, and renewable sources, like wind and solar.

Quick Stats
Tim Guinness has served as Guinness Atkinson’s Chairman and Chief Investment Officer since the firm’s founding in November 2002.
From 1999 to November 2002, he was Joint Chairman of Guinness Flight Global Asset Management, Ltd., and was the CEO from 1997 to 1999. While at Guinness Flight (which ultimately merged with Investec in 1998), Tim was a founding portfolio manager of the Global Equity Fund, which was established in 1985.
Tim graduated from Cambridge University with a degree in engineering. He then completed a Master’s Degree in Management Science at the Sloan School M.I.T. in the United States.







“It may sound like a cliché to refer to the “Asian Miracle” but I believe that the economic growth that has occurred in Asia throughout the last 30 years represents the greatest increase in the human condition for more people than any other event in human history.“




Edmund Harriss
Investment Director, Fund Manager















Having managed the Asia Funds for over 14 years both from London and from Hong Kong, Edmund Harriss is dedicated to understanding the agents of change. It’s about making ourselves ready for the new world that is unfolding in front of our eyes. For Edmund there is nothing quite like studying companies and making the right investment call. He welcomes the sense of responsibility to all the people invested in his funds. He embraces that trust that has been placed in him, relishes the challenge, and enjoys nothing more than to deliver on those hopes.
In the process of translating grand transformational themes into a stock portfolio, Edmund seeks to understand businesses and to forecast a range of outcomes before making a final investment decision.
Trend not to be overlooked: Demographic change. The populations of the developed world are getting older while the developing economies are now the source of new workers. This trend presages a major shift in the balance of economic power in the world.

Edmund graduated from Christ Church, University of Oxford, with a Masters degree in Management Studies and has a Bachelors degree in History from the University of York.
He is also an Associate of the Society of Investment Professionals.







“I can see the potential for 10 to 20 years of strong growth across the renewable energy industry. Energy supply may be the most pressing issue facing the planet today.“




Edward Guinness
Fund Manager















It’s important to Edward Guinness to be part of a company that sets itself apart by thinking creatively. Edward manages our Alternative Energy Fund, which provides one of the best opportunities for the company to leverage its creative mindset.
Increase in global energy supply is essential for continued improvements to living standards throughout the world.  And with the prospect of electric vehicles, we expect electricity consumption in 20 years to be considerably higher than forecast today by the International Energy Agency, as historic demand forecasts have usually proved to be conservative.
Edward watches market trends unblinkingly, paying particular attention to new developments, resource shifts and innovations relating to alternative as well as mainstream energy. His experience and insight in identifying trends and his ability to combine forward thinking with traditional values such as hard work and discipline make him a good match for this fund.
Trend not to be overlooked: Growth in global electricity demand.

“The investment process can seem complex but in reality we're looking for companies that create wealth by enriching consumers.“




Dr. Ian Mortimer, CFA
Fund Co-Manager















Massive, overwhelming quantities of data are a welcome sight to Dr. Ian Mortimer. With a background in physics and the skills he picked up while getting his doctorate—such as logical thinking, math, and data analysis—he is able to recognize patterns and meaning where others may see only chaos and noise.  Ian uses these skills on a daily basis at Guinness Atkinson.
His passion for his investment areas (Energy, Innovation, Dividends) helps keep him in tune with what’s happening throughout the world in all areas impacting global progress. He pays strict attention to stock price fluctuations and their constant movement as he analyzes the market. Yet for as much as he looks at the numbers when researching a potential investment opportunity, he also relies on personal interactions, analyzing a company’s passion, commitment, and potential success through the attitudes and actions of their corporate management.
Trend not to be overlooked: Companies’ ability to consistently innovate, with technologies, distribution chains or process efficiencies.

“Global energy concerns are going to be absolutely central to political and social decisions that are made over the next decade.“




Will Riley
Fund Co-Lead Manager















Will Riley has a mind for finance and a passion for global energy. With over twelve years in finance and eight years of valuation analysis, his goal is to find the most attractive investments across the global energy spectrum.
While mainstream energy is clearly an issue of central importance today, Will believes that interest in the sector will increase markedly as the combination of growing demand and dwindling supply signals a continued rise in energy prices. His simple enjoyment of analysis and his enthusiasm for the market continually drive him to find lucrative opportunities. And while he can spend hours pouring over spreadsheets and analyzing data, he also thrives on the spirited debates of the Guinness Atkinson team—a cornerstone of our investment process.
Trend not to be overlooked: The breadth of growth in oil demand across the developing world, not just from China.

Fund risk factors
All the Guinness Funds are open ended, long-only equity funds. Investors should be willing and able to assume the risks of equity investing. Investment in the Funds carries with it a degree of risk and investors should read the risk factors section in the prospectus before investing. The value of the Funds’ portfolios changes daily in accordance with the movement of underlying capital markets and the specific share price movements of the companies in whose shares each Fund invests.
Past performance is not a guide to future performance.
Performance risks
We identify the following performance risks in our Funds:



 

Market risk
The value of investments and the income from them may go down as well as up and are not guaranteed. An investor may not get back the amount originally invested. The value of an investment can be affected by changes in general market conditions, other political, social and economic developments, as well as specific matters relating to the companies in whose securities each Fund invests.


Currency risk
 Changes in the rates of exchange may cause the value of investments to go up or down.
While the Funds have share classes priced in various currencies, the base currency of all the Funds is US Dollars, and the Fund valuations for all share classes are initially calculated each dealing day in US Dollars. Non-US Dollar share classes are then converted into their respective currencies from the US Dollar valuation.
The Funds invest internationally and hold all investments in local currency. Guinness Asset Management does not conduct any hedging of currency exposure on the Funds’ capital value or income. The Funds aim to be fully invested most of the time, but any cash balances are normally held in US dollars. This means that the exposure of the Funds to any one currency is mainly limited to the value of its holdings in stocks priced in that currency. Therefore, as well as the impact of share price movements in the securities each Fund holds, the capital value of an investment in a Fund will be affected by changes in exchange rates between the stocks’ local currency, the Fund’s base currency (USD) and the currency of the Fund share class you own.


Emerging market risk
The risk inherent in a Fund is higher when it is invested in markets which may be considered ’emerging’. These Funds are only suitable for those investors who are prepared to accept the above average volatility inherent in emerging market investment.




There are other risks of investing in our funds, such as credit and counterparty risks, which are detailed in the Prospectus.
Shareholders in Guinness Global Equity Income Fund and Guinness Global Money Managers Fund should note that all or part of the fees and expenses can be charged to the capital of the Funds. Charging fees and expenses to capital has the effect of lowering the capital value of your investment.
Fund specific risks
In addition some funds carry their own specific risks:






Sector risk
Some funds invest only in companies involved in a single industry or a single sector of the market. These funds are very susceptible to the performance of that one industry or sector, and can be volatile. Examples in the Guinness fund range include:

Guinness Alternative Energy Fund
Guinness Global Energy Fund
Guinness Global Money Managers Fund




Geographic risk
Some funds invest only in stocks listed in or exposed to one single country or region. These funds are very susceptible to the performance of that one country or region, and can be volatile. Examples in the Guinness fund range include:

Guinness China & Hong Kong Fund





For more detail on the risks relating to specific products, please refer to the relevant documentation for that product.
Guinness EIS Service
An Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS) is a government initiative to encourage investment in smaller, higher-risk companies by offering a range of tax reliefs to investors. EIS-qualifying companies can be unlisted smaller companies (companies whose shares are not quoted on any recognised stock exchange), or companies listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM).
The Guinness EIS Service is a discretionary managed service investing in EIS qualifying companies and managed by Guinness Asset Management Ltd, the Investment Manager. The Service comprises a range of investment themes which can be accessed by investors via a sequence of dated “offerings”. Each offering has a finite subscription period, with an opening and closing date for subscriptions. To qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an EIS investment, investors should be prepared to hold their investment for a minimum of three years. Each offering has its own Information Memorandum detailing the terms and conditions, specific risks and tax implications of investment.
The range of investment themes in the Guinness EIS Service include AIM-listed companies and Sustainable Energy companies.
An investment in the Guinness EIS Service is subject to a number of risks, both general and specific to each offering within the Service. Before making any decision to invest, prospective investors need to understand that investing in EIS-qualifying companies can be highly speculative and carries high risk. The Information Memorandum for each offering contains details of the risks involved. Investors should consider carefully whether a subscription is suitable for them in the light of the information in the Information Memorandum and their personal circumstances. Before investing, investors are strongly recommended to consult an authorised financial adviser. We recommend you seek appropriate independent advice before investing.
Past performance of the Investment Manager is no guarantee of future performance. The value of an investment in any investee company may go down as well as up and investors may not get back the full amount invested. The Investment Manager will rely on achieving an exit for the investments made in each offering in order to generate a capital gain for investors. There is no guarantee that exits will be available at the prices anticipated by the Investment Manager.
General EIS investment risks
1. Concentration risk
The Investment Manager may be unable to make sufficient investments in suitable investee companies. If sufficient investments are not made, the returns achieved by the Service could be materially impacted.
The Investment Manager intends to invest across a portfolio of investee companies to diversify exposure to any one company. However, there is a risk that the investments are concentrated or there is a weighting towards one or more sectors. In these circumstances returns to investors may be adversely affected by the underperformance of a particular company or sector.
2. Size and liquidity risk
The Guinness EIS Service invests in companies that are relatively small. Smaller investee companies can be vulnerable to government actions and changes in statute. In particular, there may be changes to the EIS legislation which may affect investors’ tax positions.
Investee companies may be reliant on the skills or knowledge of a small number of individuals, and should a key individual leave performance may be adversely affected.
Some companies’ shares in which the Investment Manager invests will be listed on AIM, other companies will be unlisted.
Listed shares
Although some companies’ shares in which the Guinness EIS Service can invest are listed on AIM, not all shares are readily realisable at all times.
Investment in shares traded on AIM involves a higher degree of risk, and such shares may be less liquid, than shares in companies which are listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. The rules governing AIM companies are less demanding than those of companies listed on the main market of the London Stock Exchange.
The market price of AIM-listed shares may not necessarily reflect their underlying value.
The share price of AIM-listed companies can be highly volatile and shareholdings can be illiquid. The price at which AIM-listed shares are quoted and the price at which such shares may realise will be influenced by a large number of factors, some specific to the relevant investee company and its operations, and others which may affect AIM-listed companies generally, such as legislative changes, and general economic, political, regulatory or social conditions.
Some AIM-listed companies are majority owned by connected parties who may be in a position to exert influence on the relevant investee company and their interests may differ from other shareholders.
Unlisted shares
Some offerings in the Guinness EIS Service can invest in companies which are not expected to have a listing or quotation. Therefore, there may not be a recognised or active market for the shares of investee companies and it may be difficult to sell or realise the investment or obtain reliable information about their value. Investors should not consider investing money in an offering which can hold shares in unlisted companies if their investment may be required during the life of the offering, which is normally at least three years.
Investors should not consider subscribing unless they can afford a total loss of their subscription.
Minority holdings in unquoted investments may be difficult to protect and difficult to realise. The timing of realisations of investments by the Service cannot therefore be predicted.
3. Tax risks
The tax reliefs referred to in the Information Memorandum for each offering in the Guinness EIS Service are those currently applicable. However, investors should be aware that tax reliefs can change. Their applicability and value will depend upon the individual circumstances of a given investor, and investors should seek their own independent professional advice on their particular tax situation and the application of such tax reliefs prior to making a subscription in the Service.
It is the intention of the Investment Manager to invest in companies which qualify under the EIS legislation, but there is no guarantee that EIS status can be maintained throughout the life of the Investment. Both investee companies and investors need to comply with the requirements of the EIS legislation in order to maintain EIS Income Tax Relief, CGT free disposal and CGT Deferral Relief, and non-compliance may result in the loss or partial claw-back of EIS Income Tax Relief and CGT Deferral Relief, and potential interest penalties. Subscription funds will not be returned in these instances; investments will be exited as deemed appropriate by the Investment Manager.
Shares in companies which qualify under the EIS legislation will normally qualify for Business Property Relief for Inheritance Tax purposes. In order to secure this relief investors must retain their shareholding in an investee company for a minimum of two years. The Investment Manager intends to invest in companies which qualify for EIS Relief, CGT Deferral Relief and Business Property Relief, although there is a possibility that investments will not qualify for one or more of these.
To qualify for the full range of tax benefits of an EIS investment, it is the intention of the Investment Manager that investments in qualifying companies will be held for three years. However, the Investment Manager reserves the right to realise individual investments before three years if it believes it is in the best interests of investors.
Specific EIS risks
Additional risks and uncertainties apply to each offering in the Service and the companies in which it invests. These specific risks may have an adverse effect on the business of the investee companies. Investors should consider carefully whether a subscription to the Service is suitable for them in the light of the information in the relevant Information Memorandum, and their personal circumstances.

Guinness Asset Management provides a range of long only actively managed funds to individual and institutional investors. Founded in 2003, Guinness is independent and is wholly owned by its employees.   



 



We believe in in-house research, intelligent screening for prioritisation of research and well-designed investment processes. We manage concentrated, high conviction portfolios, with low turnover and no benchmark constraints.

Since our establishment we have developed a variety of specialisms in global growth and dividend funds, global sector funds and Asian regional and country funds.

The Guinness equity funds sit within an Irish-listed OEIC. They are managed alongside a range of similar SEC-registered funds offered to US investors by our US sister company, Guinness Atkinson Asset Management Inc.

We also offer an Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS service) investing in Sustainable Infrastructure and an AIM EIS investing in AIM-listed companies.
