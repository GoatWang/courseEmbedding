            Very well put together, yet did leave me wanting more. Perhaps not a bad thing.

            A small but extremely powerful book.  Read this book several times over the years.  Always a new discipline to delve into and work through.  Using it now as a group Bible study.

            I found this book to be awesome as well as a quick and easy read. Because I think it's very important for us to get away from our "busyness" excuses to be intimate with our heavenly Father, I gave this book to one of my elders and suggested we do a study on it together as a church body.

            I enjoy Chuck Swindoll's books. I read the whole thing in an hour, so it was easy to stay focused on his deep thoughts of God.

            This is a book that is an easy read with huge thoughts and the ability to make you evaluate your relationship with God.  I bought 10 because I wanted to share them as gifts to people I know who care about that relationship and want to grow.
