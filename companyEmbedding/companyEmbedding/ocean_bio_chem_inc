IDS Bio-Engineered Waximaize, Natural Flavor, 5 pounds 


                        Dietary supplement. Complex carb supplement. Swells muscles. Bigger pumps. Increases blood volume. No flavors. No sweeteners. Waximaize in combination with other supplements including creatine, testosterone boosters, stimulants, N.O. products, or amino acids will dramatically increase the speed and                        
                             efficiency of absorption into the bloodstream and subsequently to muscles. Waximaize is a corn based modified starch with unique properties in the human body. While most complex carbohydrates from normal food sources remain in the stomach to be digested, broken down into shorter carbohydrate sugar chains before entering the bloodstream, Waximaize with its unusually high engineered molecular weight drops through the stomach at twice the speed! Because of this, Waximaize remains a complex or long chain carbohydrate as it enters the small intestine for absorption. In addition to this, Waximaize has a very low Osmolarity which allows it to quickly and effortlessly cross into the bloodstream intact. Stage 1. Once in the bloodstream Waximaize draws subcutaneous water (water trapped just under the skin) into the bloodstream, quickly increasing blood volume. This initial response reveals definition in muscles previously washed out by the thin film of what was previously perceived as body fat. Stage 2. This increased blood volume causes visible veins, to appear in the limbs to carry the increased blood volume to muscles. This vascularity adds to the appearance of a leaner physique. Stage 3. This increased blood volume delivers Waximaize to waiting muscles, overloading glycogen stores for an unparalleled full feeling. This glycogen loading fills muscle bellies revealing previously unseen peaks and size. Waximaize quick uptake properties will speed and improve absorption rates of other supplements like amino acids, creatines, testosterone supplements or vitamins when taken together immediately post-workout.
