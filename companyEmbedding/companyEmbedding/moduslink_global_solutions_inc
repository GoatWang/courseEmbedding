After all, by opening one door, another closes. Not making any choice, however, keeps every door closed. Read more   By Nick Foy  July 10, 2017What Retailers Can Learn from Amazon Prime DayWe’re all used to Black Friday, and (more recently) Cyber Monday, but it now looks like Prime Day is set to be another date in the shopping frenzy calendar.  Amazon’s third annual Prime Day is July 11th (though deals are already underway – check them out here!), and early projections show that it could generate as much as $1 billion in revenue for the behemoth retailer. Clearly Amazon is doing something right. Read more   By Nick Foy  July 6, 2017Driving Change in Manufacturing & Logistics: Cognitive TechnologyWhen you think of cognitive technology, what comes to mind? Likely one of those funky virtual reality headsets or – if you’re more of a skeptic – an army of robots rebelling to take over all of humanity. But cognitive technology is about a lot more than futuristic-looking toys and speculation about the future, specifically when you consider its various applications in the manufacturing and logistics industries.

From Uber working to develop a fleet of driverless taxis to automakers like Toyota and Mercedes leaking plans for their own autonomous cars, the world has gone crazy over driverless vehicles.

Read more   By Orsolya Vegvari  June 16, 2017Tackling E-commerce and Fulfillment at eTail Europe 2017In the past decade, the retail industry has changed dramatically. Most notable has been the shift from traditional brick-and-mortar shopping to online and mobile purchasing. As a result of this shift, retailers have been forced to focus on e-commerce and fulfillment strategies to ensure the online or mobile customer has the same excellent experience that retailers were once solely focused on delivering in-store. Read more   By Nick Foy  June 13, 2017Driving Change in Manufacturing & Logistics: Consumer BehaviorToday’s shopping experience is nearly unrecognizable to that of just twenty years ago. In the past two decades, consumers have shifted where, when, why and how they shop. Gone are the days of shopping exclusively in brick-and-mortar stores. Shopping today no longer requires you to leave your house, or even your couch, with nearly 8 out of 10 Americans reporting regularly shopping online or from their mobile device.

Driving the increase were higher revenues in Asia and Europe, up 11.6% and 3.3%, respectively, partially offset by declines in the Americas and in the company’s e-Business segment. The company reported an operating loss of $5.2 million for the quarter ended April 30, 2017, as compared to an operating loss of $12.5 million for the same period in the prior year, an improvement of $7.3 million. The company reported a net loss of $5.1 million or a net loss per basic and diluted share of $0.09 for the quarter ended April 30, 2017.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
