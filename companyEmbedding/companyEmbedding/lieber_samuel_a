To separate children from jails which housed men, women, insane, sane people altogether. Very atrocious conditions.Before it was created, children were punished the same way as adults. 1800's Mentally ill/ Prison Reform By: Dana Nickens, Emily Herchenroder and Sein An The Big QuestionWhy did people bother to reform prisons and Mental Institutions? Causes Of the Reform Dorothea Dix - “The sick and insane people are confined in cages, closets, cellars, stalls! Chained, beaten with rods-” Prisons were overflowing with everyone- from murderers to people who simply spitted on street. Men, women, children were thrown together in the most unpleasant conditions. Goals and Objectives WE NEED TO CHANGE Who is Key?? Goals Reform Punishment of crimesBetter conditions of  jailBetter treatment for mentally illSeparate facility for juvenile and adult offenders Dorthea Dix was a major part of the reform.Started the change and took action firstcreated the first generation of American mental institutions in the USbegan her crusade for humane hospitalsoften toured prisons, workhouses, and private homes to observe any abusesUltimately, she gathered five psychiatric hospitals in America Dr. John Galt -  invented the "talk therapy" approach.Louis Dwight- added Sabbath Schools to jails to educate prisonersFrancis Lieber & Samuel Gridley Howe- their goals were prison libraries, basic literacy (for Bible reading), reduction of whipping and beating, commutation of sentences, and separation of women, children and the sick. SUCCESSES & FAILIURES & LIMITATIONS Do you think children who committed crimes should be treated the same way as adults? IMportant Events 1. Pennsylvania's Eastern State Penitentiary (1829)- A new "reformed" prison Prisoners were physically isolatedEvery prison cell had its own exercise yard, work area, and personal hygiene facilities. Other Important People Small Questions: Why did we need change?Who was Dorthea Dix and what did she do to change the jail and mental institution?What did Francis Lieber and Samuel Gridley Howe do?Was the prison/mental institution reform successful? SUCCESS Increase in number of mental hospitalsSuccessfully persuaded legislature to fund the bill to expand the Worcester state hospital for the insane.Food was finally given to jailersAuburn System Some flaws in Auburn Prison System- Some people thought Labor punishment was pointless hard work- Some prisoners not put into rehabilitation Bad quality of food 4.By the turn of the twentieth century, most forms of corporal punishment had been abolished, people started to realize the prisoners should still have some rights. FAILURES LIMITATIONS Because this reform could not solve every problem, there was another prison reform.
