Everi Holdings Inc. Key Developments

Everi Holdings Inc. Launches Casablanca™ on New Empire MPX™ Premium Cabinet for Class II Wide-Area Progressive and Class III Local-Area Progressive
Jun 22 17
Everi Holdings Inc. announced the launch of Casablanca, a video-reel game and the company’s first licensed game theme for its Wide-Area Progressive (WAP) link, developed exclusively for Class II markets, and Local-Area Progressive (LAP) developed for Class III markets. Casablanca is featured on the Empire MPX, Everi’s newest premium gaming cabinet, and is part of the company’s Class II WAP link which went live in February 2017. The new Casablanca game theme is now live at three casinos across Oklahoma, Connecticut and Louisiana and will be rolled out to many more casinos and markets in the coming months. Everi’s Class II WAP link has a base jackpot amount of $100,000 and combines popular games with a large linked progressive platform and unique math model to heighten player excitement and engagement. Leveraging the unique characteristics of the Empire MPX cabinet, Casablanca features iconic entertainment elements from the classic film that truly elevate the exciting slot game play. Based on the 1942 timeless American romantic drama, Casablanca is a five-reel, 30-line video game with multiple exciting bonus features, including the Rick’s Café bonus featuring the classic song, “As Time Goes By.” Perfectly capturing the timeless chemistry between Rick Blaine and Ilsa Lund, the new Casablanca slot game brings the romance and adventure of Rick’s Café Americain to life on casino floors. The Empire MPX cabinet offers casino operators the flexibility to “nest” the cabinets in several different bank configurations, allowing for the placement of more cabinets in a dedicated space which saves up to 25% casino floor space compared to traditional bank configurations. The Empire MPX also features a 43-inch full HD display, game-controlled lighting with backlight feature, a new ergonomic LCD button deck with the Company’s award-winning Everi Bet™ wager configuration feature and USB support docks. In addition, Everi’s new Empire MPX includes two overhead spotlight features and an optional 55-inch full HD overhead Empire sign.

Brings 22 Years of Proven Gaming Equipment Supplier Leadership and Expertise to Drive Company’s Games Segment Growth Initiatives
LAS VEGAS, Jan.  10, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Everi Holdings Inc. (NYSE:EVRI) (“Everi” or the “Company”), the casino gaming industry’s single source provider of gaming products and payments solutions, today announced the appointment of accomplished gaming equipment supplier executive, Dean Ehrlich, as Executive Vice President and Games Business Leader, effective January 1, 2017.  Mr. Ehrlich, who will report directly to Everi’s President and CEO, Michael Rumbolz, has served as a consultant to the Company since August 1, 2016.
As Executive Vice President and Games Business Leader, Mr. Ehrlich has direct responsibilities for the Company’s Games business, including oversight of the game development studios located in Austin, Chicago and Reno, manufacturing and assembly, and Everi’s gaming operations including the New York Lottery central system operation.  He assumes these responsibilities from David Lucchese who was recently appointed Executive Vice President, Digital and Interactive Business Leader, a new position at the Company. Ehrlich joins Everi following his time at Scientific Games Corporation, which included service at WMS Industries, Inc. prior to its acquisition by Scientific Games in October 2013. From 2003 to July 2015, he held various senior management positions including SVP of Global Gaming Operations where he led an annual $675 million business for premium lease products; VP of Sales, North America where he led commercial sales operations responsible for over $500 million in annual revenue generated from product sales, gaming operations and game conversions; and Executive Director of Product Management & Strategy where he led the development of WMS’ wide-area progressive strategic initiatives.  Prior to his time at Scientific Games/WMS, Ehrlich was with International Game Technology (“IGT”) from 1994 to 2003, which includes his time with Anchor Gaming, Inc. from 1994 through its acquisition by IGT in 2002.  His time at IGT/Anchor included serving as General Manager of the Proprietary Games Division and Director of Product Marketing: IGT MegaJackpots.  Mr. Ehrlich has a Bachelor of Arts degree from San Diego State University.   “Dean enhances the depth of our Games management team as he is a proven leader with significant expertise and experience in the gaming industry,” said Michael Rumbolz, President and Chief Executive Officer of Everi.  “Throughout his more than 20 years in the industry Dean has demonstrated a track record of success in driving gaming equipment sales, fostering innovative product development initiatives in a variety of areas including wide-area progressive products, and optimizing manufacturing and supply chain operations.  We expect Dean’s strong management skills along with his extensive gaming industry experience, relationships and knowledge of our customer base will be instrumental in helping us to further execute on our goal to grow the sales and profitability of our Games business.  “The addition of Dean to the management team also provides an opportunity for us to expand our focus on our digital and interactive business.  Dave Lucchese brings extensive gaming industry knowledge as well as product and development expertise that will enable us to establish the strategic vision for our digital and interactive business as we seek to further leverage our gaming content expertise across new distribution channels.”   Dean Ehrlich commented on his appointment, “Having worked closely with Mike and many other members of the Everi team over the last five months, including at the G2E trade show last September, I know this is an exciting time to join the Company.  Customer reaction to our newest products which premiered at G2E was very favorable and we have an excellent product development roadmap in place that we expect will help grow our business.  In addition, significant progress has been made in refining processes and operating practices throughout our Games segment which is already benefiting our game development, manufacturing and sales initiatives.  By partnering with both our employees and our customers, I look forward to achieving our growth initiatives across the Games business and becoming a premiere electronic gaming machine supplier of choice.” About Everi HoldingsEveri Holdings is dedicated to providing video and mechanical reel gaming content and technology solutions, integrated gaming payments solutions and compliance and efficiency software. The Company’s Games business provides: (a) comprehensive content, electronic gaming units and systems for Native American and commercial casinos, including the award winning TournEvent® slot tournament solution; and (b) the central determinant system for the video lottery terminals installed at racetracks in the State of New York.
