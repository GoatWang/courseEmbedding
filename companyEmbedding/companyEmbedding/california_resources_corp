Crude Oil
California Resources Corporation's (CRC) oil production is connected to California markets via our oil gathering pipelines which are used almost entirely for our production. We generally do not transport, refine or process the oil we produce and we sell almost all of our oil into the California refining markets. We believe these markets are among the most favorable in the U.S. because California imports a significant percentage of its oil requirements from outside the state, mostly from foreign locations.
Natural Gas Liquids
CRC’s production from oil and gas reservoirs typically includes oil, produced water, natural gas (methane), and natural gas liquids (NGLs) that include ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline. CRC processes NGLs through our processing plants, which facilitate access to third-party delivery points near the Elk Hills Field.
Natural Gas
CRC is the largest natural gas producer in California, which imports approximately 90 percent of the natural gas consumed in the state. We sell our natural gas production in the state and use intrastate transportation contracts to facilitate delivery of our natural gas to customers.
Electricity
CRC’s Elk Hills Power Plant generates electricity from natural gas in the Elk Hills Field. With a capacity of 550 megawatts (MW), the plant’s electricity powers the Elk Hills Field and supplies excess power to the State’s electrical grid sufficient to power more than 300,000 homes. Elk Hills also has a 46 MW cogeneration facility that provides steam and electricity to the Elk Hills Field, and THUMS Long Beach Company operates a 45 MW power generating facility that provides electricity to the Wilmington Field in Long Beach.

Energy for California by Californians
California Resources Corporation (CRC) is an oil and natural gas exploration and production company operating high-growth, high-return conventional and unconventional assets exclusively in California. CRC explores for, produces, gathers, processes and markets crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. CRC makes significant use of proven modern technologies to enhance safety and efficient production across our leading mineral acreage position and diverse portfolio.
CRC provides “Energy for California by Californians.” California homes, farms, businesses and communities need ample, affordable and reliable energy, and CRC’s dedicated workforce of approximately 4,000 California employees and contractors develops dependable local oil and natural gas reserves that help to reduce our state’s chronic dependence on imported energy. For the past three years, our employees have received Excellence Achievement Awards from the National Safety Council for their exemplary safety performance  across our statewide operations.
Investing in California
CRC is also an economic engine for California. Since 2014, our operations have spent $5 billion with more than 2,000 vendors and provided approximately $1.2 billion in revenues and taxes to the State and our host counties and cities where we live and work.
CRC is the largest oil and natural gas producer in California on a gross-operated basis and we believe we have established the largest privately-held mineral acreage position in the state, consisting of approximately 2.3 million net acres spanning the state's four major oil and gas basins. We have a sizable inventory of over 30,900 gross drilling locations and 6,400 gross prospective resource drilling locations throughout the state and a significant portfolio of conventional and unconventional opportunities from which we plan to generate production growth over the longer term.
See www.crc.com Investor Relations for important information about drilling locations.
As an independent company operating exclusively on California, we apply advanced technologies to grow local energy production in a safe, environmentally responsible and cost-effective manner that is consistent with the interests of our surrounding communities.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM)  0.96 (07/27/17)      EPS (TTM)  $8.82      Market Cap $359.12 M     Shares Outstanding 42.50 M     Public Float 37.65 M     Yield CRC has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    0.70      Net Money Flow ($)  -593,709    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.
