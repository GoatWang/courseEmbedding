About Charlesbank




An established private equity firm with a consistent track record, disciplined investment strategy and long-standing commitment to the middle market









Our Firm




Charlesbank Capital Partners is an experienced middle-market private equity firm with offices in Boston and New York City. We invest across a range of industries, supporting skilled management teams in building strong businesses, primarily in the United States.
Charlesbank’s senior team has worked together for many years, establishing a consistent record of strong returns over multiple business cycles. We bring a flexible approach to the structure of each portfolio company investment, and we are comfortable working in situations that are complex or difficult to underwrite.






Our Roots




Before establishing Charlesbank as an independent firm in 1998, we managed an investment portfolio solely for the Harvard University endowment. Today our limited partners include numerous college endowments, foundations, public and corporate pension funds, family offices, banks and insurance companies from the United States, Canada, Europe and Asia.







Our Name







	    				The Charles River is one of Boston’s most cherished natural features. It begins west of the city and winds 80 miles before flowing into Boston Harbor. The river was a source of economic power for early settlers who saw the opportunity for prosperity in this waterway connecting the interior to the bay. 

The name Charlesbank reflects our roots with Harvard University, whose campus lines the banks of the river in Cambridge. The Charles River is a powerful symbol, outwardly tranquil but steadily moving, with a rich history and enduring presence.

In 2000, the firm raised $600 million for Charlesbank Equity Fund V, its first fund to include outside institutional investors. Subsequent funds include Charlesbank Equity Fund VI ($1 billion raised in 2005), Charlesbank Equity Fund VII ($1.5 billion raised in 2009) and Charlesbank Equity Fund VIII ($1.75 billion raised in 2014).[3][4] The firm's founders include CEO Michael R. Eisenson, Kim Davis, Tim Palmer, Mark Rosen and Michael Thonis. Charlesbank is currently led by the founding team and fellow managing directors Jon Biotti, Sam Bartlett, Ryan Carroll, Michael Choe (President), Andrew Janower, Joshua Klevens and Brandon White. The firm employs more than 40 people between its Boston and New York City offices and has over $3.0 billion of capital under management.[citation needed]

Charlesbank sells Peacock Foods to Greencore


January 3, 2017
By Iris Dorbian






Charlesbank Capital Partners has sold Peacock Foods to Greencore Group plc. No financial terms were disclosed. Jefferies LLC acted as lead financial adviser to Peacock and Charlesbank, with Houlihan Lokey acting as co-adviser. Based in Geneva, Illinois, Peacock is a food manufacturer and provider of packaging and supply chain management solutions to top consumer food companies.
PRESS RELEASE
BOSTON, MA–(Marketwired – January 03, 2017) – Private equity firm Charlesbank Capital Partners, LLC today announced that its affiliates have sold their interests in Peacock Foods to Greencore Group plc, an international producer of convenience foods based in Ireland and listed on the London Stock Exchange. Peacock is a leading food manufacturer and provider of packaging and supply chain management solutions to many of the top consumer food companies in the United States. Customers include Tyson Foods®, KraftHeinz® and Dole®. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
Charlesbank acquired Peacock in 2010. Headquartered in Geneva, IL, the company operates seven manufacturing facilities and has a long track record of quality and safety as well as expertise in automation, project engineering, packaging and processing. In 2015, Peacock acquired L&L Foods, a provider of high-volume, single-serve/portion-control packages of food products. The acquisition provided access into rapidly growing end-markets (prepared salad kits and away-from-home products), diversified Peacock’s customer base and expanded its geographic footprint. In conjunction with L&L, Peacock added a new West Coast facility to support strong growth of the business and expand its presence for other customers. As the food industry increasingly turns toward outsourced manufacturing, Peacock maintains strong market positions in fast-growing categories such as frozen breakfast sandwiches, kids’ snack kits and salad kits. 





In addition to the L&L acquisition, during Charlesbank’s ownership the company saw a period of strong organic growth and launched significant lean manufacturing and human capital development initiatives. Additionally, Charlesbank recruited Tom Sampson, a food industry veteran with a long, successful career at Kraft Foods, to become the CEO of Peacock in 2013. Ryan Carroll, a managing director at Charlesbank, said, “We are gratified to have had the opportunity to partner with Tom Sampson and his exceptional team to build on Peacock’s industry-leading position and well-deserved record of success. This has been a rewarding investment for our investors and Charlesbank, and we wish Peacock and Greencore well as they continue to execute on their promising growth strategy.”
“We have enjoyed a terrific partnership with Charlesbank and appreciate their valuable support and insight over the past several years,” said Mr. Sampson. “Together we have strengthened customer relationships, won important new business, significantly improved our operations and expanded our capabilities — while maintaining our reputation for outstanding quality, food safety and service. Greencore shares our commitment to the US convenience food market, and we are excited to join their team. With complementary competencies and enhanced operating capacity, we will improve the experience for our customers and fortify a platform for sustained growth.”
Jefferies LLC served as lead financial advisor to Peacock and Charlesbank, with Houlihan Lokey serving as co-advisor.

Charlesbank acquires Tecomet from Genstar


May 1, 2017
By Iris Dorbian






Genstar Capital has sold Wilmington, Massachusetts-based Tecomet, a provider of high-precision manufacturing solutions for “complex, tight-tolerance” products. The buyer is Charlesbank Capital Partners. No financial terms were disclosed. William Blair & Company LLC served as lead financial adviser to Tecomet on the transaction while Weil, Gotshal &Manges acted as legal adviser.
PRESS RELEASE
SAN FRANCISCO, May 1, 2017 – Genstar Capital, a leading middle-market private equity firm focused on investments in targeted segments of the industrial technology, healthcare, financial services, and software industries, today announced the sale of Tecomet, a leading global provider of high-precision manufacturing solutions for complex, tight-tolerance products, to Charlesbank Capital Partners.
Tecomet provides highly-engineered, essential products to the medical and aerospace &amp; defense industries. Its products include orthopedic implants, complex surgical instruments,trauma plates and photochemical etched products for medical device customers. For the aerospace &amp; defense industry, Tecomet manufactures precision components used in missile and satellite propulsion systems, commercial aviation, vision systems, and infrared applications.
Founded in 1964 and based in Wilmington, Massachusetts, Tecomet was acquired by Genstar in December 2013.
During its slightly more than three-year ownership, Genstar partnered with management to complete three strategic acquisitions, expand the company’s senior leadership team, including the recruitment of current CEO Mark Kemp, and position the Company for strong organic growth going forward. Since 2013, the Company more than quadrupled in size and today offers a full breadth of products and value-added services globally to its customers. 





Rob Rutledge, Managing Director of Genstar, said, “We are very pleased with Tecomet’s development, which was achieved via strong organic growth as we broadened and diversified the company’s capabilities to strengthen its value proposition in existing sectors of the medical and aerospace markets, in addition to expanding into new high-growth sectors. The successful integration of new acquisitions and partnerships also solidified the company’s leading position as an industry ‘innovation leader’ and Tecomet is well-positioned for continued long-term growth. We are pleased to retain a portion of our investment in the company and are excited to be part of the next chapter of Tecomet’s growth.”
Mark Kemp, Chief Executive Officer of Tecomet, said, “Genstar’s partnership with Tecomet and their involvement was invaluable as the company significantly repositioned itself into one of the world’s largest solutions providers to the medical device and aerospace &amp; defense industries. With Genstar’s strategic support and financial resources, we meaningfully increased our product offering, expanded our geographic reach into Europe and Asia Pacific and commercialized our unique proprietary technologies. Working in concert with Genstar to implement a dynamic growth plan, Tecomet transformed into a stronger global competitor and there are numerous avenues to continue this exceptional track record of growth in the medical device and aerospace &amp; defense end markets.” 





In March of 2017, Genstar announced the closing of their new Fund VIII, which has $3.95 billion of committed capital. As part of their investment strategy, Genstar will continue seeking to invest in industry-leading companies that focus on manufacturing and distributing precision components for healthcare-focused end markets, and can benefit from the capital, network and resources Genstar provides to their companies. William Blair & Company, LLC acted as lead financial advisor to Tecomet and Weil, Gotshal &Manges acted as legal advisor.
