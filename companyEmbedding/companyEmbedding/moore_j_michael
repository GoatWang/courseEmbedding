product liability
n. the responsibility of manufacturers, distributors and sellers of products to the public, to deliver products
free of defects which harm an individual or numerous persons and to make good on that responsibility if 
their products are defective. These can include faulty auto brakes, contaminated baby food, exploding 
bottles of beer, flammable children's pajamas, or lack of label warnings. Examples: Beauty Queen Hair 
Products makes a hair-permanent kit in which the formula will cause loss of hair to women with sensitive 
scalps, and Molly Makeup has her hair done at the Bon Ton Beauty Shop and suffers scalp burns and 
loss of hair. Molly has a claim for damages against Beauty Queen, the manufacturer. Big Boy Trucks 
makes a truck with a faulty steering gear, bought by Tom Hold tight. The gear fails and Hold tight runs off 
the road and breaks his back. Hold tight can sue Big Boy for the damages. The key element in products 
liability law is that a person who suffers harm need not prove negligence, since the negligence is 
"presumed" and the result is "strict liability" (absolute responsibility) on the seller, distributor and 
manufacturer. An injured person usually need only sue the seller and let him/her/it bring the manufacturer 
or distributor into the lawsuit or require contribution toward a judgment. However, all those possibly 
responsible should be named in the suit as defendants if they are known. (See:

product liability
liability in tort or delict in respect of produce. Essentially an application of the law of tort although the term 
can be used to cover liability under sale and supply of goods. A famous decision of the House of Lords in 
1932 created product liability: ‘a manufacturer of products, which he sells in such a form as to show that 
he intends them to reach the ultimate consumer in the form in which they left him with no reasonable 
possibility of intermediate examination, and with the knowledge that the absence of reasonable care in 
the preparation or putting up of the products will result in an injury to the consumer's life or property, owes
a duty to the consumer to take that reasonable care.’ Liability was only for fault. A combination of 
consumer pressure in the late 20th century and the need for harmonization of laws in the 
EUROPEAN 
UNION

E. Gonzalez – Mission, TX

I called Mr. Moore after I fell at a Wal-Mart towel aisle on a wet floor last year. Strained my lower back and was able to get treatment and the help I needed quickly. Mr. Moore was able to get me $35k take home and I am VERY happy!













D. Moros – Donna, TX

After making my claim against my insurance company I was told that I did not qualify for any money for repairs. I let them know that I was desperate being that my roof was very damaged. They ignored me and said that it would only take a few hundred dollars to fix it. I then heard about Moore Law firm and decided to get more information. That is the best decision that I have ever done. They helped me and guided on getting the money I needed to make the repairs. In about four months I received enough money to put a new roof on my home. I am pleased with the work that they have done and recommend them to anyone who needs help with Insurance claims or even any legal matter. Thank you to the staff that is always courteous and always willing to go the extra mile.













P. McDonald – Pharr, TX

After being bullied by our insurance company and not getting paid what we needed to make the repairs on our home we decided to call Moore Law firm to get more information on how we could get help. They explained how everything would work in detail and let me know that they would make sure that we got the help we needed. I can now say that I am extremely grateful for everything they did and for always keeping us posted on the status our case. We will forever be happy for having the opportunity to repair our home and getting the money we deserve! Thank you Moore Law firm for your wonderful staff.













I Tamez – Hidalgo, TX

After being disappointed with the way my insurance company handled my claim I thought that my house would never be back to normal. When one of my close friends let me know that she knew of a firm that would help with hail damage claims I decided to give them a chance. Now, after my insurance finally came through I have no one to thank but Moore Law firm. They are excellent people who truly take the time to work on an individual basis and don’t make you feel just like a number. I would like to thank them for my undying gratitude and let everyone know that if you ever need help with any type of legal matter Moore Law firm is the place to go!













C. Benavides – Brownsville, TX

After the hail storm that happened in our area our house was really damaged and our insurance company refused to help us. I am glad I saw their commercial and called because without them I would have never gotten the help I deserved! Moore Law firm along with attorney Michael Moore are a great team that helped me beyond expectations! My house will finally be back to normal as well as my life. Thank you for a job well done!













L. Garcia – McAllen, TX

I am an elderly citizen of McAllen and when the hail storm damaged my home the insurance company took advantage of me and refused to pay what I deserved. I went to Attorney Michael Moore and he and his staff were the most dedicated people I have ever dealt with. Ever since receiving my settlement and fixing my home I am recommending him to everyone I know needs help. Just like I told Attorney Moore I would gladly go back to him for any other legal matter I would need. He is the best! I cannot express my undying gratitude for him and his staff. Thank you again for helping rebuild my home just to how it was when I first bought it!













J. Resendez – La Joya, TX

We are very grateful for the Moore Law firm for helping us obtain more than what our insurance should have paid us. After disappointment at the beginning now at the end we are very satisfied. Thanks for all your help and support. We appreciate your firm for helping us to get us getting our life back to normal. Amazing work!
