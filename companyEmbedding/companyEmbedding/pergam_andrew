"Andy has done a tremendous job of building our digital video team to work with our markets to achieve significant growth in both revenue and traffic," said Talamantes.  "His tireless passion for building new digital projects, working with entrepreneurs and developing teams to meet business challenges will continue to be a huge asset for McClatchy."
Pergam joined McClatchy in 2014 as its first-ever Head of Video.  In this role he has been instrumental in advancing McClatchy's video expertise at the corporate level and in all 28 markets and the DC bureau.  Under Pergam's leadership, the company has seen substantial growth in video traffic and revenue.  He also led the creation of McClatchy's Emerging Video Ventures initiative, which invests in early-stage video-related companies. 
"McClatchy's commitment to imagining and supporting new initiatives is refreshing," said Pergam. "While the challenges are great, the opportunities are even greater.  I'm honored to be able to work with so many great digital thinkers inside and outside our company and am excited to take on this role."
Pergam came to McClatchy from The Washington Post where he was Senior Editor and the Director of Video.  While at The Post, he helped grow its video operation and launch PostTV.  Pergam is the co-founder of Spark Camp, an event series that gathers creative thinkers in media, technology and other industries.  Pergam also serves on the advisory boards for Matter, a San Francisco- and New York-based media accelerator, and Watchup, a video startup. 
Pergam and his family will continue to reside in Washington, DC.
