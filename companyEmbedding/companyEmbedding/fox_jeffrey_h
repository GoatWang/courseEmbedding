Fox 1Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeDr. Fox is very unethical in his business practices!Was this rating useful? 1 flag | Submitted December 9, 2016 1Staff 2Punctuality 1Helpfulness 2KnowledgeThe whole dental office including Dr. Fox, the receptionist, and the office manager are completely unethical. They overcharge on billing, so please know what your insurance covers. They bill for more expensive procedures than were actually provided, which happened to me. They tried to overcharge me four times my co payment for fillings, and billed my insurance company for the same procedure. Also, Dr. Fox made a mistake and used silver (Amalgam) fillings when I requested white (Composite) fillings during the initial visit at his office. I tried to contact the office several different times to rectify the mistake and speak with Dr. Fox, but the receptionist made excuses that he is busy and cannot talk. Extremely frustrated with the whole situation, I requested a refund but they have yet to refund my credit card. My insurance company is currently looking into this matter against Fox Dental for "upcoding.Reconsider and chose another dental office. Learn from my unfortunate experience.Was this rating useful? 6 flag | Submitted December 23, 2013 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI have been a patient of Dr. Fox for many years. I have found him to be personable, warm and caring. He took the time to answer all of my concerns and questions. It is obvious that he keeps up with advancements is the very best in his field. After my surgery he took the time to call to ask how I was feeling. I gained confidence with my new smile and couldn't be happier. The office staff was always professional and made sure to make appointments that I could work into my busy schedule.Was this rating useful? 1 Submitted November 8, 2013 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Fox was very knowledgeable about all the different types of implants. I was a little bit skeptical because he as considerably less expensive than the other implant dentists I had consultations with. He gave me two references from patients that had similar treatment who only had positive experiences and nice things to say. He does charity work and goes on missions in areas of the world that need dentists which goes a long way in describing the type of character this man possesses. One of my implants didn't take, but it was no big deal. He told me that could happen and he took care of it immediately and painlessly. I think he's an honest and dedicated dentist who enjoys his work. I have referred him to several of my coworkers.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted November 4, 2013 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI was told that I couldn't have implants. My dentist sent me to an oral surgeon and he told me I needed grafts and sinus lifts and expensive procedures that would take almost 2 years and cost me over $50,000. My dentist actually gave me a home equity loan to fill out to finance the treatment. I think he gets a cutback from the oral surgeon. Anyway, I went to Dr. Fox because I heard about mini implants and Dr. Fox was able to perform all the treatment in 2 months. I never took off a day of work. His office is amazing. He gave me his cell phone number to call in case I ever had any problems during treatment. Totally professional and totally amazaing experience. I cant believe how simple it was and how qualified he seemed to be. Very confident. Very clean office with the most amazing equipment. I can't begin to describe how happy I am.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted September 23, 2013 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr. Fox gave me my smile back after years of being ashamed to smile. In only one visit I was sedated and woke up with a beautiful white smile. After only a few more appointments I had my final teeth in and could not be happier. I can not say enough about how well I was treated and how fast the work was done. Also the office staff was very professional and super friendly.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted February 16, 2013 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr.Fox and his staff are a pleasure to work with. Dr.Fox is not your typical dentist who rushes you out to get to the next patient I have seen many dentist in the past years and once I had found Dr.Fox all of my prayers where answered. He takes his time to explain everything and actually cares which is are to find in the medical field these days!Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted January 10, 2013 4Staff 3Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeGreat marketing.....I have had a lot of dental work. FOX IS THE WORST DENTIST I EVER ENCOUNTERED, I unfortunately had cosmetic work done and it has failed after only one year.
