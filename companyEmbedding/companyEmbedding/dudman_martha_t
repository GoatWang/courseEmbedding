Augusta, Gone: Screaming Daughter, Hysterical Mother

			 Review by kchowell 


  April, 19 2001
            



Pros: Lovely cover photography


Cons: A former rebellious teen complains about her own rebellious teen. Boo hoo.


			    I have no idea what possessed me when I decided to read Augusta, Gone: A True Story. I?m not a parent, so I really have no need to study a parent?s perspective on how to handle a teenager who?s leading a life that?s a worse mess than David Spade?s film career. And I?m far enough away from my own teen years that I can?t really empathize with a rebellious, misunderstood, self-destructive high school student. Besides, I was never terribly rebellious or reckless myself as a teen, and I never truly could understand why some of my peers seemed hell-bent on getting into and causing trouble.   But I?d read a few reviews of the book, and when I saw it on the new release table at the library, its stylish black and white cover photo enhancing its appeal, I couldn?t resist. Although I knew at some level that the true story of an exasperated mom trying to rein in her out-of-control teenager would be something akin to reality TV?s literary equivalent, I found myself checking out the book, anyway.   Martha Dudman was a young woman careening out of control. She smoked a lot of pot. She found ways to steal out of the house for nights of torrid lust with her high school boyfriend. She regularly used LSD, and just about any other drug she could get her hands on. Her academic career suffered to the point that she was not allowed to graduate with her high school class. Eventually, at the age of seventeen, she ran off to San Francisco to live in a nasty tenement in the Tenderloin.   No wonder her mother was at her wit?s end, you might think. Of course she would need to write a book to process such parental agony!   But wait? Martha Dudman is the author of the book! It?s her daughter, Augusta, who?s out of control.   And guess what sort of unacceptable behavior Augusta is exhibiting? Augusta stays out all night, skips school, and smokes pot. She does all these things while wearing her mother?s vintage hippie clothes from the 60?s.   So am I wrong to wonder why Ms Dudman is so bent out of shape by her daughter?s behavior? Is Augusta not something of a Mini-Martha, copying her formerly rebellious mother?s every move?   According to Dudman, this really isn?t the same at all. The world is more dangerous now? there are so many more risks. Most priceless is her take on newfangled weed:   I know it?s not the gentle grass of the sixties. They treat it with something now, don?t they? It?s powerful.   Yes, I?m just about certain that high school biology and chemistry classes are so advanced these days that Joe sophomore is able to genetically engineer the ganja that he?s surreptitiously growing in the weeds behind his mommy?s roses. To steal an expression from one of my favorite Epinions Gourmet Advisors: Puh-lease!   Martha Dudman needs a clue.   First, let clarify that I don?t necessarily condone Augusta?s behavior; I certainly don?t think that it?s healthy for a teen to be staying out all night, using illegal substances, and skipping school. What really rankles me about Augusta, Gone is that the mother seems to separate her own youthful indiscretions from those of her daughter. Dudman seems to have deluded herself into thinking that Augusta?s actions are somehow more dangerous and more risky than anything that she did during her own teen days.   While reading Augusta, Gone, I was hit over the head with so many pot-kettle moments that I almost wished that I was watching reality television instead. Reading about Martha?s frustrations with Augusta is like watching those women on COPS, who shake their heads in disgust as their boyfriend/lover/husband is hog-tied and taken away dirty and bare-footed to county jail, missing completely that this is the man that they?ve chosen as their life partner/father of their children.   It?s like watching hyperactive grenade-haired flirt Mandy call Billy ?trash? after watching him perform a rowdy striptease for the predatory Fantasy Singles on Temptation Island. You wonder if she?s forgotten that she?d agreed to appear on the show herself, and that she?d let some guy with Sideshow Bob hair drink tequila out of her belly button just a day or two previously. Aargh!   It?s not that Augusta?s behavior isn?t truly scary?it is. It?s just that it?s hard to sympathize with poor, suffering Martha when you know that she put her own mother through the exact same type of teen angst torture.   Listen up, Ms Dudman? you know what they say about payback. You did it to your mom, and now it?s your turn.   Eventually, Augusta gets so out of control that Martha decides to send her off to a wilderness treatment program. I?ve always been skeptical about placing a depressed and angry teen in the exclusive company of other depressed and angry teens, and it seems that Augusta actually gets worse while in the program. She grows even more depressed, and finally the drama culminates when Augusta breaks free of the treatment center and completes her quest to be a carbon copy of her mother by running off to San Francisco, just like her mother did back in the Free Love decade.   It?s amazing, really. Augusta claims to hate her mother; Martha hates her daughter?s behavior. And yet? their lives are taking parallel courses. I?m sure that oh, around 2020, Augusta will be penning her own tale about her disrespectful and disobedient daughter.   Augusta, Gone is a heartbreaking book to read, but not for the obvious reasons. Yes, it is sad that Augusta is doing potentially dangerous things that could hurt her future or possibly end her life. But it?s even sadder that her mother honestly seems surprised that Augusta took that road. Exactly when did Martha lose touch with the emotions that caused her to do the same things that her daughter eventually did? It seems that if Dudman could have reconnected with her teen self for just a moment, she could have understood her daughter?s misery, and perhaps taken more effective steps to support her daughter through this time.   In any case, it?s frustrating to read this book, in which Dudman engages in a lot of self-centered self-pity, and never fully grasps the fact that perhaps her own personality and tendencies might be making things with her darling daughter significantly worse. I?d even say that Augusta, with her venom, anger, recklessness and complete lack of self-discipline, is the more sympathetic of the two women.   Augusta, Gone was a completely unsatisfying self-pity fest. You?re better off sticking with the worst that reality television has to offer.
