J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. is a trucking and transportation company that was founded by Johnnie Bryan Hunt, and based in the Northwest Arkansas city of Lowell. J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. was incorporated in Arkansas on August 10, 1961 and originally started with five trucks and seven refrigerated trailers to support the original rice hull business. By 1983, J.B. Hunt had grown into the 80th largest trucking firm in the U.S. and earned $63 million in revenue. At that time J.B. Hunt was operating 550 tractors, 1,049 trailers, and had roughly 1,050 employees. Today this company has grown into one of the largest transportation companies in the United States with annual revenues of about $7 billion. J.B. Hunt primarily operates large semi-trailer trucks, and provides transportation services throughout the continental United States, Canada and Mexico. The company currently employs over 22,000 employees and operates in excess of 12,000 trucks. Over 100,000 trailers and containers can be found in the company's fleet.[1]
J.B. Hunt's major competitors in the United States are Swift Transportation, Schneider National, Werner Enterprises, and Hub Group.
J.B. Hunt Transport is a leader in the industry in technology and operation. In 1989, J.B. Hunt Transport started partnering with railroads to offer intermodal service. Today, about two-thirds of the company’s revenues and profits come from intermodal. The company also launched a specialized trucking service division along with a flatbed operation, which was later sold.
Dedicated Contract Service (DCS): Started in 1992. DCS operations typically provide customized services that are governed by long-term contracts and currently include dry-van, flatbed, temperature-controlled, dump trailers and local inner-city operations

Intermodal (JBI): The JBI segment began operations in 1989 with a partnership with the former Santa Fe Railway (now the BNSF Railway Company). Essentially, JBI draws on the intermodal (also known as "container on flatcar") services of rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment and performs the pickups and deliveries ("drayage") for customers at the origin and destination rail terminal locations. May directly provide the drayage service at either the origin or destination rail ramp using company-controlled tractors, or they purchase these services from third parties.
Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS): This segment includes full truckload, dry-van freight using company-controlled tractors operating over roads and highways. ICS also features a suite of specialty transportation services including Less than Truck Load (LTL), Refrigerated, and Flatbed. ICS reported record revenue in 2016 of over $800 million.
Truck: This segment includes full truckload, dry-van freight, using company-controlled tractors operating over roads and highways.

Publicly traded logistics company J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. of Lowell said Friday that it has agreed to buy Special Logistics Dedicated LLC of Houston for $136 million.
In a news release, the company said the move will expand its e-commerce delivery platform.
"SLD`s strong customer base and strategically placed fulfillment centers position us as a top national pool distribution services provider," John Roberts, J.B. Hunt`s president and CEO, said in a news release. "This acquisition will also allow our customers to deploy `big and bulky` inventories into key markets, improving order fulfillment times for Final Mile deliveries and further enhancing our e-commerce delivery capabilities. We are excited to welcome the employees, customers, and carriers of SLD to J.B. Hunt."
There is no assumption of debt in the deal, and J.B. Hunt said it will use its existing revolving credit facility to finance this transaction "and to provide liquidity for future operations." The company expects the deal to be immaterial to 2017 operating results and accretive in 2018.
SLD provides pool distribution services throughout North America using 14 terminals and fulfillment centers and a fleet of more than 850 pieces of equipment. Services include dedicated transportation at both dedicated and multi-use sites; cross-docking and contract logistics; less-than-truckload product consolidation; commingled pool distribution; and a Texas-based intrastate 57` dry van highway service.
Earlier this week, J.B. Hunt posted second-quarter net income of $97.9 million, down nearly 7 percent from the same quarter last year.(c) APS  2017.

J.B. Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



      J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ: JBHT), one of the largest 
      supply chain solutions providers in North America, today announced it 
      has entered into an agreement to acquire Special Logistics Dedicated, 
      LLC (SLD), and its affiliated entities, subject to customary closing 
      conditions.
    

      “SLD’s strong customer base and strategically placed fulfillment centers 
      position us as a top national pool distribution services provider,” said 
      John Roberts, president and CEO of J.B. Hunt. “This acquisition will 
      also allow our customers to deploy ‘big and bulky’ inventories into key 
      markets, improving order fulfillment times for Final Mile deliveries and 
      further enhancing our e-commerce delivery capabilities. We are excited 
      to welcome the employees, customers, and carriers of SLD to J.B. Hunt.”
    

      The purchase price is $136 million with no assumption of debt. J.B. Hunt 
      anticipates using its existing revolving credit facility to finance this 
      transaction and to provide liquidity for future operations. The 
      transaction is not expected to have a significant impact on interest 
      expense. Preliminary valuations indicate an incremental amortization 
      expense between $7 million and $10 million annually. J.B. Hunt expects 
      the transaction to be immaterial to 2017 operating results and accretive 
      in 2018.
    

      Based in Houston, SLD provides pool distribution services throughout 
      North America using 14 terminals and fulfillment centers and a fleet of 
      over 850 pieces of equipment. Service offerings include dedicated 
      transportation at both dedicated and multi-use sites; cross-docking and 
      contract logistics; less-than-truckload product consolidation; 
      commingled pool distribution; and a Texas-based intrastate 57’ dry van 
      highway service.

J.B. Hunt Transport Services (NASDAQ:JBHT)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



      J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (NASDAQ: JBHT), one of the largest 
      supply chain solutions providers in North America, today announced it 
      has entered into an agreement to acquire Special Logistics Dedicated, 
      LLC (SLD), and its affiliated entities, subject to customary closing 
      conditions.
    

      “SLD’s strong customer base and strategically placed fulfillment centers 
      position us as a top national pool distribution services provider,” said 
      John Roberts, president and CEO of J.B. Hunt. “This acquisition will 
      also allow our customers to deploy ‘big and bulky’ inventories into key 
      markets, improving order fulfillment times for Final Mile deliveries and 
      further enhancing our e-commerce delivery capabilities. We are excited 
      to welcome the employees, customers, and carriers of SLD to J.B. Hunt.”
    

      The purchase price is $136 million with no assumption of debt. J.B. Hunt 
      anticipates using its existing revolving credit facility to finance this 
      transaction and to provide liquidity for future operations. The 
      transaction is not expected to have a significant impact on interest 
      expense. Preliminary valuations indicate an incremental amortization 
      expense between $7 million and $10 million annually. J.B. Hunt expects 
      the transaction to be immaterial to 2017 operating results and accretive 
      in 2018.
    

      Based in Houston, SLD provides pool distribution services throughout 
      North America using 14 terminals and fulfillment centers and a fleet of 
      over 850 pieces of equipment. Service offerings include dedicated 
      transportation at both dedicated and multi-use sites; cross-docking and 
      contract logistics; less-than-truckload product consolidation; 
      commingled pool distribution; and a Texas-based intrastate 57’ dry van 
      highway service.

Publicly traded logistics company J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. of Lowell said Friday that it has agreed to buy Special Logistics Dedicated LLC of Houston for $136 million.
In a news release, the company said the move will expand its e-commerce delivery platform.
"SLD`s strong customer base and strategically placed fulfillment centers position us as a top national pool distribution services provider," John Roberts, J.B. Hunt`s president and CEO, said in a news release. "This acquisition will also allow our customers to deploy `big and bulky` inventories into key markets, improving order fulfillment times for Final Mile deliveries and further enhancing our e-commerce delivery capabilities. We are excited to welcome the employees, customers, and carriers of SLD to J.B. Hunt."
There is no assumption of debt in the deal, and J.B. Hunt said it will use its existing revolving credit facility to finance this transaction "and to provide liquidity for future operations." The company expects the deal to be immaterial to 2017 operating results and accretive in 2018.
SLD provides pool distribution services throughout North America using 14 terminals and fulfillment centers and a fleet of more than 850 pieces of equipment. Services include dedicated transportation at both dedicated and multi-use sites; cross-docking and contract logistics; less-than-truckload product consolidation; commingled pool distribution; and a Texas-based intrastate 57` dry van highway service.
Earlier this week, J.B. Hunt posted second-quarter net income of $97.9 million, down nearly 7 percent from the same quarter last year.(c) APS  2017.
