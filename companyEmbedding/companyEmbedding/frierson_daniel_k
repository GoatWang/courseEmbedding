This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

            Dixie: Strong at 94

[Dalton] Acquisitions, new and wide selection of product and its high-end positioning drove growth at The Dixie Group (TDG) for the last decade, allowing it to recover and thrive sooner than perhaps other carpet firms.
“We recovered more quickly because we were positioned at the higher end and, even during the worst of the downturn, we were investing in new products,” Daniel K. Frierson, chairman and CEO told FCW. “Retailers want more choices and we do a good job of offering retailers more. On the commercial side, we also offer more options to specifiers.” Dixie also maintains significant inventory so that it can deliver what its dealers need quickly.
With a history that began in 1920, TDG continues to grow and thrive through its ability to evolve to suit changes in environment. Made up of Dixie Home, Masland Residential, Fabrica and Masland Contract, increased TDG’s carpet sales grew 68 percent from 2009 through 2013, as reported in last year’s annual report. Residential carpet sales were up 88 percent, while commercial sales grew 28 percent. The growth was driven by extensive investment in “product, processes and people,” said Daniel Frierson.
Once the recovery started, Dixie began to look for acquisition opportunities and has made key additions every year since 2012. “There were no prospects from 2003 until 2012,” noted Kennedy Frierson, vice president and COO. “But in the last two and half years, opportunities have come and we have taken advantage of them. We wanted to be differentiated across the commercial and residential markets. In late 2012, we purchased Colormaster, a continuous dye operation, and Crown Rugs. We moved the Crown Rugs business to California and merged it into Masland Residential.” 
In 2013, Dixie purchased Robertex, a manufacturer of tufted wool carpets with skein dyeing facilities. The acquisition included Carousel Carpet, which had been acquired by Robertex in 2010. “Robertex was a good fit with Dixie’s complimentary strengths because we have the marketing and sales network,” Kennedy Frierson explained. “Robertex is sold through Masland and within the next 12 to 18 months, the Robertex brand will transition to Masland,” he added. 
Also in 2013, Dixie entered agreements with Desso, a major European manufacturer of broadloom and modular carpet, based in the Netherlands. “The two companies, which have complementary strengths, began working together in October 2013,” said Kennedy Frierson. “We have a hospitality joint venture that combines Desso’s woven Axminster products with tufted products from Masland Hospitality that also includes some printed broadloom lines. Dixie and Desso sales teams are selling the products together for a complete package,” he said. 
Desso, a leading modular tile supplier in Europe, did not have distribution in the U.S. Its second agreement with Dixie has the Masland Contract sales force selling a selection of Desso modular tile products. “Some of the products are very ‘green’,” Kennedy Frierson said. “Masland is about design excellence while Desso has technical expertise,” Kennedy Frierson stated. 
Looking for a way to grow its commercial business internally, Dixie launched Avant Carpet, a new brand, in 2013. Looking to fill a need for a more fashion brand, some Avant products launched in 2013, but more are being introduced this year. Kennedy Frierson said, “We have built a sales force from agents already in the marketplace to cover the U.S. and Canada.” 
In March of this year, Dixie acquired Atlas Carpets. “It fits the Dixie culture and position in the commercial market,” said Kennedy Frierson. Both companies are style driven. For the most part, Atlas continues to operate as it did before the acquisition, but its dyeing operations have been consolidated into Dixie’s Susan Street (Fabrica) facility located in Santa Ana, Calif. “Our plan is to leverage Atlas design strengths with Dixie’s manufacturing capabilities to be able to bring its high-fashion products to market with better price points,” said Kennedy Frierson. “Atlas has a very strong sales force and excellent brand equity in the market place, which should maximize our opportunities for growth. 
Investments in equipment and services are also ongoing. “We have increased yarn production by 40 percent,” Kennedy Frierson said, adding, “We reopened tufting in Eton, Ga. in 2012. We ran out of capacity at Colormaster, so we are also continuing to invest in dyeing capacity. We also ran out of space for distribution, so are leasing space in Adairsville, Ga. and are moving the residential products to that facility.”
An essential part of Dixie’s position in residential carpet is its continuing partnership with Stainmaster. Daniel Frierson explained that Dixie had been a manufacturer partner with DuPont during its textile days and is now committed to Invista for branded nylon 6,6 — Stainmaster for residential and Antron for commercial. “Invista has the most stylish yarns for differentiated, beautiful carpet,” stressed Daniel Frierson.
Going forward, Dixie will continue to be open to opportunities, but is not planning any new acquisitions soon. “Right now, we need to absorb and stream line all operations to take top line growth to the bottom line,” said Kennedy Frierson. 

The Frierson tenure at Dixie
While the Frierson family has never been sole owner of Dixie, the two names have a long history. J. Burton Frierson, Daniel Frierson’s father, joined the original Dixie in 1925 and in 1935 he became a co-owner of the business. 
J. Burton Frierson was active in the business until he retired in the 1980s. Daniel Frierson joined Dixie in 1966 after graduating from the University of Virginia. “I worked every job in the plant and operations at first,” he recalled. “I started working in Dalton in the Candlewick carpet yarn business in the 1970s and then became CEO of Dixie in 1980 and chairman in 1986.” 
Dixie held its first public trade offering in the mid-1980s. Daniel Frierson explained that today the Frierson family has significant investments in Dixie and voting control over the management of the company. 
Kennedy Frierson, the third generation, spent some time in Chicago after graduating from Princeton in 1989, where he earned a Master’s degree and CPA from DePaul University. “In 1992, He came to work in Dixie’s textile business but when we sold that in the 1996, he went back to school for a graduate degree in business and rejoined the company in 1998. Since then, Kennedy Frierson has served as president of Masland Residential, general manager of Dixie Home, president of Bretlin as well as other positions in operations, sales and senior management. He was named vice president and COO in 2009 and became director in 20013.

​ Kennedy Frierson and Dan Frierson are pleased with Dixie’s growth.
