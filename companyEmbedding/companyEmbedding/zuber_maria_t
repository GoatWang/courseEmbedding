Education and professional work[edit]
Zuber received her B.A. in astronomy and geology from the University of Pennsylvania. She also earned Sc.M. and Ph.D. degrees, both in geophysics, from Brown University. Zuber later worked at Johns Hopkins University and served as a research scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. She joined the faculty of MIT in 1998 and was the chair of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences from 2003 to 2012.[1] She is the first woman to lead a science department at MIT.[2] Since 2012, she has been Vice President for Research at MIT.[3]
Zuber's professional focus has been on the structure and tectonics of solid solar system objects. She specializes in using gravity and laser altimetry measurements to determine interior structure and evolution. She has been a team member on 10 NASA planetary missions, including Mars Global Surveyor, Dawn, and MESSENGER.[1][4]
Zuber became interested in planetary science at an early age. A desire to spread her childhood enthusiasm was one reason why she teamed up with former astronaut Sally Ride to include in the GRAIL mission components that would capture the imagination of young students. A student contest provided the names for the mission's two spacecraft, Ebb and Flow, and students can sign up to use GRAIL's Moon Knowledge Acquired by Middle school students (MoonKAM) instrument.[2][5]
Zuber is a member of the following professional societies:[1]

American Geophysical Union
American Association for the Advancement of Science
American Astronomical Society, Division for Planetary Sciences
American Astronautical Society
Geological Society of America

Honors and awards[edit]
Zuber was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal in 2004.[1] In 2008, Zuber received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Brown University. Later that year, along with Fiona Harrison, a physics professor at the California Institute of Technology, she was named as one of America's Best Leaders by U.S. News & World Report.[6] Zuber and Harrison were the first two women to be selected as scientific leaders of NASA robotic missions.

PROVIDENCE, R.I.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Textron Inc. (NYSE: TXT) announced that Dr. Maria T. Zuber has been 
      elected to the company's Board of Directors, effective November 1, 2016. 
      Dr. Zuber is the Vice President for Research and the E. A. Griswold 
      Professor of Geophysics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
      She is also currently the Chair of the National Science Board.
    


      "We are honored to welcome Dr. Zuber to our Board," said Textron 
      Chairman and CEO Scott Donnelly. "Her research experience and knowledge 
      of emerging technologies will provide invaluable support for our 
      company’s product development activities. We are fortunate to have a 
      scientist of such prominence helping to shape our company's strategic 
      direction," Donnelly added.
    

      In her role as Vice President for Research, to which she was appointed 
      in 2013, Dr. Zuber has overall responsibility for research 
      administration and policy at MIT, overseeing MIT Lincoln Laboratory and 
      more than a dozen interdisciplinary research laboratories and centers, 
      and plays a central role in research relationships with the federal 
      government. Dr. Zuber served as the Head of the Department of Earth, 
      Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT from 2003-2011. Since 1990, 
      she has held leadership roles associated with scientific experiments or 
      instrumentation on nine NASA missions, notably serving as Principal 
      Investigator for NASA's Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) 
      mission, an effort to map the Moon's gravitational field. In 2013, 
      President Obama appointed Dr. Zuber to the National Science Board, and, 
      in May 2016, she was elected Board Chair.
    

      Dr. Zuber has won numerous awards including the MIT James R. Killian Jr. 
      Faculty Achievement Award, NASA's Outstanding Scientific Achievement 
      Medal, Distinguished Public Service Medal and Outstanding Public 
      Leadership Medal, as well as the American Geophysical Union Harry H. 
      Hess Medal, the Geological Society of America G. K. Gilbert Award and 
      the American Astronautical Society/Planetary Society Carl Sagan Memorial 
      Award. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and American 
      Philosophical Society, and is a fellow for the American Academy of Arts 
      and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 
      the Geological Society and the American Geophysical Union. Dr. Zuber 
      also serves on the Board of Fellows of Brown University.
    

      In 2004, President Bush appointed her to the Presidential Commission on 
      the Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy. In 2002, 
      Discover magazine named her one of the 50 most important women in 
      science and, in 2008, she was named to the USNews/Harvard Kennedy School 
      List of America's Best Leaders. Dr. Zuber received her B.A. in astronomy 
      and geology from the University of Pennsylvania. She also earned Sc.M. 
      and Ph.D. degrees, both in geophysics, from Brown University.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Maria T. Zuber



Zuber speaking at the GRAIL MoonKAM Student Expo in 2012



Born
(1958-06-27) June 27, 1958 (age 59)
Norristown, Pennsylvania, U.S.


Nationality
American


Fields
Planetary Science


Institutions
Massachusetts Institute of Technology


Alma mater
University of Pennsylvania, Brown University


Doctoral advisor
Marc Parmentier


Known for
Work on NASA remote-sensing missions; Principal investigator for the GRAIL mission


Notable awards
NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal


Maria T. Zuber (born June 27, 1958) is a member of the National Science Board and the Vice President for Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she also holds the position of the E. A. Griswold Professor of Geophysics in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences.[1] Zuber has been involved in more than half a dozen NASA planetary missions aimed at mapping the Moon, Mars, Mercury, and several asteroids. She is currently the principal investigator for the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) Mission, which is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.[2]

Education and professional work[edit]
Zuber received her B.A. in astronomy and geology from the University of Pennsylvania. She also earned Sc.M. and Ph.D. degrees, both in geophysics, from Brown University. Zuber later worked at Johns Hopkins University and served as a research scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. She joined the faculty of MIT in 1998 and was the chair of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences from 2003 to 2012.[1] She is the first woman to lead a science department at MIT.[2] Since 2012, she has been Vice President for Research at MIT.[3]
Zuber's professional focus has been on the structure and tectonics of solid solar system objects. She specializes in using gravity and laser altimetry measurements to determine interior structure and evolution. She has been a team member on 10 NASA planetary missions, including Mars Global Surveyor, Dawn, and MESSENGER.[1][4]
Zuber became interested in planetary science at an early age. A desire to spread her childhood enthusiasm was one reason why she teamed up with former astronaut Sally Ride to include in the GRAIL mission components that would capture the imagination of young students. A student contest provided the names for the mission's two spacecraft, Ebb and Flow, and students can sign up to use GRAIL's Moon Knowledge Acquired by Middle school students (MoonKAM) instrument.[2][5]
Zuber is a member of the following professional societies:[1]

American Geophysical Union
American Association for the Advancement of Science
American Astronomical Society, Division for Planetary Sciences
American Astronautical Society
Geological Society of America

Honors and awards[edit]
Zuber was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal in 2004.[1] In 2008, Zuber received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Brown University. Later that year, along with Fiona Harrison, a physics professor at the California Institute of Technology, she was named as one of America's Best Leaders by U.S. News & World Report.[6] Zuber and Harrison were the first two women to be selected as scientific leaders of NASA robotic missions.

Education and professional work[edit]
Zuber received her B.A. in astronomy and geology from the University of Pennsylvania. She also earned Sc.M. and Ph.D. degrees, both in geophysics, from Brown University. Zuber later worked at Johns Hopkins University and served as a research scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland. She joined the faculty of MIT in 1998 and was the chair of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences from 2003 to 2012.[1] She is the first woman to lead a science department at MIT.[2] Since 2012, she has been Vice President for Research at MIT.[3]
Zuber's professional focus has been on the structure and tectonics of solid solar system objects. She specializes in using gravity and laser altimetry measurements to determine interior structure and evolution. She has been a team member on 10 NASA planetary missions, including Mars Global Surveyor, Dawn, and MESSENGER.[1][4]
Zuber became interested in planetary science at an early age. A desire to spread her childhood enthusiasm was one reason why she teamed up with former astronaut Sally Ride to include in the GRAIL mission components that would capture the imagination of young students. A student contest provided the names for the mission's two spacecraft, Ebb and Flow, and students can sign up to use GRAIL's Moon Knowledge Acquired by Middle school students (MoonKAM) instrument.[2][5]
Zuber is a member of the following professional societies:[1]

American Geophysical Union
American Association for the Advancement of Science
American Astronomical Society, Division for Planetary Sciences
American Astronautical Society
Geological Society of America

Honors and awards[edit]
Zuber was awarded the NASA Distinguished Public Service Medal in 2004.[1] In 2008, Zuber received an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Brown University. Later that year, along with Fiona Harrison, a physics professor at the California Institute of Technology, she was named as one of America's Best Leaders by U.S. News & World Report.[6] Zuber and Harrison were the first two women to be selected as scientific leaders of NASA robotic missions.

(Joby Warrick/The Washington Post)   By Maria T. Zuber  By Maria T. Zuber  February 24      Maria T. Zuber is the vice president for research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Chair of the National Science Board.     I grew up in a place named for coal: Carbon County, Pa., where energy-rich anthracite coal was discovered in the late 1700s. By the early 1900s, eastern Pennsylvania employed more than 180,000 miners. By the 1970s — when I left Carbon County for college — just 2,000 of those jobs remained. For decades, my family’s path traced the arc of the industry. Both my grandfathers mined anthracite. My father’s father died of black lung before I was born. My mother’s father lived long enough to get a pink slip, teach himself to repair TVs and radios and finally get a job on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. He often slept in a recliner because he couldn’t breathe in bed. He had black lung, too. We faced economic challenges, but thanks to my father’s career as a state trooper, we had more security than most. Still, our neighbors’ struggles left a deep impression on me. When I hear coal-mining communities talk bitterly about a “war on coal,” I understand why they feel under attack. I know the deep anxiety born from years of watching their towns empty out and opportunity evaporate. I was one of the people who left, in my case to pursue my passion for science. I was lucky: I became the first woman to head a science department at MIT, as well as the first woman to lead a NASA planetary mission. As a daughter of coal country, I know the suffering of people whose fates are tied to the price of a ton of coal. But as a scientist, I know that we cannot repeal the laws of physics: When coal burns, it emits more carbon dioxide than any other fossil fuel. And if we keep emitting this gas into the atmosphere, Earth will continue to heat up, imposing devastating risks on current and future generations. There is no escaping these facts, just as there is no escaping gravity if you step off a ledge. The move to clean energy is imperative. In the long run, that transition will create more jobs than it destroys. But that is no comfort to families whose livelihoods and communities have collapsed along with the demand for coal. We owe something to the people who do the kind of dangerous and difficult work my grandfathers did so that we can power our modern economy. Fortunately, there are ways we can declare war on coal’s carbon emissions without declaring war on coal communities. First, we should aggressively pursue carbon capture and storage technology, which catches carbon dioxide from coal power plants before it is released into the atmosphere and stores it underground. To be practical, advances in capture efficiency must be coupled with dramatic decreases in deployment costs and an understanding of the environmental impacts of storage. These are not intractable problems; scientific and technological innovations could change the game. Next, we should look beyond combustion and steel production to find new ways to make coal useful. In 2015, 91 percent of coal use was for electrical power. But researchers are exploring whether coal can be used more widely as a material for the production of carbon fiber, batteries and electronics — indeed, even solar panels. These avenues hold promise, but even if carbon capture becomes practicable and we expand other uses for coal, the industry will never come roaring back. Globally, coal’s market share is dropping, driven by a range of factors, including cheap natural gas and the rapidly declining costs of wind and solar energy. That’s why we must also commit to helping the workers and communities that are hurt when coal mines and coal plants reduce their operations or shut down. Policymakers, researchers and advocates have proposed a range of solutions at the federal and state levels to promote economic development; help coal workers transition to jobs in other industries, including renewable energy; and maintain benefits for retired coal workers. Helping coal country is an issue with bipartisan support. Still, to succeed, strategies such as these may require a champion who, like President Trump, has widespread support in coal country and can address skepticism from coal communities.  Eventually, the practice of burning coal and other fossil fuels for energy — especially without the use of carbon capture and storage technologies — will end. It has to. The question is whether we have the wisdom to end it in an orderly way that addresses the pain of coal communities — and quickly enough to prevent the worst impacts of climate change. Our choices will determine the future not just for coal country, but for all of us.   Read more:   Michael E.

      "We are honored to welcome Dr. Zuber to our Board," said Textron
      Chairman and CEO Scott Donnelly. "Her research experience and knowledge
      of emerging technologies will provide invaluable support for our
      company’s product development activities. We are fortunate to have a
      scientist of such prominence helping to shape our company's strategic
      direction," Donnelly added.
    

      In her role as Vice President for Research, to which she was appointed
      in 2013, Dr. Zuber has overall responsibility for research
      administration and policy at MIT, overseeing MIT Lincoln Laboratory and
      more than a dozen interdisciplinary research laboratories and centers,
      and plays a central role in research relationships with the federal
      government. Dr. Zuber served as the Head of the Department of Earth,
      Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT from 2003-2011. Since 1990,
      she has held leadership roles associated with scientific experiments or
      instrumentation on nine NASA missions, notably serving as Principal
      Investigator for NASA's Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL)
      mission, an effort to map the Moon's gravitational field. In 2013,
      President Obama appointed Dr. Zuber to the National Science Board, and,
      in May 2016, she was elected Board Chair.
    

      Dr. Zuber has won numerous awards including the MIT James R. Killian Jr.
      Faculty Achievement Award, NASA's Outstanding Scientific Achievement
      Medal, Distinguished Public Service Medal and Outstanding Public
      Leadership Medal, as well as the American Geophysical Union Harry H.
      Hess Medal, the Geological Society of America G. K. Gilbert Award and
      the American Astronautical Society/Planetary Society Carl Sagan Memorial
      Award. She is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and American
      Philosophical Society, and is a fellow for the American Academy of Arts
      and Sciences, the American Association for the Advancement of Science,
      the Geological Society and the American Geophysical Union. Dr. Zuber
      also serves on the Board of Fellows of Brown University.
    

      In 2004, President Bush appointed her to the Presidential Commission on
      the Implementation of United States Space Exploration Policy. In 2002,
      Discover magazine named her one of the 50 most important women in
      science and, in 2008, she was named to the USNews/Harvard Kennedy School
      List of America's Best Leaders. Dr. Zuber received her B.A. in astronomy
      and geology from the University of Pennsylvania. She also earned Sc.M.
      and Ph.D. degrees, both in geophysics, from Brown University.
