Bourbon brands aren't usually trending topics on Twitter and Facebook, nor do they often make the nightly news. But such was the case back in 2013 when 68 cases of the legendary Pappy Van Winkle were stolen. The Kentucky-based company was trending again last year when authorities took down a softball-playin', gun-totin', steroid-traffickin', organized crime ring and retrieved some of that stolen hooch. And here we find ourselves this week, talking about Pappy Van Winkle once more.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowFirst came the news that the Franklin County Sheriff's Office would be auctioning off 28 of the recovered bottles. (Everyone celebrated!) Now comes the sad news that the Van Winkle family has asked a judge to have those bottles destroyed. And everyone cried, "WHY?!"Yet, I can't help thinking: All this talk over 28 measly bottles?Of course, this is no ordinary bourbon. Pappy Van Winkle has become the most famous whiskey in America, a unicorn unseen on store shelves for years, untasted by the vast majority of humans, and sold for astronomical sums on the secondary market. Those 28 bottles have a retail value of around $3,000 and a secondary value of perhaps $20,000, depending on age. That may sound like a lot, but it's not. I wouldn't be surprised if Buffalo Trace—the distiller of the Van Winkle line—washes that much whiskey down the drain every week.
Most PopularSo what's the big deal?"The whiskey lovers boo and the conspiracy theorists say the Van Winkles are loving the attention…again," explained acclaimed bourbon writer Fred Minnick.The Van Winkles are, if anything, masters at getting and then keeping their name (and their eponymous bourbon's name) in the headlines. I'm not claiming Julian Van Winkle III—grandson of Pappy and president of the Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery (note: not an actual distillery)—orchestrated this theft. But the outspoken man and his famed family have yet again taken a minor story and managed to keep it in the news cycle all week long.As always, these Pappy tales have absolutely nothing to do with the actual taste of the products. (My reviews: Pappy 15 Year is as world-class as bourbon comes, while the 20 and 23 Years suffer from an over-woodiness.) Instead, the story once again is about how rare this product is—though really not that rare, with about 100,000 bottles produced per year—and how every bottle lost is yet another bottle you will likely never taste.Of course, we can't ignore the fact that no one knows what the hell happened to those 28 bottles while they were out of Buffalo Trace's control."Where is the precedent for a sheriff's department auctioning alcohol or a controlled substance?" Minnick added, believing the bourbon should be destroyed. "How do we know the steroid-slinging, child porn-having criminals didn't tamper with the whiskey?"It's a valid point. Still, destroy it or not, I would bet the Van Winkles don't really care what happens to these 28 bottles. It won't affect their bottom line nor the perceived quality of their product. But ultimately, it will have more people writing about their bourbon, and arguing about it, and wondering just how good it truly is, and ultimately coveting it even more than they already do.Pappy Van Winkle may have been a great bourbon maker, but his grandson continues to be the P.T. Barnum of bourbon myth-making.More from Esquire:

Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve is the flagship brand of bourbon whiskey owned by the "Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery" company (which does not actually own or operate a distillery, but rather has it produced under a contract with another company). It is distilled and bottled by the Sazerac Company at its Buffalo Trace Distillery in Frankfort, Kentucky.[1] Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve is often regarded as one of the finest bourbons in the world, and is rare to find on the market due to its very low production and high demand.[2][3][4][5][6]

History[edit]
In 1893, when he was 18 years old, Julian "Pappy" Van Winkle, Sr. began working as a salesman for the liquor wholesaler, W.L. Weller & Sons. Fifteen years later, he and another Weller salesman bought the firm. In 1910 they acquired the A. Ph. Stitzel Distillery in Louisville, Kentucky, which had started as a sour mash whiskey distillery in 1872.[7]
The Stitzel Distillery supplied much of the whiskey sold by the Weller wholesale firm. The consolidation coincided with prohibition, during which time the Stitzel-Weller firm was licensed by the government to produce whiskey for medicinal purposes. One of their labels that was introduced on the market just before prohibition was Old Rip Van Winkle.[1] After prohibition, the brand was not reintroduced until after 1972 when the Stitzel-Weller distillery and its current brand names (including W.L. Weller, Old Fitzgerald, Rebel Yell, and Cabin Still) were sold to other companies.[1] The only brand name the Van Winkle family kept the rights to was the pre-prohibition brand Old Rip Van Winkle.[1]
The Stitzel-Weller Distillery was opened on the day of the Kentucky Derby in 1935, just outside Louisville in Shively, Kentucky. At the time of his death in 1965 at the age of 89, Pappy Van Winkle was the oldest active distiller in the nation. A photo of him graces the bottle's label.[3][8][9]
Sometime after the Stitzel-Weller distillery was sold in 1972, Julian Van Winkle, Jr. resurrected the pre-prohibition Old Rip Van Winkle brand and initially used old whiskey stocks from the distillery for its bottlings.[1] Julian Jr. died in 1981 and Julian Van Winkle, III (Pappy's grandson)[10] took over the Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery company.
After the initial sale in 1972, the Stitzel-Weller distillery was eventually closed completely in 1991.[11] In 1984, Buffalo Trace distillery commercially marketed the first modern (post-1950s) brand of single-barrel bourbon, Blanton's.[3]
Since 2002, the Van Winkle brands have been distilled and bottled by the Sazerac Company at the Buffalo Trace Distillery as a joint venture with the Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery company.[1]
In 2013, Julian Preston Van Winkle III, said the 2013 bottlings of the 23-year brand expression "may be the last of its kind", since at that point there was very little left of the aging stock from the Stitzel-Weller distillery (although he said the brand would not be discontinued).[7][12] The makers say that they do not want to boost production, as there is considerable long term risk, and they do not want to be left holding copious quantities of unsaleable bourbon should tastes, fashions or circumstances change.[13]
Production is being increased somewhat, with a projected increase of the annual production from the current 6–8 thousand bottles to 15 thousand by 2025, but the production will remain well below mass-market levels.[6]
Popularity among Bourbon enthusiasts[edit]
The product has a cult-like following.[14][15] Famous chefs such as Anthony Bourdain and David Chang have favored the product.[2] Food Republic reported that Chef John Currence said: "There's Pappy Van Winkle, then there's everything else."[15] Bourbon aficionados have shown up in droves to get a small chance in a lottery to purchase some.[16][17] It has been called "the bourbon everyone wants but no one can get".[2] A writer for The Wall Street Journal said "You could call it bourbon, or you could call it a $5,000 bottle of liquified, barrel-aged unobtanium."[5][13] Jen Doll wrote in The Wire, "It's an age-old dilemma (supply and demand) leading to an age-old marketing dream (a product that can't be kept on the shelves ... money in the pockets ... bourbon in the bourbon snifters)."[2][4][13]
According to Fox News and Maxim, PVW-23 is said to be one of the most expensive bourbons.[18]
Style[edit]
Like all modern bourbons, Van Winkle bourbons are made primarily from corn and aged in charred new oak barrels. A distinguishing feature of Van Winkle bourbons is their use of wheat as the secondary ingredient instead of the usual rye, and their additional inclusion of barley malt.
Pappy Van Winkle is aged for 15, 20 or 23 years, which is considerably longer than the aging period for most bourbons. The 20 year is bottled at 90.4 U.S. proof (45.2% alcohol by volume)[9] and has been described as "intensely fruity".[3] The 15 year is bottled at 107 proof.[19] The 23 year is bottled at 95.6 proof.[3]
Awards[edit]
Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve has won various awards.[1][20]

Pappy Van Winkle 20 Year Old Family Reserve won a Double Gold Medal at the 2014 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.[1][20]
Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve 23 Year Old Bourbon was named "Spirit of the Year" for 2010 by Wine & Spirits magazine in its annual buying guide issue.[21]
The 20 Year Old Special Reserve was recognized with the "Trophy for Worldwide Whisky" and a Best-In-Class Gold Medallion in the 2008 International Wine and Spirit Competition.[22] It received a score of 99 ("superlative") from the Beverage Testing Institute in the same year.[22]
"A rating from the Beverage Testing Institute created the Pappy frenzy." The 99 rating for the 20-year Pappy Van Winkle was the highest rating ever. Thus, Pappy "was rescued from schmaltzy marketing hell and exploded into the cult it is today."[6]

Limited edition decanter[edit]
The Van Winkles released a special limited edition decanter set of specially selected Old Rip Van Winkle 23 year old, 114 proof Van Winkle bourbon barreled in the spring of 1986.[23]
2013 theft[edit]
In mid-October 2013 the company reported the theft of 65 three-bottle cases of Pappy Van Winkle 20 Year and nine three-bottle cases of 13-year-old Van Winkle Family Reserve rye.[3][8][24] Police theorized that it took the thief about two months to complete the heist, and noted that whoever did it avoided being recorded by security cameras.[14]
On Monday December 2, Sheriff Melton announced a $10,000 reward to anyone who could give information that leads to a conviction in the case. $1,000 of this reward money was offered by Bluegrass Crimestoppers and the other $9,000 by an anonymous donor.[25]
A break in the case came in March 2014 when a Buffalo Trace employee was arrested by Franklin County authorities when five barrels of stolen Wild Turkey bourbon were found on his property. On April 21, 2015 nine Kentucky residents, three of whom were employees at both Wild Turkey and Buffalo Trace, were indicted for thefts at the Buffalo Trace and Wild Turkey distilleries dating back to 2008. Over $100,000 worth of the stolen whiskey was recovered, including more than two dozen bottles of Pappy Van Winkle and 15 barrels of Wild Turkey.[26] The Van Winkle family has stated that the stolen whiskey should be destroyed as a precaution against tampering or contamination, pending the approval of the judge.[27][28][29]
The heists included Pappy Van Winkle (more than 20 cases), 50 to 70 cases of Eagle Rare bourbon, and stolen barrels of other whiskey that are still missing. The warrants recovered one barrel of 17-year-old Eagle Rare worth more than $11,000.[30][31] All nine defendants are charged with being members of a criminal syndicate, engaging in organized crime.[32]
Forgeries and counterfeit bourbon[edit]
Empty bottles have turned up on eBay at extravagant prices. It turns out that the bottles are being recycled, refilled with counterfeit bourbon and sold as true Pappy.[33]

Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve is the flagship brand of bourbon whiskey owned by the "Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery" company (which does not actually own or operate a distillery, but rather has it produced under a contract with another company). It is distilled and bottled by the Sazerac Company at its Buffalo Trace Distillery in Frankfort, Kentucky.[1] Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve is often regarded as one of the finest bourbons in the world, and is rare to find on the market due to its very low production and high demand.[2][3][4][5][6]

History[edit]
In 1893, when he was 18 years old, Julian "Pappy" Van Winkle, Sr. began working as a salesman for the liquor wholesaler, W.L. Weller & Sons. Fifteen years later, he and another Weller salesman bought the firm. In 1910 they acquired the A. Ph. Stitzel Distillery in Louisville, Kentucky, which had started as a sour mash whiskey distillery in 1872.[7]
The Stitzel Distillery supplied much of the whiskey sold by the Weller wholesale firm. The consolidation coincided with prohibition, during which time the Stitzel-Weller firm was licensed by the government to produce whiskey for medicinal purposes. One of their labels that was introduced on the market just before prohibition was Old Rip Van Winkle.[1] After prohibition, the brand was not reintroduced until after 1972 when the Stitzel-Weller distillery and its current brand names (including W.L. Weller, Old Fitzgerald, Rebel Yell, and Cabin Still) were sold to other companies.[1] The only brand name the Van Winkle family kept the rights to was the pre-prohibition brand Old Rip Van Winkle.[1]
The Stitzel-Weller Distillery was opened on the day of the Kentucky Derby in 1935, just outside Louisville in Shively, Kentucky. At the time of his death in 1965 at the age of 89, Pappy Van Winkle was the oldest active distiller in the nation. A photo of him graces the bottle's label.[3][8][9]
Sometime after the Stitzel-Weller distillery was sold in 1972, Julian Van Winkle, Jr. resurrected the pre-prohibition Old Rip Van Winkle brand and initially used old whiskey stocks from the distillery for its bottlings.[1] Julian Jr. died in 1981 and Julian Van Winkle, III (Pappy's grandson)[10] took over the Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery company.
After the initial sale in 1972, the Stitzel-Weller distillery was eventually closed completely in 1991.[11] In 1984, Buffalo Trace distillery commercially marketed the first modern (post-1950s) brand of single-barrel bourbon, Blanton's.[3]
Since 2002, the Van Winkle brands have been distilled and bottled by the Sazerac Company at the Buffalo Trace Distillery as a joint venture with the Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery company.[1]
In 2013, Julian Preston Van Winkle III, said the 2013 bottlings of the 23-year brand expression "may be the last of its kind", since at that point there was very little left of the aging stock from the Stitzel-Weller distillery (although he said the brand would not be discontinued).[7][12] The makers say that they do not want to boost production, as there is considerable long term risk, and they do not want to be left holding copious quantities of unsaleable bourbon should tastes, fashions or circumstances change.[13]
Production is being increased somewhat, with a projected increase of the annual production from the current 6–8 thousand bottles to 15 thousand by 2025, but the production will remain well below mass-market levels.[6]
Popularity among Bourbon enthusiasts[edit]
The product has a cult-like following.[14][15] Famous chefs such as Anthony Bourdain and David Chang have favored the product.[2] Food Republic reported that Chef John Currence said: "There's Pappy Van Winkle, then there's everything else."[15] Bourbon aficionados have shown up in droves to get a small chance in a lottery to purchase some.[16][17] It has been called "the bourbon everyone wants but no one can get".[2] A writer for The Wall Street Journal said "You could call it bourbon, or you could call it a $5,000 bottle of liquified, barrel-aged unobtanium."[5][13] Jen Doll wrote in The Wire, "It's an age-old dilemma (supply and demand) leading to an age-old marketing dream (a product that can't be kept on the shelves ... money in the pockets ... bourbon in the bourbon snifters)."[2][4][13]
According to Fox News and Maxim, PVW-23 is said to be one of the most expensive bourbons.[18]
Style[edit]
Like all modern bourbons, Van Winkle bourbons are made primarily from corn and aged in charred new oak barrels. A distinguishing feature of Van Winkle bourbons is their use of wheat as the secondary ingredient instead of the usual rye, and their additional inclusion of barley malt.
Pappy Van Winkle is aged for 15, 20 or 23 years, which is considerably longer than the aging period for most bourbons. The 20 year is bottled at 90.4 U.S. proof (45.2% alcohol by volume)[9] and has been described as "intensely fruity".[3] The 15 year is bottled at 107 proof.[19] The 23 year is bottled at 95.6 proof.[3]
Awards[edit]
Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve has won various awards.[1][20]

Pappy Van Winkle 20 Year Old Family Reserve won a Double Gold Medal at the 2014 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.[1][20]
Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve 23 Year Old Bourbon was named "Spirit of the Year" for 2010 by Wine & Spirits magazine in its annual buying guide issue.[21]
The 20 Year Old Special Reserve was recognized with the "Trophy for Worldwide Whisky" and a Best-In-Class Gold Medallion in the 2008 International Wine and Spirit Competition.[22] It received a score of 99 ("superlative") from the Beverage Testing Institute in the same year.[22]
"A rating from the Beverage Testing Institute created the Pappy frenzy." The 99 rating for the 20-year Pappy Van Winkle was the highest rating ever. Thus, Pappy "was rescued from schmaltzy marketing hell and exploded into the cult it is today."[6]

Limited edition decanter[edit]
The Van Winkles released a special limited edition decanter set of specially selected Old Rip Van Winkle 23 year old, 114 proof Van Winkle bourbon barreled in the spring of 1986.[23]
2013 theft[edit]
In mid-October 2013 the company reported the theft of 65 three-bottle cases of Pappy Van Winkle 20 Year and nine three-bottle cases of 13-year-old Van Winkle Family Reserve rye.[3][8][24] Police theorized that it took the thief about two months to complete the heist, and noted that whoever did it avoided being recorded by security cameras.[14]
On Monday December 2, Sheriff Melton announced a $10,000 reward to anyone who could give information that leads to a conviction in the case. $1,000 of this reward money was offered by Bluegrass Crimestoppers and the other $9,000 by an anonymous donor.[25]
A break in the case came in March 2014 when a Buffalo Trace employee was arrested by Franklin County authorities when five barrels of stolen Wild Turkey bourbon were found on his property. On April 21, 2015 nine Kentucky residents, three of whom were employees at both Wild Turkey and Buffalo Trace, were indicted for thefts at the Buffalo Trace and Wild Turkey distilleries dating back to 2008. Over $100,000 worth of the stolen whiskey was recovered, including more than two dozen bottles of Pappy Van Winkle and 15 barrels of Wild Turkey.[26] The Van Winkle family has stated that the stolen whiskey should be destroyed as a precaution against tampering or contamination, pending the approval of the judge.[27][28][29]
The heists included Pappy Van Winkle (more than 20 cases), 50 to 70 cases of Eagle Rare bourbon, and stolen barrels of other whiskey that are still missing. The warrants recovered one barrel of 17-year-old Eagle Rare worth more than $11,000.[30][31] All nine defendants are charged with being members of a criminal syndicate, engaging in organized crime.[32]
Forgeries and counterfeit bourbon[edit]
Empty bottles have turned up on eBay at extravagant prices. It turns out that the bottles are being recycled, refilled with counterfeit bourbon and sold as true Pappy.[33]

The 20 year is bottled at 90.4 U.S. proof (45.2% alcohol by volume)[9] and has been described as "intensely fruity".[3] The 15 year is bottled at 107 proof.[19] The 23 year is bottled at 95.6 proof.[3]
Awards[edit]
Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve has won various awards.[1][20]

Pappy Van Winkle 20 Year Old Family Reserve won a Double Gold Medal at the 2014 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.[1][20]
Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve 23 Year Old Bourbon was named "Spirit of the Year" for 2010 by Wine & Spirits magazine in its annual buying guide issue.[21]
The 20 Year Old Special Reserve was recognized with the "Trophy for Worldwide Whisky" and a Best-In-Class Gold Medallion in the 2008 International Wine and Spirit Competition.[22] It received a score of 99 ("superlative") from the Beverage Testing Institute in the same year.[22]
"A rating from the Beverage Testing Institute created the Pappy frenzy." The 99 rating for the 20-year Pappy Van Winkle was the highest rating ever. Thus, Pappy "was rescued from schmaltzy marketing hell and exploded into the cult it is today."[6]

Limited edition decanter[edit]
The Van Winkles released a special limited edition decanter set of specially selected Old Rip Van Winkle 23 year old, 114 proof Van Winkle bourbon barreled in the spring of 1986.[23]
2013 theft[edit]
In mid-October 2013 the company reported the theft of 65 three-bottle cases of Pappy Van Winkle 20 Year and nine three-bottle cases of 13-year-old Van Winkle Family Reserve rye.[3][8][24] Police theorized that it took the thief about two months to complete the heist, and noted that whoever did it avoided being recorded by security cameras.[14]
On Monday December 2, Sheriff Melton announced a $10,000 reward to anyone who could give information that leads to a conviction in the case. $1,000 of this reward money was offered by Bluegrass Crimestoppers and the other $9,000 by an anonymous donor.[25]
A break in the case came in March 2014 when a Buffalo Trace employee was arrested by Franklin County authorities when five barrels of stolen Wild Turkey bourbon were found on his property. On April 21, 2015 nine Kentucky residents, three of whom were employees at both Wild Turkey and Buffalo Trace, were indicted for thefts at the Buffalo Trace and Wild Turkey distilleries dating back to 2008. Over $100,000 worth of the stolen whiskey was recovered, including more than two dozen bottles of Pappy Van Winkle and 15 barrels of Wild Turkey.[26] The Van Winkle family has stated that the stolen whiskey should be destroyed as a precaution against tampering or contamination, pending the approval of the judge.[27][28][29]
The heists included Pappy Van Winkle (more than 20 cases), 50 to 70 cases of Eagle Rare bourbon, and stolen barrels of other whiskey that are still missing. The warrants recovered one barrel of 17-year-old Eagle Rare worth more than $11,000.[30][31] All nine defendants are charged with being members of a criminal syndicate, engaging in organized crime.[32]
Forgeries and counterfeit bourbon[edit]
Empty bottles have turned up on eBay at extravagant prices. It turns out that the bottles are being recycled, refilled with counterfeit bourbon and sold as true Pappy.[33]

Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve is the flagship brand of bourbon whiskey owned by the "Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery" company (which does not actually own or operate a distillery, but rather has it produced under a contract with another company). It is distilled and bottled by the Sazerac Company at its Buffalo Trace Distillery in Frankfort, Kentucky.[1] Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve is often regarded as one of the finest bourbons in the world, and is rare to find on the market due to its very low production and high demand.[2][3][4][5][6]

History[edit]
In 1893, when he was 18 years old, Julian "Pappy" Van Winkle, Sr. began working as a salesman for the liquor wholesaler, W.L. Weller & Sons. Fifteen years later, he and another Weller salesman bought the firm. In 1910 they acquired the A. Ph. Stitzel Distillery in Louisville, Kentucky, which had started as a sour mash whiskey distillery in 1872.[7]
The Stitzel Distillery supplied much of the whiskey sold by the Weller wholesale firm. The consolidation coincided with prohibition, during which time the Stitzel-Weller firm was licensed by the government to produce whiskey for medicinal purposes. One of their labels that was introduced on the market just before prohibition was Old Rip Van Winkle.[1] After prohibition, the brand was not reintroduced until after 1972 when the Stitzel-Weller distillery and its current brand names (including W.L. Weller, Old Fitzgerald, Rebel Yell, and Cabin Still) were sold to other companies.[1] The only brand name the Van Winkle family kept the rights to was the pre-prohibition brand Old Rip Van Winkle.[1]
The Stitzel-Weller Distillery was opened on the day of the Kentucky Derby in 1935, just outside Louisville in Shively, Kentucky. At the time of his death in 1965 at the age of 89, Pappy Van Winkle was the oldest active distiller in the nation. A photo of him graces the bottle's label.[3][8][9]
Sometime after the Stitzel-Weller distillery was sold in 1972, Julian Van Winkle, Jr. resurrected the pre-prohibition Old Rip Van Winkle brand and initially used old whiskey stocks from the distillery for its bottlings.[1] Julian Jr. died in 1981 and Julian Van Winkle, III (Pappy's grandson)[10] took over the Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery company.
After the initial sale in 1972, the Stitzel-Weller distillery was eventually closed completely in 1991.[11] In 1984, Buffalo Trace distillery commercially marketed the first modern (post-1950s) brand of single-barrel bourbon, Blanton's.[3]
Since 2002, the Van Winkle brands have been distilled and bottled by the Sazerac Company at the Buffalo Trace Distillery as a joint venture with the Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery company.[1]
In 2013, Julian Preston Van Winkle III, said the 2013 bottlings of the 23-year brand expression "may be the last of its kind", since at that point there was very little left of the aging stock from the Stitzel-Weller distillery (although he said the brand would not be discontinued).[7][12] The makers say that they do not want to boost production, as there is considerable long term risk, and they do not want to be left holding copious quantities of unsaleable bourbon should tastes, fashions or circumstances change.[13]
Production is being increased somewhat, with a projected increase of the annual production from the current 6–8 thousand bottles to 15 thousand by 2025, but the production will remain well below mass-market levels.[6]
Popularity among Bourbon enthusiasts[edit]
The product has a cult-like following.[14][15] Famous chefs such as Anthony Bourdain and David Chang have favored the product.[2] Food Republic reported that Chef John Currence said: "There's Pappy Van Winkle, then there's everything else."[15] Bourbon aficionados have shown up in droves to get a small chance in a lottery to purchase some.[16][17] It has been called "the bourbon everyone wants but no one can get".[2] A writer for The Wall Street Journal said "You could call it bourbon, or you could call it a $5,000 bottle of liquified, barrel-aged unobtanium."[5][13] Jen Doll wrote in The Wire, "It's an age-old dilemma (supply and demand) leading to an age-old marketing dream (a product that can't be kept on the shelves ... money in the pockets ... bourbon in the bourbon snifters)."[2][4][13]
According to Fox News and Maxim, PVW-23 is said to be one of the most expensive bourbons.[18]
Style[edit]
Like all modern bourbons, Van Winkle bourbons are made primarily from corn and aged in charred new oak barrels. A distinguishing feature of Van Winkle bourbons is their use of wheat as the secondary ingredient instead of the usual rye, and their additional inclusion of barley malt.
Pappy Van Winkle is aged for 15, 20 or 23 years, which is considerably longer than the aging period for most bourbons. The 20 year is bottled at 90.4 U.S. proof (45.2% alcohol by volume)[9] and has been described as "intensely fruity".[3] The 15 year is bottled at 107 proof.[19] The 23 year is bottled at 95.6 proof.[3]
Awards[edit]
Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve has won various awards.[1][20]

Pappy Van Winkle 20 Year Old Family Reserve won a Double Gold Medal at the 2014 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.[1][20]
Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve 23 Year Old Bourbon was named "Spirit of the Year" for 2010 by Wine & Spirits magazine in its annual buying guide issue.[21]
The 20 Year Old Special Reserve was recognized with the "Trophy for Worldwide Whisky" and a Best-In-Class Gold Medallion in the 2008 International Wine and Spirit Competition.[22] It received a score of 99 ("superlative") from the Beverage Testing Institute in the same year.[22]
"A rating from the Beverage Testing Institute created the Pappy frenzy." The 99 rating for the 20-year Pappy Van Winkle was the highest rating ever. Thus, Pappy "was rescued from schmaltzy marketing hell and exploded into the cult it is today."[6]

Limited edition decanter[edit]
The Van Winkles released a special limited edition decanter set of specially selected Old Rip Van Winkle 23 year old, 114 proof Van Winkle bourbon barreled in the spring of 1986.[23]
2013 theft[edit]
In mid-October 2013 the company reported the theft of 65 three-bottle cases of Pappy Van Winkle 20 Year and nine three-bottle cases of 13-year-old Van Winkle Family Reserve rye.[3][8][24] Police theorized that it took the thief about two months to complete the heist, and noted that whoever did it avoided being recorded by security cameras.[14]
On Monday December 2, Sheriff Melton announced a $10,000 reward to anyone who could give information that leads to a conviction in the case. $1,000 of this reward money was offered by Bluegrass Crimestoppers and the other $9,000 by an anonymous donor.[25]
A break in the case came in March 2014 when a Buffalo Trace employee was arrested by Franklin County authorities when five barrels of stolen Wild Turkey bourbon were found on his property. On April 21, 2015 nine Kentucky residents, three of whom were employees at both Wild Turkey and Buffalo Trace, were indicted for thefts at the Buffalo Trace and Wild Turkey distilleries dating back to 2008. Over $100,000 worth of the stolen whiskey was recovered, including more than two dozen bottles of Pappy Van Winkle and 15 barrels of Wild Turkey.[26] The Van Winkle family has stated that the stolen whiskey should be destroyed as a precaution against tampering or contamination, pending the approval of the judge.[27][28][29]
The heists included Pappy Van Winkle (more than 20 cases), 50 to 70 cases of Eagle Rare bourbon, and stolen barrels of other whiskey that are still missing. The warrants recovered one barrel of 17-year-old Eagle Rare worth more than $11,000.[30][31] All nine defendants are charged with being members of a criminal syndicate, engaging in organized crime.[32]
Forgeries and counterfeit bourbon[edit]
Empty bottles have turned up on eBay at extravagant prices. It turns out that the bottles are being recycled, refilled with counterfeit bourbon and sold as true Pappy.[33]

One of their labels that was introduced on the market just before prohibition was Old Rip Van Winkle.[1] After prohibition, the brand was not reintroduced until after 1972 when the Stitzel-Weller distillery and its current brand names (including W.L. Weller, Old Fitzgerald, Rebel Yell, and Cabin Still) were sold to other companies.[1] The only brand name the Van Winkle family kept the rights to was the pre-prohibition brand Old Rip Van Winkle.[1]
The Stitzel-Weller Distillery was opened on the day of the Kentucky Derby in 1935, just outside Louisville in Shively, Kentucky. At the time of his death in 1965 at the age of 89, Pappy Van Winkle was the oldest active distiller in the nation. A photo of him graces the bottle's label.[3][8][9]
Sometime after the Stitzel-Weller distillery was sold in 1972, Julian Van Winkle, Jr. resurrected the pre-prohibition Old Rip Van Winkle brand and initially used old whiskey stocks from the distillery for its bottlings.[1] Julian Jr. died in 1981 and Julian Van Winkle, III (Pappy's grandson)[10] took over the Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery company.
After the initial sale in 1972, the Stitzel-Weller distillery was eventually closed completely in 1991.[11] In 1984, Buffalo Trace distillery commercially marketed the first modern (post-1950s) brand of single-barrel bourbon, Blanton's.[3]
Since 2002, the Van Winkle brands have been distilled and bottled by the Sazerac Company at the Buffalo Trace Distillery as a joint venture with the Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery company.[1]
In 2013, Julian Preston Van Winkle III, said the 2013 bottlings of the 23-year brand expression "may be the last of its kind", since at that point there was very little left of the aging stock from the Stitzel-Weller distillery (although he said the brand would not be discontinued).[7][12] The makers say that they do not want to boost production, as there is considerable long term risk, and they do not want to be left holding copious quantities of unsaleable bourbon should tastes, fashions or circumstances change.[13]
Production is being increased somewhat, with a projected increase of the annual production from the current 6–8 thousand bottles to 15 thousand by 2025, but the production will remain well below mass-market levels.[6]
Popularity among Bourbon enthusiasts[edit]
The product has a cult-like following.[14][15] Famous chefs such as Anthony Bourdain and David Chang have favored the product.[2] Food Republic reported that Chef John Currence said: "There's Pappy Van Winkle, then there's everything else."[15] Bourbon aficionados have shown up in droves to get a small chance in a lottery to purchase some.[16][17] It has been called "the bourbon everyone wants but no one can get".[2] A writer for The Wall Street Journal said "You could call it bourbon, or you could call it a $5,000 bottle of liquified, barrel-aged unobtanium."[5][13] Jen Doll wrote in The Wire, "It's an age-old dilemma (supply and demand) leading to an age-old marketing dream (a product that can't be kept on the shelves ... money in the pockets ... bourbon in the bourbon snifters)."[2][4][13]
According to Fox News and Maxim, PVW-23 is said to be one of the most expensive bourbons.[18]
Style[edit]
Like all modern bourbons, Van Winkle bourbons are made primarily from corn and aged in charred new oak barrels. A distinguishing feature of Van Winkle bourbons is their use of wheat as the secondary ingredient instead of the usual rye, and their additional inclusion of barley malt.
Pappy Van Winkle is aged for 15, 20 or 23 years, which is considerably longer than the aging period for most bourbons. The 20 year is bottled at 90.4 U.S. proof (45.2% alcohol by volume)[9] and has been described as "intensely fruity".[3] The 15 year is bottled at 107 proof.[19] The 23 year is bottled at 95.6 proof.[3]
Awards[edit]
Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve has won various awards.[1][20]

Pappy Van Winkle 20 Year Old Family Reserve won a Double Gold Medal at the 2014 San Francisco World Spirits Competition.[1][20]
Pappy Van Winkle's Family Reserve 23 Year Old Bourbon was named "Spirit of the Year" for 2010 by Wine & Spirits magazine in its annual buying guide issue.[21]
The 20 Year Old Special Reserve was recognized with the "Trophy for Worldwide Whisky" and a Best-In-Class Gold Medallion in the 2008 International Wine and Spirit Competition.[22] It received a score of 99 ("superlative") from the Beverage Testing Institute in the same year.[22]
"A rating from the Beverage Testing Institute created the Pappy frenzy." The 99 rating for the 20-year Pappy Van Winkle was the highest rating ever. Thus, Pappy "was rescued from schmaltzy marketing hell and exploded into the cult it is today."[6]

Limited edition decanter[edit]
The Van Winkles released a special limited edition decanter set of specially selected Old Rip Van Winkle 23 year old, 114 proof Van Winkle bourbon barreled in the spring of 1986.[23]
2013 theft[edit]
In mid-October 2013 the company reported the theft of 65 three-bottle cases of Pappy Van Winkle 20 Year and nine three-bottle cases of 13-year-old Van Winkle Family Reserve rye.[3][8][24] Police theorized that it took the thief about two months to complete the heist, and noted that whoever did it avoided being recorded by security cameras.[14]
On Monday December 2, Sheriff Melton announced a $10,000 reward to anyone who could give information that leads to a conviction in the case. $1,000 of this reward money was offered by Bluegrass Crimestoppers and the other $9,000 by an anonymous donor.[25]
A break in the case came in March 2014 when a Buffalo Trace employee was arrested by Franklin County authorities when five barrels of stolen Wild Turkey bourbon were found on his property. On April 21, 2015 nine Kentucky residents, three of whom were employees at both Wild Turkey and Buffalo Trace, were indicted for thefts at the Buffalo Trace and Wild Turkey distilleries dating back to 2008. Over $100,000 worth of the stolen whiskey was recovered, including more than two dozen bottles of Pappy Van Winkle and 15 barrels of Wild Turkey.[26] The Van Winkle family has stated that the stolen whiskey should be destroyed as a precaution against tampering or contamination, pending the approval of the judge.[27][28][29]
The heists included Pappy Van Winkle (more than 20 cases), 50 to 70 cases of Eagle Rare bourbon, and stolen barrels of other whiskey that are still missing. The warrants recovered one barrel of 17-year-old Eagle Rare worth more than $11,000.[30][31] All nine defendants are charged with being members of a criminal syndicate, engaging in organized crime.[32]
Forgeries and counterfeit bourbon[edit]
Empty bottles have turned up on eBay at extravagant prices. It turns out that the bottles are being recycled, refilled with counterfeit bourbon and sold as true Pappy.[33]

Said Jack Rose’s Katie Williams: “We know the right people.” (Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post)   By Karen Heller  By Karen Heller   October 12, 2014  Follow @kheller     Hunting season nears, not only for wild game but the rarer prey of domestic small-batch whiskey. In a matter of weeks, the frenzied search for that most American of spirits and elusive of brands will begin anew.  Only 7,500 cases of aged Van Winkle bourbon will ship from a warehouse in Frankfort, Ky., to distributors, before arriving at select liquor stores and watering holes fortunate to score a few bottles, with a pronounced emphasis on a few.  The search for Van Winkle has inspired a song, a blog, an app and a delirious secondary market where a bottle has fetched as much as $2,600. Also, theft. From now until the bourbon arrives at Schneider’s of Capitol Hill, most likely in November, “we’ll get 15 to 20 calls a day asking for Pappy,” said general manager Joseph Prebble, referring to the most coveted older (15, 20 and 23 year) expressions of the wheated whiskey.  The calls are useless. Pappy, which ships just once a year, will never grace the shelves there or at many other stores, as supply is limited and top customers get priority. Many enthusiasts, who would gladly pay the $80 that the 15-year-old should sell for, will never get their hands on a bottle. The drought is all the more confounding because only six years ago it was possible for anyone to score a couple of bottles, even at a charmless Pennsylvania state store. Now the whiskey has vanished — poof! — like a bourbon Brigadoon.  President Julian Van Winkle III spent much of his 65 years trying to get the world to notice the whiskey that bears his grandfather’s name and cigar-puffing likeness. “Bourbon was really nothing back then when I started. It was perceived as something just the good old boys were drinking down South,” he said.  “It’s basically been the same recipe for 120 years, more or less, with a few tweaks.” said Preston Van Winkle, Julian’s son. The bourbon didn’t change; it was consumers’ tastes, driving an international market mad for American whiskey and Pappy in particular. Preston has less than half a bottle in his Louisville home.  The reason for Pappy hysteria is older than the bourbon: Extraordinary demand and limited supply that could not have been predicted when the whiskey was first barreled during the final gasps of the 20th century. The bourbon revival is part of a craving for luxury goods, all things American, especially from the South, along with a DIY appreciation for craft businesses, and a desire for richer-tasting liquor — small-batch gin, rye and bourbon. (Contrary to myth, bourbon can be distilled anywhere in the nation, not just Kentucky.) “Bourbon is the hottest spirit in the world, the top category in spirits from London to Japan for the past five years,” said Tom Fischer, who runs BourbonBlog.com.  Unlike many elusive objects of desire, there is little dispute about the bourbon’s quality. Even critics confounded by the chase concede that Van Winkle makes very, very good whiskey.  In 1996, the 20-year-old Pappy received an unprecedented 99 whiskey rating from the venerable Beverage Tasting Institute, but all six expressions — the three Pappy productions, Old Rip Van Winkle (10 year), Van Winkle Special Reserve (12 year) and Family Reserve Rye (13 year) — have collected superb ratings and multiple awards. Today, there are other bourbons as highly ranked (Four Roses Limited Edition, Buffalo Trace Antique Collection), but Pappy continues to be the most difficult to find, the Holy Grail of a luxury-mad cocktail market that has migrated to such pre-Prohibition whiskey drinks as the Old-Fashioned, the Manhattan and the Sazerac.  The unquenchable quest for Pappy, already difficult, became criminal last October, when almost 200 bottles of the 20-year-old Pappy van Winkle and 27 of the 13-year-old Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye were purloined from the warehouse. An inside job was suspected, and the bottles have not been recovered. Said Julian Van Winkle III: “We got $10 million worth of free advertising we didn’t need at the time.”  However, it is possible to purchase a $108 bottle of 23-year-old Pappy on eBay.  The bottle is empty. There’s no secret what the Van Winkles think of the secondary market. They hate it.  “It’s horrible. It infuriates me because it shows just a complete and utter disrespect for the customer and for us,” said Preston Van Winkle. “There’s plenty of money to be made off our products. Just take a fair markup. But sellers do it because they can.”  Many stores, such as the four Wine and Cheese Place locations around St. Louis, sell at the suggested price but conduct a lottery, which the Van Winkles believe is the fairest approach. Last year, 1,400 people entered the Missouri lottery for a score of bottles in the double digits.  Kyle Buza’s Pappy Tracker app posts sightings, like paparazzi stalking celebrity prey, though once a bottle has been photographed, chances are it has long been sold or drained to the last caramel-colored drops. “Every year it gets worse, because every store knows how valuable it is,” said Buza, a Menlo Park, Calif., software engineer, who recently drove to a secret location, six hours by car, to score another bottle.    There have been Van Winkles in whiskey since 1893, beginning with the original Julian Van Winkle, known as Pappy, a consummate salesman and character. The Van Winkle label was launched after the family was forced, by stockholder pressure in 1972, to sell the famed Stitzel-Weller distillery, producer of the W.L. Weller, Old Fitzgerald, Rebel Yell and Cabin Still labels. For the past dozen years, Van Winkle whiskey has been produced as a joint venture with the Sazerac Co. at the Buffalo Trace distillery.  In the 1970s and 1980s, the family was basically in the gewgaw business, pushing fancy decanters as retirement gifts and collectors items that just happened to hold the whiskey. Bourbon had lost its buzz. When Julian Van Winkle III first entered the business, his father told him: “If this doesn’t work out, you might want to talk to some bankers or insurance companies about a job.”  The son poured more than phone calls and whiskey into the business: “It took a lot of my money to keep this thing going.” He continues to adhere to his grandfather Pappy’s motto: “We make fine bourbon. At a profit if we can, at a loss if we must. But always, fine bourbon.” Today, the third-generation Van Winkle sits in the Louisville office that he shares with his son, the firm’s two sole employees, turning down ardent buyers from all over the globe.  No to Brazil. No to Korea. No to Russia. There are 10 states where you cannot score a bottle. Which gives the third Julian Van Winkle no pleasure: “It took a lot of time to get here. I’m the kind of guy who likes to please people, not make them angry.”  Among those people who dream of Van Winkle bourbon is Chris Brantley of Savannah, Ga.. Two years ago, he launched the Pursuit of Pappy blog, which has 4,000 monthly visitors. He composes paeans to Pappy. “It’s the character, the taste,” he said. “The scarcity of it that drives the interest.”  He should know. Brantley hasn’t had a sip of Pappy since February. Of last year.  “Possibly that is the charm in Pappy Van Winkle,” Brantley observed on his blog. In an Uber culture of instant gratification, on-demand clicks and same-day delivery, Pappy fans have to wait.  The rise of Pappy occurred when that scarcity mashed up against increased demand in a global quest for specialty goods: With a multiyear, even multidecade production, the Van Winkles can anticipate market demand only so far in advance. Said Preston Van Winkle: “We could double production, and still sell out.” As a reflection of evolving taste, Schneider’s last year transferred its selection of American whiskey to the front of the store, a fifth of the spirits inventory, and pushed to the back the vodka, its moment so over.  Chefs have certainly played a part in driving the Pappy mystique: David Chang, Anthony Bourdain and Sean Brock of Charleston, S.C., the South’s most celebrated cook and arguably Pappy’s greatest crusader, who begged Julian to adopt him and dubbed the bourbon “America’s finest product.” Professional hunters like the Pappy Tracker’s Buza have amassed large stashes. Buza has 15 bottles. Jack Rose Dining Saloon in Adams Morgan, with 450 types of bourbon and 2,000 different whiskeys, still has plenty. The 20-year Pappy goes for $45 an ounce. How does the place have so much so close to the next release season? Said Jack Rose’s Katie Williams: “We know the right people.” Last month, Julian Van Winkle III discovered two bottles of 20-year-old Pappy in a bar in Milan, a city known more for design than for whiskey. “I paid dearly for them, probably $200 a piece,” a steal, and plans to auction them for charity. His three 35-year-old daughters — yes, there are Van Winkle triplets — decided that there was more money to be distilled from the family elixir. Last year, the sisters launched Pappy & Company (pappyco.com) promoting the whiskey lifestyle: belt buckles, needlepoint coasters, shirts, ties, bourbon balls as well as a limited edition Van Winkle signature gift set with a crystal decanter and glasses, yours for $825. The Pappy Van Winkle bourbon, it will come as little shock, is not included.          lifestyle style        true          Please provide a valid email address.

a letter from the van winkle family

We are frequently asked why our whiskey is so hard to find. It’s difficult to put a finger on just one or two particular reasons, but here are a few things that have led to the popularity and scarcity of our whiskey.
First, the whiskey is very good. When something is good, you naturally tell others about it. Word of mouth is priceless.
In the early nineties we received a very high rating from the Chicago Beverage Testing Institute. That led to receiving many awards from tasting competitions by beverage magazines both here and abroad. Even celebrity chefs have touted our whiskey as being their favorite. That type of advertising is something we could never afford, but it has certainly contributed to our brand becoming a cult phenomenon. For that we are grateful.
Another contributing factor was joining the Sazerac/Buffalo Trace family. This merger spread knowledge of our brand way beyond Kentucky and into other major markets.
One last thing to know is that, unfortunately, some retailers choose to use this demand as a reason to increase their pricing. We know it’s often sold for far beyond our suggested retail prices, which you can find on the product pages of this site.
We greatly appreciate all of our fans and your support. We hope that you have the chance to try some of our fine whiskey for yourself.

            Best of luck to you,
            The Van Winkles

Julian P. Van Winkle III: The Arbiter of Taste

Go into the tasting room with a third-generation whiskey man

August/September 2012

Lots of people are mad at Julian P. Van Winkle III. Van Winkle is the president of the Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery, whose aged bourbons a growing body of aficionados believe to be the finest whiskeys on Earth. The trouble is that demand for his Pappy Van Winkle’s Family Reserve bourbons has lately swollen in exasperating proportion to supply. He releases between 6,000 and 7,000 cases per year, “about what Jim Beam puts out in ten minutes,” Van Winkle says. “We’re the opposite of the Walmart business model: high profit and almost no volume at all.”
The scarcity is making bourbon lovers desperate, cranky, and poor. On eBay, Van Winkle bourbons routinely command upwards of $500 a bottle. Pappy turns up on bar menus in Van Winkle’s hometown of Louisville, Kentucky, for as much as $60, usually alongside the caveat “WHEN AVAILABLE.” The bourbons are distributed to liquor stores only twice a year—in spring and fall—and a half dozen, give or take (bottles, not cases), is the average allocation. The bottles rarely touch the shelves, instead going straight to customers whose names have been on waiting lists for months or years.

So much bother for a sip of whiskey does not endear Van Winkle to the drinking public, or to shopkeepers, one of whom not long ago bodily attacked Van Winkle’s sales agent for showing up with too meager a delivery. “It can get dangerous,” says Van Winkle. “In Michigan, a guy physically ran our sales rep out of a store because he didn’t get but two or three bottles. He was so damn angry about it. Threatened him with a shoe or a gun or something. I’ve never had to deal with that kind of thing face to face, but I’m sure it’s coming someday.”
One does not want to imagine what rashnesses Pappy fans might be moved to if they could see what Julian Van Winkle is doing with his bourbon this morning: He is spitting it out. Pints upon pints, pinging into the spittoon in a practiced, laminar stream.


A visiting journalist is frankly appalled to see greatness treated so brusquely. It’s like watching someone ride a moped through the Louvre. “Hard work, but someone’s gotta do it,” says Van Winkle, sixty-three, whose clear blue eyes and relatively uncreased complexion do not betray a lifelong career of concerted bourbon use.
The desecration is taking place in the tasting room at the Buffalo Trace Distillery in Frankfort, Kentucky. A decade ago, Buffalo Trace (which also makes such venerable labels as Blanton’s and W. L. Weller) began distilling the Pappy Van Winkle recipe, in partnership with Van Winkle. Today, the first batches of Buffalo Trace Pappy are reaching bottling maturity, and Van Winkle has made the forty-five-minute drive from Louisville to undertake what is in fact momentous spittoon duty: to assay whether Buffalo Trace’s handiwork deserves the family name.

Aging Gracefully
Barrels at Buffalo Trace.


A flotilla of forty-seven partially filled graduated goblets and half-pint bottles—each drawn from a separate barrel—are arrayed before Van Winkle on a lazy Susan. Each barrel requires individual sampling because barrel aging is not an exact science, but an ineluctable, chaotic passage through which the whiskey grows a soul. Seasoned in a charred oak barrel, bourbon acquires its dark complexion and, as it picks up oak sugars in the caramelized wood, much of its sweetness, too. The ratio of barrel staves made from sapwood to those made from heartwood affects the bourbon’s flavor, as do seemingly trifling considerations such as proximity to a window and altitude. “Whiskey on the top floors ages faster,” Van Winkle explains. “We don’t keep our barrels any higher than the middle floors because it’s going to be there so long. It would pick up too much oak.”
As the whiskey ages, it evaporates volume through the wood—10 percent the first year and 4 to 5 percent each subsequent year, an attrition known as the angels’ share. On a twenty-three-year-old barrel, the angels’ share is about fifty gallons out of the original fifty-three, which partly explains Van Winkle 23’s heart-stopping expense. “When it comes to our bourbon, the angels are very greedy,” Van Winkle observes.
Julian Van Winkle’s palate is the ultimate arbiter as to whether a barrel ends up in a Van Winkle bottle. But he is decidedly not a notes-of-pencil-shavings-and-asphalt sort of taster. “Mm, nice and mild,” “Man, that’s so sweet,” “A little bite to this one, a little rough,” are the comments he makes as the table revolves. “I don’t have a schooled palate,” he says. “For me, it’s: ‘This is what I like, and if it tastes like this, it’s all right with me.’”
Van Winkle’s humble manner with a whiskey that critics herniate themselves describing is rooted in an abiding family aversion to high science and cold connoisseurship. His grandfather Julian P. “Pappy” Van Winkle (he appears lipping a stogie on the labels that bear his name) “had a sign at the old distillery that said, ‘No Chemists Allowed,’” Julian says. “He didn’t have a lab, just some litmus paper and a hydrometer to get the proof right. He believed all you need to make fine bourbon are Mother Nature and Father Time.”
In 1893, at the age of eighteen, Pappy Van Winkle entered the whiskey business as a traveling salesman for W. L. Weller. The product he sold in those days was not, strictly speaking, bourbon. According to federal law, straight bourbon whiskey must be distilled in the United States (but not necessarily Kentucky) from a mash of at least 51 percent corn. It must be aged in new charred oak barrels, and it may not be adulterated with any additives other than water. The early Weller whiskeys were “rectified” with flavoring and coloring agents, and proof was often corrected with grain alcohol. Years later, as president of the Stitzel-Weller Distillery, after Pappy had become a vehement, exacting crusader for traditionally manufactured bourbon, he was asked about his early perfidies in the rectifying trade. “There’s no one purer than a reformed prostitute” was his reply.

Through the sixties, Stitzel-Weller bottled respected bourbons under such labels as Old Fitzgerald, W. L. Weller, and Rebel Yell (a different product from the down-market, frat house libation it is today). Van Winkle’s bourbons owed their excellence, in part, to the vast substrate of limestone that filters the local groundwater to uncommon purity, and to Pappy’s recipe. In addition to corn, bourbon generally uses rye as a secondary grain. Pappy’s mash bill called for wheat, a milder, sweeter grain that picks up less barrel char and is gentler to the tongue.
In 1972, seven years after Pappy’s death, stockholders forced the distillery’s sale. Julian had recently returned to Louisville after attending Virginia’s Randolph-Macon College, where he studied economics and psychology. After a stint as a clothing salesman, he joined his father, Julian, Jr., salvaging what could be salvaged of the family whiskey business. Barrels of Pappy’s recipe were quiescently marking time in Stitzel-Weller’s warehouses. Father and son kept the company alive, buying back their own bourbon and bottling it independently under the Old Rip Van Winkle label.


When cancer took Julian’s father in 1981, Julian, at the age of thirty-two with four children to support, made the not-ostensibly-wise decision to continue in the whiskey business, bottling Van Winkle bourbons with his own hands in a flood-prone ruin of a facility he purchased south of Louisville. The 1980s were dark years for bourbon and largely profitless years for Julian. The spirits market had so bafflingly and resolutely forsaken bourbon for scotch, vodka, and gin that the drinking public could be induced to pay good money for bourbon only if it was bottled in a novelty crock resembling a coal miner or a football or a dog. Julian was reduced to trafficking in these gimcracks for about a decade and a half. Then, in 1996, a Van Winkle sales rep submitted bottles of Van Winkle 20-year to the Beverage Testing Institute, a prestigious Chicago-based wine authority. The Pappy Van Winkle 20-year-old got a rating of 99, an unprecedented number for any whiskey, scotch, or bourbon. An avalanche of demand and acclaim followed, concluding most recently with a James Beard Foundation award in 2011.

Do the Pappy whiskeys deserve the fervent hype and covetousness? I put the question to bourbon enthusiast and fellow James Beard winner Sean Brock, chef at the celebrated Charleston, South Carolina, restaurants McCrady’s and Husk. “What I should say is, it’s the worst bourbon in the entire world. It’s a rip-off; don’t buy it. But, no, for me, it’s an obsession. You can taste the patience, the care, the craft. You know you’re tasting something that’s been aged properly without cutting corners. Their [motto] says it all,” adds Brock, citing a creed stamped on a plaque that Pappy hung at the entrance of the Stitzel-Weller distillery: “‘At a profit if we can, at a loss if we must, but always fine bourbon.’ If more people looked at their business models that way, America would be a much cooler place to hang out.”
When Julian Van Winkle has sipped his way through the morning’s forty-seven barrels, I prevail on him to share a splash or two from some bottled vintages, a tempting selection of which—a 15-year, a 20-, and a 23-—stand on a nearby shelf in the tasting room. He passes me a glass with a modest amber dose of the 23. “It’s too oaky for some, but I like it,” he says. I put my snoot into the glass. It is not too oaky. It is supple, warm, and suffused with an intelligent sweetness. It tastes like the realization of an ideal all other bourbons I’ve had aspire to with incomplete success. I can say that I pick up notes of vanilla, butterscotch, and assorted citrus fruit, but I don’t write about citrus notes in my little notebook. What I jot are some raptures too fatuously sentimental and foolish to reprint and which are anyway irrelevant to the matter at hand. I mention the goofy mawkishness good bourbon inspires only to note that good bourbon is a weird thing—a fluid that thrills us and rouses the soul by means defiant of connoisseurship and not wholly related to alcoholic intoxication. The late Louisiana novelist Walker Percy made a brilliant study of this phenomenon in a short essay, a copy of which I’ve brought along in my pocket. There in the tasting room, I read a few lines aloud to Mr. Van Winkle.
“The joy of bourbon drinking is not the pharmacological effect of the C2H5OH on the cortex but rather the instant of the whiskey being knocked back and the little explosion of Kentucky U.S.A. sunshine in the cavity of the nasopharynx and the hot bosky bite of Tennessee summertime—aesthetic considerations to which the effect of the alcohol is, if not dispensable, at least secondary.… Bourbon does for me what the piece of cake did for Proust.”
“A bourbon and what?”
The passage carries Van Winkle into memories of his childhood sickbed when his parents plied him with honeyed bourbon (“good frickin’ bourbon, old Stitzel-Weller, probably made in the forties”), and of young parenthood, when he would serve straight 107 proof to his sick children—a son and a triplet litter of daughters. “We had to knock those kids out, or nobody got any sleep.” We drink the 20-year, the 15-, leaving the spittoon be. A long unremembered moment returns to me: my first drink with my late grandfather. I ordered a bourbon and Coke. He made a face like I’d called him a name. “A bourbon and what?” he said. I have not revisited the barbarism since.
By the end of the day, Van Winkle has made his way through another full program of samples, with better results than he’d expected.  Pappy’s future looks sound: out of ninety-four barrels, “only one dog in the bunch.”
On the road back to Louisville, I ask Van Winkle why, with a high-volume distillery in his corner and the public in full ferment for his product, doesn’t he seize this moment to crank the stills to capacity and cash in? “Well, the quality would go down,” he says, as though this is explanation enough. “I don’t need a ton of money. I’m comfortable. Why get bigger? I mean, yeah, I guess I’d like to have a jet to fly around in, but things like that just complicate your life.” He does, however, have some happy news for anyone who has yet to lay hands on a bottle of Pappy: Production is expanding. Not by much, just 2 to 3 percent a year. Not to try to make a killing, Van Winkle says, “just to try not to have quite so many people mad at me.”

How to Find Our Whiskeys
We only release stock once per year, because we’re a small company. On October 1, we tell our wholesalers how many bottles they’ll receive. From there, they determine which retailers get that inventory, and distribute accordingly. So it often hits shelves anywhere from mid-October to early December. US Federal law prohibits direct sale of distilled spirits, so we can’t sell it ourselves. Because we don’t control which retailers receive our stock, we can’t track inventory at a retailer level. The list below will help you find retailers that are likely to receive stock, but we can’t know for certain.
We know our whiskey can be difficult to find, so our advice is to ask retailers in your area if they expect to receive stock, and if so, how they plan to sell it. Many retailers use a lottery or a waiting list to sell our stock. We recommend you get on as many waiting lists and enter as many lotteries as you can.
Best of luck!

                Virginia ABC to Offer Rare Old Rip Van Winkle 25 Year Old Bourbon Through Lottery Program
Bourbon lovers will get the chance to score a once-in-a-lifetime product from one of the nation’s most famous distilleries next week on Virginia ABC’s website.
From 9 a.m. on May 10 to 9 a.m. on May 12, customers will be able to enter a lottery for the chance to purchase one of ten bottles of the extremely rare Old Rip Van Winkle 25 year old bourbon. The entry form can be accessed on the Virginia ABC website at https://www.abc.virginia.gov/products/limited-availability.
Old Rip Van Winkle is the result of a special, one-time bottling from 11 barrels distilled in 1989. Retailing for $1,799.99, each bottle comes in a handmade glass decanter from Glencairn Crystal Studio and is packaged in a handmade wooden box crafted from the barrels that held the bourbon. Inside is a bourbon certificate of authenticity signed by Julian P. Van Winkle, III, grandson of founder Julian P. “Pappy” Van Winkle.
“Virginia ABC is very excited to be able to offer Old Rip Van Winkle through our lottery system,” said Virginia ABC Chief Operating Officer Travis Hill. “The ability to offer limited release, high-end products is one of the many benefits of our growing online commerce capabilities.”
Customers with winning lottery entries must take their confirmation email and ID to their local ABC store and pre-pay for the bottle. 
“ABC’s online lotteries give all customers equal opportunity to purchase products we receive in small quantities,” said Virginia ABC Director of Marketing John Shiffer. “It means that residents in rural areas have just as much opportunity to enjoy our high-end products as residents in more urban parts of Virginia.”
Virginia ABC has held 27 lotteries for exclusive products since the online program’s launch in 2016 including lotteries for three high-demand Van Winkle products in December.

Stop The Panic! Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery Is Shipping More Product Next Week



If your local bartender is a bit short on Van Winkle whiskies, don’t worry any more. The Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery  promises more will be on the way to “select stores”  as mentioned on their facebook page. If you don’t believe them go and take a peak on their distillery web cams.

The Old Rip Van Winkle Distillery has a four generation history. The Van Winkle family’s involvement in the bourbon industry began in the late 1800s with Julian P. “Pappy” Van Winkle, Sr. Recently, the Van Winkles entered into a joint venture with the Buffalo Trace Distillery in Frankfort, KY. All of the Van Winkle’s whiskey production now takes place at Buffalo Trace under the same strict guidelines the family has always followed in order to produce a superior quality product.
Aside from the rich family history, Van Winkle bourbons are special for another important reason, their recipe. All of the Van Winkle bourbons are made with corn, wheat, and, barley instead of corn, rye and, barley. This “wheated” recipe gives the bourbon a much softer, smoother taste and it also allows the whiskey to age more gracefully.

About Online Ordering






This extra special, one-time bottling of Van Winkle bourbon is bottled at 100 proof and comes in a handmade glass decanter from Glencairn Crystal Studio. Each bottle is individually numbered and labeled and includes a silver stopper and certificate of authenticity, all tucked inside a wooden box made from the oak staves of the barrels that aged this unique bourbon. The barrels were distilled in the spring and fall of 1989 and stored on the lower levels of a metal-clad warehouse built in 1935 at the Van Winkle family distillery in Shively, KY.
