  ABOUT NORTHSTAR    
                      

  Northstar
      Electronics, Inc. is a Delaware incorporated company, working in
      the
      aviation, defense, and marine industries.  

  The Company listed
      on the OTCBB
      under the symbol NEIK in 2000 and is currently trading on OTC
      Markets.

 Northstar
        has a long history of developing and manufacturing defense
        and commercial electronic and mechanical systems. 

 The company is
        now
        being restructured to go forward with a renewed focus on the
        development of a new aviation business 

 and carry out work to
        develop
        innovative sonar systems. In addition to a small number of
        internal
        personnel, Northstar's 

 new business model utilizes outside
        expert
        associates to ensure that we have world class talent working on
        our
        projects.  



  Northstar
      began
      operations in the late 1990’s by developing an innovative
      underwater sonar system for the international commercial 

  fishing
      industry.  Shortly after, in 2000, the Company was awarded a
      contract from Lockheed Martin MS2 for the assembly of Command

  and
      Control consoles for the Canadian Navy’s submarines.  This
      was
      followed by Northstar being invited to be a junior partner on
      

  Lockheed
      Martin’s team for the pursuit of a $3.2B military helicopter
      contract. This venture opened new relationships for Northstar
      

  within
      their company.



  Lockheed
      Martin then contracted Northstar to develop and build the
      underwater
      portion of an anti-terrorism sonar system, 

  designed to protect
      aircraft
      carriers and other ships of the US Navy from terrorist diver
      attacks.
       This was a major effort 

  and Northstar successfully
      accomplished
      the work in the required short timeframe.  




  Lockheed
      Martin subsequently awarded Northstar the first of two contracts,
      together worth approximately $16M, 

  to manufacture a number of
      small
      mechanical parts for C130 (Hercules) aircraft that were being
      refurbished. 

  Also, a subsidiary of L3 Communications awarded
      Northstar a contract, which grew to about $4M, to manufacture
      

  Command
      and Control consoles for navy frigates.  Northstar’s revenues
      reached over $4M in 2009.   


  ------

  Our
      efforts
      over the past year have been aimed at turning Northstar
      around and injecting new energy into it. 

  We are now working to
      expand
      into aviation manufacturing and distribution.
 
  Northstar Electronics’ subsidiary, Northstar Sealand Enterprises Ltd. (NSEL) ,  has been working towards 
  an agreement with an aerospace company to authorize Northstar Sealand Enterprises Ltd. to start to assemble, 
  certify, manufacture, service, repair, and market a new version of a turboprop single engine airplane for 
  the World marketplace. (The market area has been expanded to global scale, which should add considerably 
  to NSEL's sales potential.) 
  The airplane is used in multi-purpose commercial applications in a growing market.  
     
  We are continuing our market research and planning new sales strategies to generate orders from 
  the larger new markets. Letters of expression of interest in the new aircraft have been received from 
  prospective customers. 
  We are planning flight demonstrations for next year,  with first deliveries expected in late fall.
 
  Once we achieve our objectives, we believe that 
our share price will respond favorably and that it could reach 
   a 
reasonable and stable price range.

(OTC Pink: NEIK), a product development corporation, working in the aviation, defense, and marine industries, announces a shareholder letter regarding NEIK's on-going operations.The shareholders letter is attached below:Dear Shareholders,As you are aware, we are taking Northstar in a new direction, one in which the Company is making and selling its own systems rather than being a contract manufacturer. We are now expanding into the growing aviation manufacturing and distribution industry, which is an excellent fit for the talent pool in and around the company.The Company became the majority owner of a newly formed company, Northstar Sealand Enterprises Ltd. (NSEL), in early 2015 and, since then, NSEL has constituted the operational side of Northstar.We at Northstar and NSEL have set corporate goals for 2016 which we believe are realistic and accretive in revenue creation.A high priority for Northstar is to become current with its 1933 Act reporting requirements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Our goal for 2016 Q1 is to complete the financial statements in arrears, file with the US SEC EDGAR Filing Division and return to the OTCQB trading platform.We believe that in 2016 Q1/Q2, NSEL should complete negotiations with an international aerospace company and sign an agreement for the rights to a single engine turboprop commercial aircraft. This plane has an excellent performance history and new enhancements are now being implemented. With the agreement signed, NSEL plans to initiate production and roll out a marketing program aimed at introducing the new version of the plane in the world marketplace.Northstar has been actively pursuing a capital raise to be utilized for its own public company activities and for NSEL's operational needs. Our goal for 2016 Q1/Q2 is to use these funds to support, amongst other activities, the development of NSEL's corporate Quality Infrastructure.In 2016 Q2, NSEL goals are to sign joint marketing agreements and appoint domestic and international sales representatives. The sales representatives and the NSEL executive team will work aggressively to make sales presentations to qualified end-user prospects with the goal of closing our first order.In 2016 Q3/Q4, NSEL expects the international aerospace company to complete the enhancements of the prototype aircraft and to complete the overseas certification & test fly a prototype of the aircraft. Concurrently, NSEL plans to make significant progress toward North American certification. Our goal, in this period, is to ship the first aircraft to the end-user. Another goal of the NSEL sales team is to close an order for a second aircraft to be delivered in 2016 Q3/Q4.In 2016 Q4, Northstar has the goal to raise additional working capital for investment in infrastructure and production transition to North America from overseas.2016 looks to be a year when Northstar Electronics, Inc. establishes itself as a solid, progressive company. In 2017, we expect to build on our 2016 efforts and achieve significant sales growth. In the longer term, Northstar, through NSEL, aims to become an international leader in the turboprop single engine manufacturing, marketing, sales, and MRO (Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul) business.Your continued shareholder support is greatly appreciated as we move towards the production of new advanced aircraft which will have the capabilities to make it a success in the world of fire-fighting and agriculture.Best Regards,Wilson Russell, Ph.D.Chairman/CEO/PresidentFor further information about this release, contact Rich Kaiser, Investor Relations, YES INTERNATIONAL, 757-306-6090, yes@yesinternational.com, and Eddie Cruz.

Northstar Electronics, Inc. (NEIK) Begins Filing Reports to Become Current with U.S. SEC, Provides Business Update


VIRGINIA BEACH, VA / ACCESSWIRE / March 10, 2016 / Northstar Electronics, Inc. (OTC: NEIK), a product development company, working in the aviation, defense, and marine industries, provides an update on its current activities.
The Company filed an amended 10K for the year 2011 on March 8, 2016 and management is now working to file the 2012, 2013 and 2014 year ends as one filing. This filing, as well as, the 2015 10K for the period ending December 31, 2015, should bring the Company current on its filings under the 1933 Act. Once current, the Company intends to apply for its stock to up-list to the OTCQB trading platform. Once there, management believes the credibility of the OTCQB listing will be an advantage for the Company when dealing with institutional investors.
NEIK continues to work towards an agreement with an international aerospace company for the rights to a turbo prop single engine commercial airplane. With an agreement in place, Northstar's subsidiary, Northstar Sealand Enterprises Ltd. (NSEL), plans to initiate its primary activities including a strong marketing campaign to introduce the new version of the airplane to high prospect areas internationally.
Northstar will shortly be actively pursuing a capital raise to be utilized mainly for NSEL's operational needs and enhancements to present production capabilities, and for Northstar's public company obligations in addition to assisting NSEL in new business developments. Management is focused on raising working capital through non-dilutive methods.
