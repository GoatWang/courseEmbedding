The Fund seeks capital appreciation and current income by investing in a diversified portfolio of common stocks, debt securities and money market instruments.
Fund Information for Mutual of America's Group Products (Except Defined Benefit and Pension Investment Contract), SEP and SIMPLE Contracts Separate Account No. 2 - Standard Pricing Composite FundPrincipal Investment StrategiesReturn to TopThe Fund invests a portion of its assets in equity and in fixed income (including money market) securities, where the portion in each category of securities will vary based on Mutual of America Capital Management LLC's (the "Adviser") view of current economic and market conditions.

The equity portion of the Fund is invested in stocks in the S&P 500® Index, as selected by the large cap equity manager of the Adviser. The Adviser generally invests in stocks that it considers undervalued, or to have attractive growth potential, and with the potential for investment returns that outperform their peer companies.
The fixed income portion of the Fund is invested primarily in investment-grade debt securities issued by U.S. corporations or by the U.S. Government or its agencies, including mortgage-backed securities, as managed by the fixed income and mortgage-backed securities managers of the Adviser. The Adviser evaluates each security to be purchased and selects securities based on maturity, credit quality as determined by fundamental analysis and interest income anticipated to be generated.
The money market portion of the Fund invests in debt securities with a remaining maturity of 397 calendar days or less that present minimal credit risks.Fund Information for Mutual of America's Group Products (Except Defined Benefit and Pension Investment Contract), SEP and SIMPLE Contracts Separate Account No. 2 - Standard Pricing Composite FundPrincipal Investment RisksReturn to TopAn investment in the Fund is subject to the following risks which are described in more detail in the Statutory Prospectus.

General risk: The Fund may not achieve its investment objective. An investment in the Fund could decline in value, and you could lose money by investing in the Fund.
Company risk: The price of the stock of a particular company can vary based on a variety of factors, such as the company's financial performance, changes in management and product trends, and the potential for takeover and acquisition. The prices of equity securities of smaller companies may fluctuate more than for more established companies. The equity securities of smaller companies may not be traded as often as for larger companies, therefore it may be difficult to trade securities at a desirable price. Investments in companies with small market capitalizations generally offer greater opportunities for appreciation, but are associated with more risks than for established companies.
Market risk: The risk that prices of securities will go down because of the interplay of market forces may affect a single issuer, industry or sector of the economy or may affect the market as a whole.
Large Cap risk: Larger, more established companies may be unable to respond quickly to new competitive challenges and also may not be able to attain the high growth rate of successful smaller companies.
Mortgage risk: The duration of mortgage-related securities and interest rates tend to move together. As interest rates rise, the duration of mortgage-related securities extends (referred to as "extension risk") and as interest rates fall, mortgage-related securities are often prepaid at a faster rate (referred to as "pre-payment risk"). Because of interest rate changes, it is not possible to predict the realized yield or average life of a mortgage-backed security. Mortgage-backed securities issued by private corporations generally have more credit risk than securities issued by U.S. Government agencies.
Stock risk: The value of your investment will go up or down, depending on movements in the stock markets. The investment results may be better or worse than the results for the stock markets taken as a whole, or than the results of other funds that invest in the same types of securities. It may be more difficult for the Fund to sell a small capitalization stock or any stock that trades "over-the-counter," than a larger capitalization stock or stocks that trade on a national or regional stock exchange. 
Fixed Income risk: The value of your investment will go up or down depending on movements in the bond markets.

Investment management risk: The Fund's investment results may differ from the results of a comparable bond market and from the results of other funds that invest in the same types of securities or particular debt securities.
Interest rate risk: Fixed income securities have an inverse relationship to interest rates, such that as interest rates rise, bond values decrease, and the Fund faces a heightened level of interest rate risk under current conditions because interest rates are at historically low levels.
Corporate Debt risk: During periods of economic uncertainty, the value of corporate debt securities may decline relative to the value of U.S. government debt securities. Debt obligations are subject to the risk that issuers may not be able to pay off the principal and interest when due.
Credit risk: Debt obligations are generally subject to the risk that the issuer may be unable to make principal and interest payments when they are due.
Call risk: When interest rates decline, an issuer may have an option to call the securities before maturity, resulting in reduced income.
Non-investment grade debt risk: Non-investment grade debt obligations, known as "junk bonds," have a higher risk of default and tend to be less liquid than higher-rated securities.
Liquidity risk: The prices of debt securities may be subject to significant volatility, particularly as markets become less liquid due to limited dealer inventory of corporate bonds.Money Market instrument risk: Money Market instruments may decline in value, based on the performance of the issuer or changes in prevailing interest rates. The returns on money market instruments can be adversely affected when yields on eligible investments are low.

What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CA (NASDAQ:CA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.13)Consensus Price Target: $34.85 (0.50% downside)

What are analysts saying about CA stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about CA stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "CA is a leading information technology (IT) management software company. We are optimistic about CA’s acquisition strategy, which has enhanced its IT management, software and services portfolio. Moreover, we believe that the diversity of its products and the increased efficiency offered by them will attract customers across sectors, lending stability to its business model. Additionally, CA’s “go to market” sales strategy integrates the commercial functions of sales, marketing, brand management, pricing and consumer insight, which helps it in lowering costs, thereby improving the bottom line. Nonetheless, intensifying competition from peers, an uncertain economic environment, currency headwinds and the weak IT spending forecast by Gartner are other concerns. Notably, shares of the company has underperformed the broader market over the last one year period." (7/17/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "CA announced the acquisition of privately held Veracode for $614M in cash. Veracode provides SaaS-based application security for integration across the software development lifecycle. The deal value represents about 6.0-8.0x NTM revenue, which we view as reasonable, and discuss in more detail below. We believe providing security at the application level will become even more important over time given the ever increasing distributed nature of IT infrastructures." (3/7/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for CA (NASDAQ:CA) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Sell Ratings, 7 Hold Ratings, 5 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.13)Consensus Price Target: $34.85 (0.50% downside)

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
