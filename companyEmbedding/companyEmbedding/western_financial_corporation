Financial Institution Clients

WFC has been working closely with, and has provided various services to, community-based financial institutions since our beginning. We are proud to be one of the first broker/dealers to actively trade in those securities. 

          Today we specialize in trading, research, capital raising and mergers and acquisitions primarily for community banks with up to $1.0 billion in assets. WFC’s focus includes assisting “de novo” institutions with initial capital and our strong retail and institutional client base enables secondary offerings of common and preferred stock and the trading of those securities in the aftermarket. Our experience and knowledge of the banking industry is extensive and we are often called upon to comment in the press as well as speak at various conferences, board meetings and director retreats. 

          Throughout the years WFC has developed numerous techniques to assist community financial institutions in building shareholder value including effective shareholder communication, shareholder awareness programs, advisement as to stock splits and payment of stock and cash dividends, as well as stock buy-back programs.

Trading

In cooperation with our clearing firm, Wedbush Securities Inc., WFC has been trading the shares of locally headquartered financial institutions for over 30 years. Significant emphasis is placed on providing liquidity in relatively inactive markets and minimizing price volatility.
Capital Raising 

WFC is truly a specialist in the area of raising capital for small community banks and has been involved in a significant number of initial and secondary transactions over the years. Offerings have included the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, convertible debt, rights offerings and warrants.
Mergers & Acquisitions 

WFC provides its expertise in identifying strategic transactions for both buyers and sellers and assisting them throughout the entire process including negotiation, evaluation of pricing, transaction financing and resolution of corporate and social issues.
Fairness Opinions 

WFC offers fairness opinions to institutions wishing to issue additional securities or for those that are involved in a merger or acquisition. Our expertise and knowledge of the industry allows us to quickly and effectively evaluate a particular transaction.
Stock Buy-Back Programs 

WFC works with companies to repurchase their shares in the open market under applicable regulatory rules often proving additional share liquidity and enhancing shareholder value.
Cashless Stock Option Exercise

WFC offers a unique program which allows the exercise of “in-the-money” stock options without the need to provide “cash” to purchase the options. An efficient and cost-effective method of option exercise is available to individuals who are ready to exercise and sell.
Dividend Reinvestment Program (DRIP) 

By depositing shares with WFC, shareholders of financial institutions are able to reinvest their cash dividends into more shares (including fractional shares) of the company.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

           Great Western Financial Corporation - 1959 Product #: newitem31866303Normal Price: $99.95Our Sales Price: $79.95 (You Save: 20%)Qty:   Tweet      PRODUCT DESCRIPTION     Beautifully engraved Specimen Certificate from  Great Western Financial Corporation dated 1959. This historic document was printed by the American Banknote Company and has an 
ornate border around it with a vignette of an eagle. This item has the printed signatures of the Company�s President ( John Maher ) and Secretary and is over 46 years old.



Certificate VignetteGreat Western Financial offered traditional thrift products -- savings accounts, CDs, and mortgage loans -- as well as checking accounts, credit cards, asset management, investment advice, mutual funds (through its Sierra Trust funds), consumer finance, and insurance sales. Washington Mutual's $6.8 billion purchase of the Chatsworth, California-based firm was completed in 1997. Great Western's last reported sales were $3.6 billion in 1996.Great Western was founded as an S&L in California in 1919. In 1955 it was merged into a holding company, Great Western Financial Corp. Within five years it acquired Santa Ana Savings (1956), West Coast Savings (Sacramento, 1957), Guaranty Savings (San Jose, 1958), Central Savings (San Luis Obispo, 1959), and First Savings (Oakland, 1959). The company later bought Santa Rosa Savings (1968) and Safety Savings (Los Angeles, 1969). After purchasing four more California S&Ls in 1970 and 1971, Great Western Financial combined them all into Great Western Savings in 1972.In 1994 operations were particularly affected by the Northridge earthquake because the company had an administration center there. That year's profits, however, quadrupled, thanks to the necessity for lower loss reserves and the gain on the sale of its 31 branches on Florida's Gulf Coast.The next year chairman Montgomery passed the office of CEO to president John Maher, who accelerated the drive toward banking services. In 1996 the company announced a $115 million restructuring program that would eliminate 800 jobs, consolidate mortgage banking branches, and install new technology. In late 1996 Great Western sold its student loan business to Crestar Bank. In early 1997 California thrift H.F. Ahmanson launched a hostile takeover bid for the company, but Washington Mutual's friendly offer won out later that year.
About Specimen CertificatesSpecimen Certificates are actual certificates that have never been issued. They were usually kept  by the printers in their permanent archives as their only example of a particular certificate.  Sometimes you will see a hand stamp on the certificate that says "Do not remove from file".Specimens were also used to show prospective clients different types of certificate designs that were available. Specimen certificates are usually much scarcer than issued certificates. In fact, many times they are the only way to get a certificate for a particular company because the issued certificates were redeemed and destroyed. In a few instances, Specimen certificates were made for a company but were never used because a different design was chosen by the company.These certificates are normally stamped "Specimen" or they have small holes spelling the word specimen. Most of the time they don't have a serial number, or they have a serial number of 00000. This is an exciting sector of the hobby that has grown in popularity over the past several years.

Did you know?

Some companies sell their services as a package and offer what seems to be an irresistible price, but later they attach fees they did not initially disclose or explain.
By not fully revealing the true nature of their fees, the actual cost of their services adds up quickly and you wind up paying much more than you expected, or wanted, to pay.
Learn  how other business  formation companies  hide their fees.
At Harvard Business Services, Inc., you can rest assured there are no hidden fees. We do not conceal the additional costs you will discover with other business formation companies.



My Promise to you

If you form your Delaware Company through Harvard Business Services you will experience the fastest and friendliest way to start your business that you can imagine. We're special- ists in just this ONE thing, and we take pride in our desire and ability to do it BETTER than anyone out there. Excellence means getting it done quickly, getting it done correctly, and making you feel important, because you are!

Delaware Certificate of Good Standing

Order Your Certificate Now 
The Delaware Certificate of Good Standing is also known as a Certificate of Existence.
 
It is a letter provided by the Delaware Secretary of State that declares that a company is in good standing with the state. It specifically lists the incorporation date, good standing status for a corporation or LLC and whether taxes are current for a corporation or LLC.
 
 Order Your Certificate Now  
(If you already know you need to order a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing, please visit our Delaware Certificate of Good Standing order page. If you'd like to learn more, read on.)
 
Typically, a Certificate of Good Standing is required in order to open a corporate bank account, purchase or sell real estate, obtain a loan, obtain a Certificate of Authority to operate in another state, merge with another company and more.
 
Since the certified document verifies that a company is in good standing on the date it was issued, authorities will generally accept it as proof that the business is valid for 30-60 days after the issue date. Beyond 60 days, however, a new Certificate of Good Standing may need to be ordered.
 
Please click the buttons below to view a sample of a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing—with and without an Apostille.
 

 

Due to the time sensitivity of the Certificate, it is better to order one when you know you'll need it. If you are in a hurry, we can obtain a Certificate for you in two hours if necessary.
 
This certificate can be issued only for companies in good standing with the state of Delaware. If your company owes Delaware Franchise Taxes, they must be paid in full before we can order your Certificate of Good Standing.
 
You may email customer support, call 1-800-345-2677 or live chat with a specialist to determine if your company owes a tax balance.
 
To order a Certificate of Good Standing for your corporation or LLC, please view our pricing options, which start at $99, and then click on the yellow button below:

When Is It Due?
How Do I Calculate My Franchise Tax?
Do I Need to Submit Anything Else With My Payment?
Is My Franchise Tax the Same As My Annual Registered Agent Fee?
What Do I Do After Paying My Franchise Tax?




What Is Delaware Franchise Tax?
The Franchise Tax is the fee imposed by the state of Delaware for the right or privilege to own a Delaware company. The tax has no bearing on income or company activity—it is simply required by the state of Delaware to maintain the good standing status of your company.
 
The term "Franchise Tax" does not imply that your company is a franchise business. 



When Is It Due?
The due date of your tax varies, depending on your company type.
 
The Franchise Tax for a corporation is due by March 1 of every year. If the tax is not paid on or before March 1, the state imposes a $125 late penalty, plus a monthly interest fee of 1.5 percent.
 
The Franchise Tax for a Delaware LLC is due by June 1 of every year. The limited partnership (LP) Franchise Tax is also due by June 1 of every year. If the tax is not paid on or before June 1, the state imposes a $200 late penalty, plus a monthly interest fee of 1.5 percent.
 
Corporations, LLCs and LPs are taxed in arrears, meaning the tax due by each due date is for the previous calendar year.



How Do I Calculate My Franchise Tax?
The Franchise Tax for a Delaware limited liability company (LLC) or Delaware limited partnership (LP) is a flat annual rate of $300 as of July 1, 2014.
 
The Franchise Tax for a corporation is a little more complicated. It is based on your corporation type and the number of authorized shares your company has. The total cost of the Franchise Tax is comprised of an annual report fee and the actual tax due.
 
A non-stock/non-profit company is considered exempt with the state of Delaware. This type of company does not pay the annual tax but must file and pay the annual report fee. The annual report fee is $25 per year.
 
A corporation having 5,000 authorized shares or less is considered a minimum stock corporation. The annual report fee is $50 and the tax is $175 as of July 1, 2014, for a total of $225 per year.
 
A corporation having 5,001 authorized shares or more is considered a maximum stock corporation. The annual report fee is $50 and the tax would be somewhere between $200 and $180,000 per year.
 
There are two methods to calculate a maximum stock company's Franchise Tax. They are:


The Authorized Shares Method
 
The state of Delaware uses this method to initially calculate your taxes. This method is calculated based on the number of authorized shares. The calculation is as follows:

5,000 shares or less: $175 (as of July 1, 2014)
5,001 - 10,000 shares: $250 (as of July 1, 2014)
Additional 10,000 shares or portion thereof: add $75
The maximum annual tax is $180,000

 
Don't forget to add the $50 annual report fee to the Franchise Tax after it is calculated.
 


The Assumed Par Value Capital Method
The state of Delaware allows you to pay the lower of the two calculation methods. Therefore, if you receive a bill from Delaware for tens of thousands of dollars, it may be in your best interest to try calculating your Franchise Tax with the assumed par value capital method.
 
In order to utilize this filing method, you will need to provide the company's total gross assets (as reported on the Form 1120, Schedule L) and the total number of issued shares. Many times the tax is then calculated to the minimum payment of $350 Franchise Tax plus the $50 annual report fee.
 
The calculation used for this method is more complex. Please contact our office if you would like a copy of the calculation emailed to you. We will be happy to help you with this calculation.



How Do I Pay My Franchise Tax?
We make it easy to pay your Franchise Tax online.
 
As your Registered Agent,we will send you tax reminders both by mail and email, well in advance of the due date. We offer a tax filing service for a small fee of $49 plus your Franchise Tax. We also offer an online discounted filing fee that ranges from $29 to $59, depending on when the online payment is submitted.
 
Payments can be submitted via our online Franchise Tax payment form.
 
You can also email or fax (302- 645-1280) us your LLC/LP Franchise Tax worksheet or your corporation Franchise Tax worksheet. If you would like to make your payment by phone, call us at 800-345-2677, Ext. 6904.
 
 
 




 
Do I Need to Submit Anything Else With My Payment?
Yes. Corporations must complete an annual report along with their Franchise Tax payment. This report must list the company's physical address (not a P.O. box and not your Registered Agent's address); the name and physical address of at least one director; and, if there are any officers, the name, title and physical address of one of the officers.
 
If the tax is being calculated with the assumed par value capital method, the gross assets and issued shares are also to be listed. If you decide to pay your Delaware Franchise Tax for a corporation with us over the phone, the annual report would then need to be separately submitted to us by email, fax or mail.



Is My Franchise Tax the Same As My Annual Registered Agent Fee?
The Delaware Franchise Tax and the Registered Agent Fee are two separate, unrelated fees. The annual Franchise Tax is imposed by the state of Delaware. The annual Registered Agent Fee is paid to Harvard Business Services, Inc. to act as an agent for your entity in the state .
 
Our annual Registered Agent Fee is $50 per year, and is due on the anniversary month of the formation of your company.  It is the lowest Registered Agent fee in the industry, and it is guaranteed to remain fixed at $50 per year, as long as the fee is paid on time and your company remains in good standing with the state of Delaware.
 
Learn more about the Delaware Franchise Tax in this short video:
 




 
What Do I Do After Paying My Franchise Tax?
After paying Franchise Tax, many business owners require a Delaware Certificate of Good Standing.
 
A Certificate of Good Standing is a document sent directly from the Delaware Secretary of State certifying the date the company was formed in the state of Delaware, that the company is current with all Delaware taxes and that the company is in good standing.
 
This is not the same as your annual report and will not mention internal company information, such as director or officer details.
 
We can assist you in obtaining this document. To purchase a Certificate of Good Standing, please visit our Good Standing order page.
 
If you have any additional questions or concerns about the Delaware Franchise Tax, please feel free to call 1-800-345-2677, Ext. 6904 or email us.
