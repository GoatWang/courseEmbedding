Material

MaterialBathroom sinks come in a wide array of materials.  Selecting the right material can add depth and character to your bathroom.

The most common and preferred material for bathroom sinks is vitreous china, because of its variety in color and its versatility.
Copper sinks are a growing trend, not only because of its pleasing aesthetics, but also because of its natural antibacterial properties.

Sink GaugeShort of paying $1000's, 16-gauge stainless steel is as thick as sinks come.  16-gauge stainless steel is extraordinarily durable, giving you peace of mind that your sink will never bow or dent.  Furthermore, Kraus sinks are constructed using T-304 stainless steel. Highly corrosion-resistant due to its increased chromium (18%) and nickel (10%) contents, T-304 is far superior to the cheaper T-409 steel commonly used for sinks.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, FaucetDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require FaucetDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at FaucetDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					FaucetDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. FaucetDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Why don't we show the price?

					Like many retailers, FaucetDirect.com can choose to set its own prices independently. And even though manufacturers require FaucetDirect.com and other retailers to display a product's "minimum advertised price" (or MAP), the retailer can choose to sell for less than that. But the price must be conveyed in other ways, and each individual manufacturer's MAP policy determines where the price can be seen.
				

					To see the price for this product at FaucetDirect.com, you'll need to place it in your shopping cart, and maybe even proceed to final checkout. If you're not ready to buy the product, simply remove it from the cart.
				

					FaucetDirect.com apologizes for any inconvenience. We'd just like to offer you the chance to save extra money while we adhere to manufacturers' MAP policies. FaucetDirect.com is also working to educate manufacturers on how their policies impact customers and their buying behavior.

Asset Allocation: Our Investment Suitability Process
Asset Allocation is the mix between stocks and bonds in an investment portfolio. The determination of where each client falls along this continuum is a highly individual process. It will reflect an evaluation of a client’s long term financial goals, including:

need for current income and short-term liquidity
return expectations and time horizon
tax related issues when appropriate
willingness and ability to withstand market volatility

Most Recent Client Review 
 " if you are looking for a one stop supplier of fresh juices and dairy beverages geared towards schools and institutions, then look no further. m&b products have been providing our school with healthy juices and dairy drinks for over a dozen years. The price point on all products is at or below market standards and the kids love them. The low sugar content combined with the nutritional value sets their products apart from competitors. to top it off, they are one of the most eco friendly manufacturers of juice and dairy products in the world. the family run business is a staple in the industry and a pleasure to work with."
