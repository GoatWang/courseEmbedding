 TETRA Water Management provides treatment, transfer, and storage services to deliver clean fresh, flow back, and produced water that meets demanding specifications for hydraulic fracturing and unconventional (shale plays) well completions. Through better technologies and a comprehensive solution, including selection, analysis, treatment, transfer, storage, recycling, and environmental risk mitigation and operational excellence, TETRA’s water management personnel are able to design and determine specific environmentally friendly solutions for the unique needs of each customer well site in order to maximize operational performance and efficiency. TETRA has extensive experience in all major North American oil and gas shale plays. 






















Treatment
Fracing operations need a clean, frac fluid downhole that is bacteria, scale, and corrosion-free, compatible with other frac chemicals, and environmentally friendly by being quick acting and quick degrading. 
More Information



Storage
TETRA's storage solutions ensure drilling and completion operations have a sufficient water supply onsite and on-demand. We offer designs for smaller, above-ground storage tanks (ASTs). All of TETRA's above-ground storage solutions are easy to assemble and engineered to the highest standards. Our operators are certified and trained to install impoundments safely and reliably. Our above-ground impoundments are reusable, versatile, and easy to relocate. For smaller volumes, we utilize our heavy steel-paneled, circular water corrals.
More Information





















Transfer
Transfer and blending go hand-in-hand for an optimal frac fluid, since any treatment depends on having a continuous homogenous supply of water. TETRA delivers clean frac water through patented and proprietary, specifically engineered technologies, which not only transfer water, but also monitor and validate performance and make feed rate adjustments “on-the-fly” in a cost-effective and safe manner.

Since 1981, TETRA Technologies, Inc. has served the global oil and gas industry with dedication, focus, and integrity. Since our inception, TETRA has had one goal…to deliver the best quality products and services based on innovative technologies, and best practices. We began in 1981 as a pioneer in the burgeoning completion fluids industry. Armed with new technology and a passion to succeed, our founders proved that focusing on customer needs positions us as a leader and supplier of choice in this market. 

To secure a guaranteed resource for our customers, we chose to make a substantial investment in the first clear brine fluid manufacturing facility dedicated to the oil and gas industry. Oil and gas operators cannot afford to take chances when drilling in the ultradeep basins around the world. They cannot risk damaging their payzone with an off-the-shelf clear brine fluid. TETRA offers customized, cost-effective, formation-specific fluids. Since we manufacture the completion fluids we sell, our customers have supply assurance to have what they need, when they need it, no matter the volume. 
TETRA’s Fourchon CBF facility is one of the largest on the Gulf Coast, providing quick turnaround and advanced fluid management service. Our many facilities serve, not only deepwater operators, but onshore and inland waterway customers as well. Speed and efficiency are coupled with the technology to blend our fluids to the condition found in any well. By controlling and monitoring the chemistry of our products, from manufacturing to placement in the wellbore, TETRA’s unique ability to produce fluids specially for our customer’s well conditions, sets us apart for all others in the industry. Since our customers need productive, trouble-free completions, our trained fluid engineers are able to design the optimum program for a successful displacement to provide a clean wellbore. 
Our customers also want innovative, cost-effective, frac water management solutions, including treatment, transfer, and storage. To meet that need, we manage the entire lifecycle of the frac water, keeping it reusable, utilizing technology, equipment, and best practices that respect the environment. With the largest fleet of onshore flow back well testing equipment in the USA and an extensive international fleet, TETRA has amassed a complete inventory of well testing technology and equipment that optimizes production through improving reservoir performance. 
The Compression Division provides its products and services to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, pipeline transmission, and storage companies, operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States. Our strategy is to compete on the basis of superior services at a competitive price and to deliver significant increases in the value that results from the use of its services, its superior customer service, its highly trained field personnel, and the quality of the compressor packages it uses to provide services.
When wells run dry, TETRA provides the highest quality in construction, diving, cutting, plugging, abandonment, and decommissioning solutions and has been doing so since 1994.

                        About us
                    


TETRA Technologies, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1981 and is composed of five reporting segments organized into four divisions – Fluids, Production Testing, Compression, and Offshore.   We manage our operations through five operating segments: Fluids, Production Testing, Compression, Offshore Services, and Maritech, organized in four divisions. Prior to the CSI Acquisition during the three months ended September 30, 2014, we organized our segments in three divisions. Following the CSI Acquisition, Production Testing and Compression are now reflected as separate divisions.   Our Fluids Division manufactures and markets clear brine fluids, additives, and associated products and services to the oil and gas industry for use in well drilling, completion, and workover operations in the United States and in certain countries in Latin America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The Division also markets liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities or purchased from third-party suppliers to a variety of markets outside the energy industry. The Fluids Division also provides domestic onshore oil and gas operators with comprehensive water management services.   Our Production Testing Division provides after-frac flow back, production well testing, offshore rig cooling, and other associated services in many of the major oil and gas producing regions in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, as well as in certain basins in certain regions in South America, Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Australia.   The Compression Division is a provider of compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transportation, processing, and storage. The Division also sells standard and custom designed compressor packages and engine-driven oilfield fluid pump systems, and provides aftermarket services and compressor parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. The Division provides these compression services and equipment to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, transmission, and storage companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States as well as in a number of foreign countries, including Mexico, Canada, and Argentina.   Our Offshore Division consists of two operating segments: Offshore Services and Maritech. The Offshore Services segment provides (1) downhole and subsea services such as well plugging and abandonment and workover services, (2) decommissioning and certain construction services utilizing heavy lift barges and various cutting technologies with regard to offshore oil and gas production platforms and pipelines, and (3) conventional and saturation diving services.
