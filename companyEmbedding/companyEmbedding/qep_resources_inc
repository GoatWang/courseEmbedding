SummaryQEP's stock has been under strong pressure. The decline may prompt the company to accelerate its portfolio repositioning program to highlight value.The company's legacy portfolio is characterized by high-quality, marketable assets.Using the current futures curve as a macro assumption and assuming three major sale transactions are executed in the next two years, the stock could see a 50% appreciation.The recent sale by Halcon Resources (HK) of its entire legacy portfolio to fund a strategic shift towards the Permian provides a case study that may be relevant to several other stocks in the sector. As a reminder, Halcon shares jumped ~50% on the day of the Williston Basin sale announcement. Given that many companies have participated in the land grab in the Permian in the last few years, a wave of divestments where operators put on the market maturing core properties in other basins or attempt to dispose of higher-cost-of-supply tier 1 assets will be a continuing significant trend in the near future. QEP Resources (QEP) is one of the situations where further re-allocation of capital from legacy assets to the Permian can provide a catalyst for a material upward re-pricing of the stock. Given that QEP shares have suffered a steep decline in the last twelve months, losing ~45% of their value, strategic initiatives appear much needed to unlock value. A case can be made that divestitures could help to eliminate the portfolioâs âconglomerate discountâ and lead to a multiple expansion at the same time. In the aftermath, QEP could transform itself into essentially a single-basin operator with a significant footprint in the Permian Core, top-quality acreage and re-energized production momentum. Disappointing Price Performance May Accelerate Strategic Initiatives Despite a high-quality asset base and ample liquidity, QEP shares are trading below the level they were trading at during the industry's credit crunch in early 2016. 


 (Source: Google Finance) Several factors have likely contributed to this weak performance:  The entire sector has been under pressure as, in my interpretation, the market finally came to realize that the price trajectory for crude oil in the near term is more likely to be "L-shaped" rather than "U-shaped," to a great degree driven by the remarkable success of U.S. shale oil Specific to QEP, while the company was a relatively early mover in the Permian, acquiring a top-quality acreage Countyline block at a highly attractive, in retrospect, price, its further progress in repositioning capital to the most promising province has been slow. The more recent Mustang acquisition, which was high-priced, appears to have achieved little in terms of generating a price uplift for the stock - even though the quality of the Mustang block is exceptional, the high cost per location takes a heavy toll on future returns. Most recently, the stock took a hit after the Q1 earnings update, as the back-end loaded production growth in the Permian in 2017 seemed to surprise the market.  These factors notwithstanding, the company's portfolio is characterized by a generally high asset quality. However, many of those assets are likely to end up "stranded," as QEP will be forced to allocate capital to its core-of-the-core inventory. This consideration leads me to believe that the only way to eliminate the "conglomerate discount" is by monetizing tier 1 assets, reducing leverage and bringing forward cash flows from top-tier assets. The Sale Of Pinedale Provides The Most Imminent Catalyst QEP is in the process of completing the auction process for its Pinedale operation, a legacy natural gas-producing asset in the Rockies. Based on my understanding, the process is currently in the second round of bidding and a definitive purchase & sale agreement could be announced as early as in the next few weeks (possibly, next week, prior or concurrently with the second quarter earnings call). The fact that QEP is working on divesting Pinedale has been telegraphed to the market and the transaction is anticipated. I must note that QEP's stock price held up better than some of its peers in the last month. This relative resilience may be driven by the anticipation of an imminent announcement.
 

(Source: Google Finance) QEP's Q1 2017 net production from Pinedale averaged ~240 MMcfe/d (12% liquids). QEP is currently running a one-rig operated program. The company's AFE well costs are approximately $2.7 million per well, with costs associated with facilities and plunger lift adding ~$0.2 million. Production has been on a high single-digit decline trend for six quarters, reflecting the reduced capital allocation. Based on management's comments at the end of last year, the Pinedale asset was contributing ~$125 million to the company's EBITDA and was producing significant free cash flow. 

 (Source: QEP Resources, June 2017) While the announcement should not come as much of a surprise to investors closely following the company, it would provide certainty and may help to move the stock higher, assuming the price received is respectable. I do not rule out a scenario where the properties attain a valuation close to $1 billion, but currently see a sub-$1 billion outcome, in the $700-$900 million range, as more likely. In any event, the proceeds will be very material in the context of the company's significantly shrunk market capitalization, which currently stands at just $2.2 billion. Ultra Petroleum (UPL), the offset operator in Pinedale, would be the natural buyer of the properties. However, even after its Chapter 11 restructuring, Ultra remains over-levered and, arguably, would need to raise a significant amount of equity to fund the purchase. It is certainly possible that Ultra teams up with a financial investor to bid on the assets. The benefit of such structure to UPL would be in maximizing its advantage of being the established offset operator (via an operator's incentive) while reducing the potential downside associated with a large equity raise. Ultra could also offer its stock as partial consideration to QEP.
 Regardless of Ultraâs participation, the asset is likely to attract significant interest and multiple bids, due to the attractive, relatively low-decline nature of the mature portion of production and reasonable running room in terms of the remaining drilling inventory. The selection of Pinedale as divestiture asset is logical. The acreage has been under active development by QEP for quite some time. While the remaining drilling inventory is sufficient for many years of decline-management drilling, the asset is clearly approaching the mature phase of its life cycle. In addition, two years ago QEP sold its large midstream business, including gathering and processing in the Green River Basin area, to Tesoro Logistics for ~$2.5 billion, giving up its midstream integration advantage in Pinedale. After the Pinedale divestiture, QEP will maintain significant optionality in natural gas via its top-quality Haynesville position, which is still far from development maturity. (QEP is also advancing an emerging deep Mesaverde natural gas play in the Uinta Basin, but the play does not have the same significance to the portfolio as the other two natural gas assets.) The divestiture of Pinedale will very likely lead to another acquisition in the Permian, in part driven by the ability to avoid tax leakage by using a section 1031 like kind exchange election. QEP has several months to identify acquisition opportunities and the work is likely well underway. Under tax rules, QEP will have 45 days after the closing of the Pinedale divestiture to submit a specific list of potential acquisition targets with a total combined value of up to two times the Pinedale divestiture price and will have 180 days after the closing of the Pinedale divestiture to close the acquisition. While these requirements are restrictive, smaller asset transactions can be relatively easy to execute within these constraints. With these considerations in mind, I anticipate QEPâs footprint in the Permian to increase meaningfully, with material asset acquisitions announced by year-end.
 I also anticipate QEPâs production growth in the Permian to finally gain momentum in the second half of this year, after a pause in the first half that disappointed the market, as the company brings on production large groups on wells that it completes using its âtank-styleâ development approach, i.e. simultaneously completing the entire set of wells in the formation, to avoid future infill drilling. A Bigger Catalyst On The Horizon The sale of Pinedale is a development that is visible to the market (or at least to focused observers). However, following the Pinedale initiative, I anticipate that QEP may undertake a much larger strategic move that is not broadly anticipated and would have the power to re-price the stock significantly higher. I expect that QEP will pursue the sale of its largest producing asset, the Bakken. As demonstrated by Halconâs $1.4 billion Williston Basin divestiture, high-quality assets in the Bakken can receive firm valuations even in a challenging commodity price environment. QEPâs Bakken properties are of top quality. While the companyâs core-of-the-core South Antelope block is maturing, the acreage still offers an extensive, economic development inventory. The buyer would also have significant running room developing QEPâs FBIR acreage. 

(Source: QEP Resources, June 2017) I discussed key metrics of Halconâs properties in my recent Halcon Energy post (the link is provided at the top of this note). QEPâs acreage position is comparable in size to the one being sold by Halcon but includes a higher percentage of core-of-the-core drilling units. QEPâs best acreage also has the advantage of being blocked up. At the same time, the existing production from QEPâs assets is almost two times greater than the production from Halconâs properties.
 Given the significant flowing volumes, I expect the asset to receive a valuation possibly as high as $2.5 billion if offered for sale in the current environment. I anticipate the divestiture of the Bakken to be a 2018 event. Given that every year of drilling brings this asset closer to its mature phase, it appears logical to expect that QEP would prefer to market the Bakken earlier rather than later, assuming the M&A market environment is favorable. The sale could accomplish several objectives for QEP:  delever the balance sheet; provide funds for another material acquisition in the Permian; fuel a powerful production growth momentum in the Permian.  Assuming Bakken is indeed divested, QEP would emerge as a much smaller entity. However, the ânewâ QEP would be able to offer investors a path to a higher stock price, featuring an iron-clad balance sheet, ample liquidity, rapid production growth, and high-quality, concentrated asset base in the most economic shale oil province in the U.S. Another Potential Catalyst The Bakken is not the only significant asset that QEP could potentially offer for sale. Given the increasing prominence of the Permian in the portfolio â which is the apparent strategy â QEP may arrive at a conclusion that the disposition of the Haynesville may also make financial sense. Given the assetâs top quality and extensive development potential, one can again expect a meaningful price to be received in the monetization. 




 (Source: QEP Resources, June 2017) Based on precedent transactions and taking into consideration asset-specific attributes, I expect the Haynesville to receive a valuation of as much as $600-$700 million. A Smaller Catalyst QEPâs vast asset portfolio also includes several properties that are still in early stages of evaluation. I have already mentioned the Lower Mesaverde play in the Uinta. The Woodford play in Winkler County, TX in the Permian is another such prospect. I anticipate that on its second quarter earnings call on July 27, QEP will discuss the results of the second test well that the company recently drilled and completed on the acreage. As a reminder, the first test well did show a meaningful initial oil production rate but experienced a rapid production decline. The company attributes the wellâs failure to barium sulphate precipitation caused by the completion fluid, which clogged the submersible pump and the near-wellbore fracture system. QEP hopes that the problem will be addressed by a fluid design modification. Given the current price environment, the bar for exploration success in oil shales is set quite high. The formation must be truly prolific to compete for capital. However, if successful, the Woodford test could create value for QEP, given the companyâs significant acreage position in the play, ~45,000 net acres. 

 Capital Redeployment Could Offer A Path To A Price Recovery At the end of first quarter, QEPâs total debt was ~$2.0 billion and cash position was $338 million. The market value of equity is ~$2.2 billion, using share price of $9.39. To demonstrate the stockâs re-pricing potential, I will use the following illustrative scenario:  QEP sells Pinedale for $750 million and uses the proceeds and cash on hand to expand its footprint in the Permian, bringing its total core acreage position to ~60,000 top-quality, blocked up acres and increasing production to over 20,000 Boe/d by the end of 2017 (I assume total purchase price of ~$1.1 billion and per-acre price of ~$35,000 for an acreage block in a core area). QEP sells its Bakken operation for $2.3 billion after tax and uses the proceeds to repay its entire debt (some prepayment premia would apply). QEP sells its Haynesville operation for $600 million after tax and uses the proceeds to fund an accelerated development program in the Permian in 2018-2020 (or $200 million per year on average in outspending). 
 Under this illustrative scenario, I anticipate the companyâs production to exceed 50,000 Boe/d by the end of 2020. For the simplicity of this illustration, I have used a debt-free structure and assumed no equity issuance. Based on these metrics and taking into consideration high acreage quality in the Permian, I can see the market valuing QEPâs equity at $4+ billion by 2020, using the current strip price as a commodity scenario. Discounting back and taking into consideration execution risks, I value this upside at as much as $12-13 per share currently, a significant premium to the current stock price. In Conclusionâ¦ QEPâs deep stock decline may put pressure on the company to accelerate strategic initiatives with the objective of highlighting the portfolioâs value. In my view, in the current M&A market environment, a capital re-deployment into the Permian can unlock significant value, with a 50%+ price upside within two years, without assuming any improvement in commodity prices relative to the current futures curve.

Oil and Gas Stock Roundup: Crude Wobbles Again, Causing More Pain for Drillers
Crude renewed its slump this week, closing below $45 a barrel and fueling a deep sell-off in shares of California Resources, Sanchez Energy, Obsidian Energy, and QEP Resources.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)



            
            Jul 8, 2017 at 10:35AM
            
            





What happened
Crude oil's longest winning streak in 10 months came to an abrupt halt this week after Russia said it wouldn't consider making deeper cuts in its output to help prop up oil prices. That refusal, when combined with government data showing that U.S. production rose another 88,000 barrels a day last week, sent oil down more than 4% on the week and below $45 per barrel.
That decline in the price of oil hit weaker drillers hard. Several plunged double digits on the week, led by California Resources (NYSE:CRC), Sanchez Energy (NYSE:SN), Obsidian Energy (NYSE:OBE), and QEP Resources (NYSE:QEP), according to data fromÂ S&P Market Intelligence.

So what
California Resources led the way lower, plunging nearly 25% over the past week. Driving the selling is the fact that California Resources needs oil to be much higher to survive, let alone thrive. Despite making progress in shoring up its balance sheet over the past year, the company has a significant debt problem. According to its estimates, its debt-to-EBITDAX ratio will be more than 7.0 this year, and that's assuming crude averages $55 per barrel. Furthermore, California Resources expectsÂ to spend more than half its cash flow on interest expenses this year, leaving it with little left over to finance capital investments that would maintain and grow output. While the company doesn't have any near-term debt maturities, it needs oil to rally significantly in the coming years so it can stay afloat. 
Sanchez Energy also fell sharply, ending the week down more than 15%. Weighing on the stock is the fact that the Eagle Ford Shale-focused driller also has too much debt for current crude prices. The company's plan was to grow into its balance sheet by expanding output more than 20% per year, which would drive its leverage ratio below 3.0 next year. However, there are a couple of problems with that plan. First, Sanchez Energy based its budget on crude averaging $55 per barrel. Furthermore, a 3.0 leverage ratio is still well above the industry average of 2.0 times debt to EBITDA. Given where crude is these days, Sanchez Energy needs to slow its drilling pace and pay down debt so it doesn't get crushed if oil stays lower for longer. 
Obsidian Energy, formerly Penn West Petroleum, also fell double digits this week due to lower oil prices. While the company does have a stronger balance sheet thanks to its decision to sell a slew of assets last year, it's not in the position where it can thrive at current prices. For example, it expects to deliver double-digit production growth this year while living within cash flow at $40 oil. However, Obsidian EnergyÂ can't sustain that rate over the long term since it can only increase output by 3% annually starting next year, and that'sÂ assuming it spent all the cash flow it generates at $50 oil. Given that some analysts see oil heading much lower in 2018, Obsidian could struggle to maintain output in the future. 
QEP Resources is also falling under the weight of lower oil because it can't support its ambitious growth plan at current prices. For 2017, QEP Resources intends on spending up to $1 billion drilling and completing new wells, primarily in the Permian Basin, which would drive its oil output up 6% compared to last year. However, it's burning through cash to finance that plan, using more than $100 million of its cash balance in the first quarter alone. If QEP Resources keeps it up, it'll be out of cash by the end of the year, which would require the company to start tapping its credit facility and add more debt to an already stretched balance sheet. That's something investors don't want to see it doing in an environment where oil is falling as a result of too much supply. 





Now what
The longer crude oil stays below the mid-$50-a-barrel range that most drillers expected, the more likely that weaker producers will need to start cutting back on spending. If they don't, these companies run the risk of piling on more debt to pump out oil that the market doesn't need, which could have disastrous consequences down the road. Given that tight situation, investors should steer clear of oil companies with high debt levels and the inability to finance growth within cash flow at lower oil prices, because their stocks could still have more downside if oil doesn't improve.

OJ Simpson: In his own words







21/07/2017 







"I think it will be a lot like life was between 1995 and 2007", Toobin said.Simpson responded emotionally, saying, "Thank you, thank you, thank you". He's lived there as inmate 1027820 since he was convicted and sentenced in 2008.The former National Football League hero, TV pitchman and movie star, now 70, stands a good chance of being granted parole when he appears before the Nevada Parole Board via videolink.Given the circumstances of the crime, and normal sentencing guide lines for such an offense, Simpson appears to have been overcharged and over sentenced as payback for his being acquitted of the brutal murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman.Asked what he planned to do if released, Simpson said he would move to Florida to be close to two of his four adult children.During Thursday's hearing, the charisma and charm that once made Simpson one of the most popular figures in American pop culture was clearly on display.Despite previous murder charges against Simpson, commissioners did not challenge his assertion that he had spent a largely conflict-free life and had always been "pretty good to people". He said he suffered four heart attacks and severe financial losses as a result of the robbery but later forgave Simpson.In Nevada, a prisoner is not required to express remorse to be granted parole. The Parole Board felt that nine years was enough. To them, nine years wasn't almost enough.As with all things O.J., there's been a tremendous media interest in the parole hearing.
QEP Resources, Inc. (NYSE:QEP) Cut to "Hold" at Deutsche Bank AG
					The pipeline company reported ($0.14) EPS for the quarter, topping the Zacks' consensus estimate of ($0.21) by $0.07. On average, equities research analysts forecast that QEP Resources will post ($0.74) EPS for the current year.
				Simpson will likely make money selling interviews and memorabilia, Toobin said. The parole hearing was broadcast everywhere from ESPN to BBC World. Simpson's hearing also was a Twitter U.S. trending topic, a phenomenon that didn't exist in 1995. Simpson will now be released on October 1 of this year. But it's still clear: One reason we cared then and now is television. J.: "Made in America", received in February the Oscar for best documentary.- July 2007: A federal bankruptcy judge awards the rights to a book by Simpson, in which he discusses how he could have committed the killings, to Goldman's family as partial payment of the judgment.The story touched on crime, domestic violence, race, celebrity and sport - a powerful and intoxicating mix.Scotto said he visits or talks with Simpson every few months.The handsome and charismatic athlete was also a "Monday Night Football" commentator, sprinted through airports in Hertz rental-car commercials and built a Hollywood career with roles in the "Naked Gun" comedies and other movies."In many ways, sadly, we certainly have not heard the last of O.J.", he concluded.Thursday's parole hearing follows renewed interest in Simpson's story, which was explored previous year in the award-winning documentary "O.J.: Made in America" and the FX true-crime drama "The People v. O.J. Simpson".But he told the parole board he's sorry for the incident, and apologized to the lone surviving victim, Bruce Fromong. But she said the letters against his parole all cited his murder trial and she said that would not and could not be considered.When the final vote to grant parole was read after parole commissioners deliberated just over 30 minutes, Simpson lowered his head and then raised it up with a big smile.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.
Zacks Style Scores Education - Learn more about the Zacks Style Scores


The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
