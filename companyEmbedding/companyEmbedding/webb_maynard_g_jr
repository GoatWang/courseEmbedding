Maynard G. Webb, Jr. (born 1955) is an American author and is the best-selling[2] author of Rebooting Work: Transform How You Work in the Age of Entrepreneurship,[3] a long-time technology executive and angel investor,[4] a board member of Salesforce.com,[5] VISA,[6] Everwise[7] and Chairman of the Board of Directors at Yahoo!.[8] Webb founded Webb Investment Network in 2010[9] and is the former CEO of LiveOps and former COO of eBay.[10]

Rebooting Work[edit]
With Carlye Adler, Webb authored a New York Times best-selling[2] book entitled Rebooting Work: Transform How You Work in the Age of Entrepreneurship, which was published in January 2013.[3] The book focuses on how work models developed a century ago are out of sync today, identifies four mindsets about work, and explains how to leverage technology to change how we work.[3] Over the years, Webb has blogged about entrepreneurship and work in the Internet economy.[11]
Education and career[edit]
Webb received his Bachelor's Degree in criminal justice from Florida Atlantic University.[11] After graduation, he took a security guard job at IBM.[12] He later held management and leadership positions at Bay Networks, Quantum Corporation, and Thomas-Conrad Corporation and was Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer at Gateway, Inc.
From 1999 to 2006, Webb held various titles at eBay, including President of Technology and Chief Operating Officer.[10][13] During his tenure, eBay grew from $140 million in revenue to over $4.5 billion in 2005 as the employee base expanded from 250 to more than 12,000.[14] Webb served as CEO of LiveOps from 2006 to 2011, a cloud-based call center services company.[13] During that time, LiveOps was named one of Forbes’ Ten Hot Start-Ups (2009),[15] expanded into the enterprise market, generated more capital than it had originally raised, and expanded its board with executives from Symantec, Hewlett-Packard, PeopleSoft, and eBay.[16]
Investments[edit]
Webb is a long-time angel investor who has helped fund such companies as Okta, Rypple, Badgeville, Hipmunk, Nebula, Luminate, SocialEyes, and Diffbot.[13] In 2010, he founded Webb Investment Network (WIN) for early-stage investing in ecommerce, mobile, cloud computing, and enterprise startups.[4] Startups that WIN funds have access to a network of 89 industry experts from companies such as Google, PayPal, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard.[4][9] The network was built from Webb’s business connections.[4] WIN is considered to be part of a trend of smaller, early-stage funds that are indirectly challenging the traditional venture capital model.[4]
Philanthropy[edit]
Webb and his wife Irene founded the Webb Family Foundation in 2004,[12] an organization dedicated to “promoting meritocracy through helping underdogs in society meet their full potential.”[17] Through grants, the foundation has supported disaster relief, youth mentoring, cancer research, education, and other organizations.[18]

Rebooting Work[edit]
With Carlye Adler, Webb authored a New York Times best-selling[2] book entitled Rebooting Work: Transform How You Work in the Age of Entrepreneurship, which was published in January 2013.[3] The book focuses on how work models developed a century ago are out of sync today, identifies four mindsets about work, and explains how to leverage technology to change how we work.[3] Over the years, Webb has blogged about entrepreneurship and work in the Internet economy.[11]
Education and career[edit]
Webb received his Bachelor's Degree in criminal justice from Florida Atlantic University.[11] After graduation, he took a security guard job at IBM.[12] He later held management and leadership positions at Bay Networks, Quantum Corporation, and Thomas-Conrad Corporation and was Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer at Gateway, Inc.
From 1999 to 2006, Webb held various titles at eBay, including President of Technology and Chief Operating Officer.[10][13] During his tenure, eBay grew from $140 million in revenue to over $4.5 billion in 2005 as the employee base expanded from 250 to more than 12,000.[14] Webb served as CEO of LiveOps from 2006 to 2011, a cloud-based call center services company.[13] During that time, LiveOps was named one of Forbes’ Ten Hot Start-Ups (2009),[15] expanded into the enterprise market, generated more capital than it had originally raised, and expanded its board with executives from Symantec, Hewlett-Packard, PeopleSoft, and eBay.[16]
Investments[edit]
Webb is a long-time angel investor who has helped fund such companies as Okta, Rypple, Badgeville, Hipmunk, Nebula, Luminate, SocialEyes, and Diffbot.[13] In 2010, he founded Webb Investment Network (WIN) for early-stage investing in ecommerce, mobile, cloud computing, and enterprise startups.[4] Startups that WIN funds have access to a network of 89 industry experts from companies such as Google, PayPal, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard.[4][9] The network was built from Webb’s business connections.[4] WIN is considered to be part of a trend of smaller, early-stage funds that are indirectly challenging the traditional venture capital model.[4]
Philanthropy[edit]
Webb and his wife Irene founded the Webb Family Foundation in 2004,[12] an organization dedicated to “promoting meritocracy through helping underdogs in society meet their full potential.”[17] Through grants, the foundation has supported disaster relief, youth mentoring, cancer research, education, and other organizations.[18]

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Maynard Webb





Born
1955 (age 61–62)


Education
Bachelor's Degree, Florida Atlantic University


Known for
Author, Rebooting Work: Transform How You Work in the Age of Entrepreneurship (2013)


Title
Chairman of Yahoo![1]
Founder of Webb Investment


Maynard G. Webb, Jr. (born 1955) is an American author and is the best-selling[2] author of Rebooting Work: Transform How You Work in the Age of Entrepreneurship,[3] a long-time technology executive and angel investor,[4] a board member of Salesforce.com,[5] VISA,[6] Everwise[7] and Chairman of the Board of Directors at Yahoo!.[8] Webb founded Webb Investment Network in 2010[9] and is the former CEO of LiveOps and former COO of eBay.[10]

Rebooting Work[edit]
With Carlye Adler, Webb authored a New York Times best-selling[2] book entitled Rebooting Work: Transform How You Work in the Age of Entrepreneurship, which was published in January 2013.[3] The book focuses on how work models developed a century ago are out of sync today, identifies four mindsets about work, and explains how to leverage technology to change how we work.[3] Over the years, Webb has blogged about entrepreneurship and work in the Internet economy.[11]
Education and career[edit]
Webb received his Bachelor's Degree in criminal justice from Florida Atlantic University.[11] After graduation, he took a security guard job at IBM.[12] He later held management and leadership positions at Bay Networks, Quantum Corporation, and Thomas-Conrad Corporation and was Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer at Gateway, Inc.
From 1999 to 2006, Webb held various titles at eBay, including President of Technology and Chief Operating Officer.[10][13] During his tenure, eBay grew from $140 million in revenue to over $4.5 billion in 2005 as the employee base expanded from 250 to more than 12,000.[14] Webb served as CEO of LiveOps from 2006 to 2011, a cloud-based call center services company.[13] During that time, LiveOps was named one of Forbes’ Ten Hot Start-Ups (2009),[15] expanded into the enterprise market, generated more capital than it had originally raised, and expanded its board with executives from Symantec, Hewlett-Packard, PeopleSoft, and eBay.[16]
Investments[edit]
Webb is a long-time angel investor who has helped fund such companies as Okta, Rypple, Badgeville, Hipmunk, Nebula, Luminate, SocialEyes, and Diffbot.[13] In 2010, he founded Webb Investment Network (WIN) for early-stage investing in ecommerce, mobile, cloud computing, and enterprise startups.[4] Startups that WIN funds have access to a network of 89 industry experts from companies such as Google, PayPal, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard.[4][9] The network was built from Webb’s business connections.[4] WIN is considered to be part of a trend of smaller, early-stage funds that are indirectly challenging the traditional venture capital model.[4]
Philanthropy[edit]
Webb and his wife Irene founded the Webb Family Foundation in 2004,[12] an organization dedicated to “promoting meritocracy through helping underdogs in society meet their full potential.”[17] Through grants, the foundation has supported disaster relief, youth mentoring, cancer research, education, and other organizations.[18]

Rebooting Work[edit]
With Carlye Adler, Webb authored a New York Times best-selling[2] book entitled Rebooting Work: Transform How You Work in the Age of Entrepreneurship, which was published in January 2013.[3] The book focuses on how work models developed a century ago are out of sync today, identifies four mindsets about work, and explains how to leverage technology to change how we work.[3] Over the years, Webb has blogged about entrepreneurship and work in the Internet economy.[11]
Education and career[edit]
Webb received his Bachelor's Degree in criminal justice from Florida Atlantic University.[11] After graduation, he took a security guard job at IBM.[12] He later held management and leadership positions at Bay Networks, Quantum Corporation, and Thomas-Conrad Corporation and was Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer at Gateway, Inc.
From 1999 to 2006, Webb held various titles at eBay, including President of Technology and Chief Operating Officer.[10][13] During his tenure, eBay grew from $140 million in revenue to over $4.5 billion in 2005 as the employee base expanded from 250 to more than 12,000.[14] Webb served as CEO of LiveOps from 2006 to 2011, a cloud-based call center services company.[13] During that time, LiveOps was named one of Forbes’ Ten Hot Start-Ups (2009),[15] expanded into the enterprise market, generated more capital than it had originally raised, and expanded its board with executives from Symantec, Hewlett-Packard, PeopleSoft, and eBay.[16]
Investments[edit]
Webb is a long-time angel investor who has helped fund such companies as Okta, Rypple, Badgeville, Hipmunk, Nebula, Luminate, SocialEyes, and Diffbot.[13] In 2010, he founded Webb Investment Network (WIN) for early-stage investing in ecommerce, mobile, cloud computing, and enterprise startups.[4] Startups that WIN funds have access to a network of 89 industry experts from companies such as Google, PayPal, Oracle, and Hewlett-Packard.[4][9] The network was built from Webb’s business connections.[4] WIN is considered to be part of a trend of smaller, early-stage funds that are indirectly challenging the traditional venture capital model.[4]
Philanthropy[edit]
Webb and his wife Irene founded the Webb Family Foundation in 2004,[12] an organization dedicated to “promoting meritocracy through helping underdogs in society meet their full potential.”[17] Through grants, the foundation has supported disaster relief, youth mentoring, cancer research, education, and other organizations.[18]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
