NagaCorp Ltd. ("The Company") is one of the world's most profitable gaming companies, and the largest gaming entertainment company in the Mekong Region. Its wholly-owned subsidiary NagaWorld owns, manages and operates Phnom Penh's only integrated hotel-casino entertainment complex, which owns a casino license with a 70-year tenure (until 2065) and a 41-year monopoly within a 200 km radius of Phnom Penh (until 2035).  
					The Company is the first gaming IPO on the Hong Kong Exchange, and is the first foreign-owned company with operations in Cambodia ever listed overseas. Since its listing in 2006 to date, NagaCorp has achieved much success in private-public sector cooperation. It has raised the international profile of its host country, contributing to local tourism Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and attracting Foreign Direct Investments (FDI). 
					Its founder and controlling shareholder Dr. Chen Lip Keong's emphasis on managing a "First-World Company in a Developing Nation" with transparency and compliance aligned to global best practices sets the standard of governance for the Company; in addition, over the years, the Company's achievement of strong financial success has declared high annual dividends and delivered growth to its shareholders.

Vince MartinLong/short equity, value, gamblingNagaCorp: Not Quite As Strong As It AppearsGaming revenue in Macau is plummeting, with the declines seemingly getting bigger by the day.
