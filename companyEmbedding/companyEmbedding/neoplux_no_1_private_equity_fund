Preqin Solutions









About Us









Preqin Solutions, formerly Baxon Solutions, is the leading innovator of cloud solutions to the Private Equity industry. We believe that the Private Equity industry deserves better software to help it manage data, and our firm aims to deliver simple functionality to enhance the quality of data and decision making tools available to portfolio companies through to the asset owners. Central to this objective, is the belief that these tools should be accessible to all market participants, and we aim to accommodate all firm sizes through a scalable pricing model and a lightweight solution that doesn’t require significant client resource to manage.
Established in 2005, we have built an extensive in-house team of experienced consultants and financial analysts and accumulated a wealth of client and implementation best practices from our global customer base. We provide a consultative approach to fully assess your business challenges to configure our solution to your needs.
Preqin Solutions is a subsidiary of Preqin Limited, the leading source of information for the alternative assets industry, providing data and analysis via online databases, publications and bespoke data requests. Preqin’s products and services are utilized by more than 47,000 professionals located in over 90 countries for a range of activities including investor relations, fundraising and marketing, and market research. Founded in 2003, the company operates from offices in London, Singapore, New York, Austin, San Francisco, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong and Manila.
Why Preqin Solutions
We are wholly focused on supporting and enhancing the portfolio management process, allowing integration with legacy and best of breed (BOB) systems. Our solution offers consistency and complete transparency in line with private equity directives such as AIFMD and Form PF and private equity industry alliances such as Altexchange and InvestEurope.
Our cloud solution offers significant time savings through automating manual processes and has proven to reduce the entire reporting process by over 45%.
No new hardware, software or IT support is required and the implementation period is 8-12 weeks, by far the fastest in the industry. Most users require less than an hour of training.
We believe that the future relies on an agnostic web interface. It is not a file-based system relying on an Excel add-in. For those who choose to, it can also interface with Excel however.
Finally, through the integration of Preqin data we have the unique ability to contextualize your fund performance relative to public and private markets. More than just the data comes the insight through having access to the expectations of over 10,000 market participants given Preqin’s global presence

ACUSHNET IPO 
McDermott represented Korean private equity funds Mirae Asset Private Equity Partners Fund VII, Neoplux No.1 Private Equity 
Fund, and Woori Blackstone Korea Opportunity Fund in the sale of over 22 million shares of common stock in the selling 
shareholder only initial public offering (IPO) of Acushnet Holdings Corp. (NYSE:GOLF), the global leader in the design, 
development, manufacture, and distribution of performance driven golf products and owner of the Titleist and Footjoy golf 
equipment and apparel brands.  McDermott also represented the selling shareholders in the negotiation of registration and sell 
down rights with respect to Acushnet common stock that the funds continue to hold after the completion of the IPO. 
In a related transaction immediately following the pricing of the IPO, McDermott represented Mirae Asset Private Equity Partners 
Fund VII and Neoplux No.1 Private Equity Fund in their private sale of over 14 million shares of common stock of Acushnet to 
Magnus Holdings Co. Ltd., an affiliate of Fila Korea Ltd.  
The Firm's representation of the Korean funds takes place five years after the Firm represented Mirae Asset Global Investments 
and Fila Korea in their 2011 acquisition of Acushnet from its then parent, Fortune Brands. All of the Korean funds’ holdings of 
Acushnet common stock, including the common stock sold in the IPO and to Fila Korea, were converted from convertible 
preferred stock and convertible notes issued by Acushnet and structured by McDermott in the 2011 acquisition. 
McDermott's team was led by Seoul office head and New York Corporate Advisory partner Paul J. Kim and included 
partners Gary Emmanuel of our New York office, Heidi Steele of our Chicago office, as well as Jaeho Lee of our Seoul 
office. 
The deal was recognized by the International Financial Law Review (IFLR) and shortlisted for "Equity Deal of the Year" as part 
of the IFLR 2017 America Awards.   
MCDERMOTT FILES US SUPREME COURT AMICUS BRIEF ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION 
REGARDING SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS 
McDermott represented the American Bar Association (ABA), by filing an amicus curiae brief in the US Supreme Court in Jae 
Lee v. United States, urging the court to reverse the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in a case regarding the scope of 
Sixth Amendment protections for immigrant defendants in criminal cases. Jae Lee v. United States is an appeal of a Sixth Circuit 
ruling that a long-time legal permanent resident and businessman who pled guilty to a first-time drug offense should be 
deported, even though his lawyer incorrectly assured him that his guilty plea would not lead to his deportation.   
Mr. Lee emigrated from South Korea with his family in 1982, as a 13-year-old boy, and has lived legally in the United States for 
decades.  In 2009, the successful restaurateur was charged with possession of ecstasy with intent to distribute.  Based on his 
lawyer’s assurances that his years living legally in the United States, his strong familial and business ties to this country, and his 
lack of a criminal history made it “impossible” for him to be deported, Mr. Lee pleaded guilty.   
When Mr. Lee learned that his lawyer was wrong, he sought to vacate his conviction, claiming ineffective assistance of 
counsel.  However, a federal judge in Tennessee concluded there was no prejudice, because a decision to proceed to trial 
would have almost certainly resulted in a guilty verdict, a longer prison sentence, and deportation.  The Sixth Circuit 
affirmed.  The federal courts of appeal have disagreed about whether such defendants who receive bad legal advice and plead 
guilty -- not knowing that their pleas will lead to deportation -- are prejudiced by such ineffective assistance of counsel, when 
there is strong evidence of guilt.  
The ABA brief cites, among other authorities, the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice with respect to a lawyer’s duty to provide 
competent representation – including the duty to advise a non-citizen defendant about immigration consequences during plea 
negotiations.  The brief argues that a defendant who is deprived of competent legal advice about whether a conviction carries a 
risk of deportation can be prejudiced, notwithstanding the evidence of guilt, because he cannot make a voluntary and informed

decision about whether or not to accept a plea offer and because he is deprived of the ability to negotiate a more favorable plea 
agreement in the first place. 
 
The amicus brief was written by McDermott partners A. Marisa Chun of our Silicon Valley office and Paul M. Thompson of our 
Washington D.C. office and associates Erika N. Pont and Matthew M. Girgenti, with assistance from McDermott Senior Counsel 
and University of California Hastings law professor Rory K. Little. 
CJ CHEILJEDANG CORPORATION 
McDermott represented CJ CheilJedang Corporation of Korea and its Indonesian and US subsidiaries, PT. CheilJedang 
Indonesia and CJ America, Inc. in the First Annual Antidumping Administrative Review before the US Department of Commerce 
in the case on Monosodium Glutamate from Indonesia.  The AD review, which just concluded, resulted in a finding of no (zero) 
dumping by CJ, which allows CJ to obtain a refund of AD cash deposits posted with US Customs on all imports covered by the 
review, and its US imports going forward will now require zero cash deposits.     
Partners David Levine and Raymond Paretzky of our Washington D.C. office represented CJ in this matter. 
YELLOMOBILE INC. 
McDermott represented Yellomobile Inc. in the closings of its convertible bond financings in the aggregate principal amount of 
nearly $100 million. The convertible bond financings were led by various overseas investors.   
 
Yellomobile is a rapidly growing mobile lifestyle solutions provider primarily based in Korea that has grown to be one of Asia’s 
leading mobile media groups with over 25 million monthly service users. It has interests in 70 Internet and mobile companies in 
Korea and Southeast Asia. 
 
The legal team of Yellomobile was shortlisted by the Korea Law Awards 2016 for Technology, Media and Telecommunications 
In-House Team of the Year and Korea In-House Lawyer of the Year.  
 
McDermott's team was led by Seoul office head and New York Corporate Advisory partner Paul J. Kim.   
RECENT RECOGNITIONS  
The Seoul office was recently recognized by Chambers Global 2017 as one of the leading firms for Corporate/M&A: International

The Impact of CFIUS Reviews on M&A Transactions 
David Levine (Washington, DC), Raymond Paretzky (Washington, DC), Sherry Liu (Washington, DC) 
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which is comprised of members from the Departments of 
Treasury (chair), Homeland Security, State, Defence, Justice, Commerce and Energy, was established by executive order in 
1975 to monitor foreign investment. Under current legislation (50 USC App. 2170), CFIUS reviews mergers, acquisitions or 
takeovers that may pose a risk to US national security by foreign control of an entity engaged in US interstate commerce.   
Transactional parties should evaluate the benefits of voluntarily notifying CFIUS in advance of completing any "covered 
transactions."  While doing so may generate additional costs and might delay closing, failing to obtain prior CFIUS approval may 
require a deal to be restructured or even unwound. In addition, with only a few exceptions, once a transaction passes CFIUS 
review it may not be reinvestigated.  Relative to an entire transaction's costs, the time and legal fees associated with voluntary 
review are a small and important investment.  It is therefore no surprise that there has been a noticeable increase in the number 
of deals voluntarily submitted for CFIUS review – from 65 in 2009 to 147 in 2014, the last year covered by a CFIUS annual 
report to Congress.  
THE CFIUS PROCESS 
A CFIUS review may be initiated through a voluntary written notice jointly filed by the transactional parties or directly by CFIUS 
at any point during the transaction, even post-closing. The CFIUS review process has a strict timetable, beginning with a 30 day 
review followed, if necessary, by a 45 day investigation and 15 day US Presidential review.   
CFIUS examines factors pertaining to US national defence; US technological leadership; US critical infrastructure, resources 
and technologies; control of the foreign acquirer by a foreign government; and adherence by the acquirer to US export control 
requirements. CFIUS considers these factors in light of the parties’ government contracts, cyber security practices, supply chain 
features, and the proximity of business operations and property to US government facilities.  
“Critical infrastructures and resources” include vital systems and assets, physical or virtual, the incapacity or destruction of 
which would have a debilitating impact on national physical or economic security, and/or public health or safety. “Critical 
technologies” may include either defence or other export-controlled technology.  CFIUS may examine whether or not the US 
target has classified contracts with the US government, or technology that is subject to export controls or needed for national 
defence.   
Parties filing a voluntary notice are well advised to allow for adequate pre-notice time and to prepare the notice at the same time 
as drafting transactional agreements and conducting due diligence. They should establish responsibilities among personnel and 
agree on the process for preparing the notice and for dealing with CFIUS. Parties should also agree whether or not to include 
deal terms contingent on the outcome of the CFIUS review.   
It is important for parties to engage in a dialogue with CFIUS prior to filing the materials needed for the review, since the 30-
day review clock starts ticking only after CFIUS staff determines that the joint notice is sufficient. Parties should initiate an 
informal discussion with CFIUS staff and work cooperatively with them to ensure the notice is complete and to address all of 
CFIUS’ questions.   
If, at the end of the 30-day review, all CFIUS members conclude that the transaction poses no threat to US national security, 
CFIUS notifies the parties that it does not intend to take further action and the deal is cleared.  Alternatively, CFIUS may begin a 
45 day investigation, at the conclusion of which, if CFIUS finds that the transaction is not a national security threat, the transaction 
is cleared. If CFIUS concludes that the transaction does threaten national security, it may ask the parties to restructure the 
transaction to mitigate the threat or, in rare cases, may recommend to the President of the United States that the transaction be 
prohibited or suspended.

CFIUS TRENDS 
The CFIUS process has been criticized for its complicated nature, amorphous definitions and lack of transparency. Regardless of 
the criticism, CFIUS-reviewed transactions have increased dramatically in recent years, from 65 CFIUS notices, 25 
investigations and two notice withdrawals in 2009, to 147 CFIUS reviews, 51 investigations and nine notice withdrawals in 
2014. It is unclear whether the increase in CFIUS reviews merely correlates with an increase in cross-border transactions 
(from 900 foreign acquisitions of US targets in 2009 to 6,000 in 2014), or whether it reflects a unique rise in CFIUS-based 
concerns, i.e., national security.  Under either scenario, reported trends may help in deciding whether or not to seek review.   
From 2012 to 2014, China accounted for the most CFIUS notices filed and reviewed (19 percent), followed by the United 
Kingdom (13 percent), Canada (11 percent) and Japan (10 percent).  From 2009 to 2014, CFIUS notices primarily came from 
the following sectors: manufacturing (41 percent); finance, information and services (FIS) (32 percent); mining, utilities and 
construction (MUC) (19 percent); and wholesale, retail and transportation (WRT) (8 percent). 
From 2012 to 2014, Chinese, UK and Japanese acquirers generally reflected these sector averages, while Canadian acquirers 
concentrated on the MUC and WRT sectors; French, German, Israeli and Swiss acquirers on the manufacturing sector; and 
Australian, German, Dutch and South Korean acquirers on the FIS sector.  From 2009 to 2014, the number of CFIUS notices 
proceeding to investigations has consistently ranged from roughly 35 percent to 40 percent.   
 
The following is a subsector breakdown of CFIUS activity in 2014.  
 
Manufacturing: The computer and electronic products (42 per cent), machinery (13 per cent), transport equipment (13 per 
cent) and chemical (10 per cent) subsectors yielded the most CFIUS notices. 
FIS: The professional, scientific, and technical (37 per cent), publishing (24 per cent) and real estate (11 per cent) 
subsectors produced the most CFIUS notices. Publishing industries experienced the greatest growth from 2013 to 2014 (18 
per cent), with software publishing representing a significant number of covered transactions.   
MUC: The utilities (52 per cent), oil and gas extraction (20 per cent), and mining (12 per cent) subsectors yielded the most 
notices, with oil and gas extraction experiencing the most growth in the period 2012 to 2014 (5 per cent). 
WRT: Support activities for transportation (53 per cent) and merchant wholesalers for nondurable goods (20 per cent) 
generated the most CFIUS notices. Support activities for transportation and merchant wholesalers for nondurable goods 
experienced consistent growth from 2011 to 2014 (7 per cent and 9 per cent respectively), while merchant wholesalers for 
durable goods experienced a significant decrease (from 22 per cent to 0 per cent). 
CFIUS treats all the material it reviews as confidential and does not publish transaction-specific information.  The information 
released by transaction parties and news reports does, however, help illustrate some key factors considered by CFIUS that 
have resulted in deal terminations or mitigations.   
These include consideration of whether or not an acquisition of a US fibre optic network posed a risk to the security of US data 
transmission and increased the possibility of foreign wiretaps; an acquisition of an oil company could impact US energy supplies; 
a foreign acquirer was associated with its country's military; US property proposed for acquisition was located close to sensitive 
US military installation; and, recently, whether or not the acquisition of mobile data software applications posed risks of 
breaches of date privacy. 
In light of the uncertainty and scheduling issues posed by the CFIUS process, parties to foreign acquisitions of US businesses 
should plan early to collaborate and to prepare for possible CFIUS review.

Coordinating the Effective Date of Mergers in a Global-Post Acquisition Integration  
John Huang (Shanghai), Tom Conaghan (Washington, DC), Andreas Kurtze (Frankfurt), Nicolas Lafont (Paris), Giovanni 
Nicchiniello (Milan), Roy Zhu (Shanghai), Paolo Cocchini (Milan), Anna Steudner (Frankfurt), Calum Thom (London), Joe 
Williams (Washington, DC) 
Negotiating a business combination with a large global competitor is a complicated process, and the complications do not 
necessarily end at the closing of the deal. 
The primary focus of post-acquisition integration projects is to eliminate redundant legal and operational structures. 
Duplicated legal entities mean duplicate costs, including taxation, human resources and the basic operational and legal 
costs of maintaining the separate entities. Redundant legal entities can also lead to market confusion.   
The other main area of concern is the coordination of the timing of the business combination to ensure the following being in 
place the day the merger comes into effect: 
 
> The two companies should be ready, from an operational perspective, to start acting like a single company, e.g., pitching 
for work and processing payroll. 
 > Supplier and customer contracts from the redundant entity transferred to the surviving acquirer entity. 
 > The licenses and regulatory approvals needed to affect the transfer of the redundant entity’s business to the surviving 
acquirer entity. 
   > The legal transfer of employees and employment insurance. 
The company will also prefer to have the legal effective date of the merger coincide with the effective date of the merger from a 
tax and accounting perspective 
 
THE GLOBAL PICTURE 
In the United States, the primary means for eliminating a redundant target legal entity is to merge it out of existence. US 
merger law is very accommodating and flexible, which results in a clean transfer of the assets and liabilities of the redundant 
entity into the acquirer's legal structure. These mergers can often be structured as tax-free reorganisations under the US 
federal income tax law. Timing is also very manageable in the United States, as most states permit mergers to be effected 
within a single day.   
Many global companies discover that, in other jurisdictions, however, it is not possible to achieve these objectives when 
combining redundant and surviving entities through mergers or similar transactions. 
 
In many countries, including Austria, China, Finland, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, the “legal” effective date of the 
merger is tied to the date the merger is officially “registered” in the local commercial registry, which relies to a large extent on 
the actions (or inactions) of certain commercial courts and regulators. In practice, in certain countries (including Austria, 
Finland, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland) the company’s “preferred” legal effective date may be requested, and is ordinarily 
respected by the commercial registry.   
 
In Italy, provided that the merger is by acquisition (a company merging with and into another existing company, with all assets 
and liabilities transferring to the surviving company), the effective date can be postponed until the date on which the deed of 
merger has been filed with the competent local commercial registry. The Italian Civil Code provides simplified rules for 
mergers of a company that is fully owned by the absorbing entity, which can help to eliminate redundant entities.  
 
 In China, however, the legal effective date of the merger is the date determined by the local commercial registry, e.g., 
Shanghai or Beijing, which has complete discretion. For this reason, many business combinations  in China that start as legal 
“mergers” often end as a transfer of assets and liabilities, given the greater flexibility in determining the effective timing.   
  
 
 
Korea Newsletter | 2017 VOLUME 1    7 
KOREA NEWSLETTER 
 
Not all jurisdictions provide for statutory mergers. For example, in the United Kingdom, the process of combining the 
operations of a redundant legal entity after a business combination is more often accomplished through a transfer of assets 
and liabilities, followed by the liquidation of the redundant entity. Although France does provide for a statutory merger, many 
companies often choose to follow the transmission universelle de patrimoine (TUP) process, instead of a merger.  The TUP 
process allows for a relatively expedited and straightforward transfer of assets and liabilities and the liquidation of the 
redundant entity.  
COORDINATING LEGAL EFFECTIVENESS WITH ACCOUNTING EFFECTIVENESS 
Some jurisdictions do differentiate between "legal" and "accounting" effectiveness, raising planning issue that companies should 
discuss with their auditors.   
 
Certain countries, such as Germany and Spain, require the merging companies to submit financial statements alongside a 
request for merger approval. In Germany, the “accounting effective date” of the merger will be the closing date of the balance 
sheet of the redundant entity filed with the commercial register, which will precede the legal effective date. In Spain, the 
“accounting effective date” will be the first day of the fiscal year in which the merger was approved.

Cross-Border Direct Investing 
Mark Selinger (New York) 
As the mid-market private company transaction market heats up, family office investors will find themselves competing for 
deals with strategic acquirers and private equity funds, not to mention independent sponsors and other family office investors 
who have entered the market in recent years.  This may compel some of the most sophisticated investors to look abroad for 
investment opportunities. Investing abroad is not, however, for the weak of heart. While unusual opportunities may indeed be 
available, at attractive valuations, conducting the due diligence and implementing and operating those opportunities present 
unique and, for some, unsurmountable challenges. There are those investors who say that cultural considerations are overrated 
and that in the increasingly flat, inter-connected world we live in, analysing a cross-border transaction is no different than a 
domestic transaction. This may be the case, as far as financial models are concerned, but an Excel spreadsheet cannot tell 
you how your actions will be perceived in a different culture. 
BE PRESENT 
Family office investors may have an advantage over strategic acquirers and investment funds in cross-border mid- 
market deals.  Many target companies will themselves be family-controlled businesses, and may take comfort from a 
transaction with another family-controlled entity, as opposed to an institutional acquirer; private equity funds, in 
particular, have a bit of a bad name in Europe these days. 
 
To capitalise on this advantage, a family office investor must make it clear that it is different from an institutional investor, in 
particular by connecting not just with the seller, but with senior management, employees and other constituencies, such as 
local government officials.  A willingness to meet in the target’s home jurisdiction and to spend time there (rather than just 
flying in and out), helps establish credibility.  After the transaction is closed, some senior managers may secretly want the 
new owners to stay far away from the company, but seasoned investors know that a portfolio company investment cannot 
be managed entirely from afar. 
 
In many countries, a business enterprise is expected to reflect the owner’s values, and ultimately this can’t be accomplished if 
the owner is hidden from view or poorly represented by a local partner or senior management.  This may require some family 
investors, who cherish their privacy and prefer to remain in the background, to leave their comfort zone, because what would 
be considered a mid-market deal in the United States is often a very big deal in a non-US jurisdiction; you can expect local 
newspaper articles, TV and radio coverage and other unwanted attention. Also, in some cultures, particularly if the investment 
is in a strategic or culturally significant industry, a foreign investor can be seen as foreign interloper, or worse. All the more 
reason, therefore, to establish personal credibility and maintain a strong local presence. 
CHOOSE A LOCAL PARTNER YOU CAN TRUST 
Whether it is someone who is familiar with the company, a local attorney, accountant, business advisor or co-investor, having a 
local presence who is both respected by the portfolio company and trusted by you is a major asset for a successful 
investment. 
KNOW YOUR MANAGEMENT 
Even with a local presence, there is nothing that will cause a cross-border investment to succeed or fail so much as the quality 
of the management team.  You must be confident that the management team shares your family office’s values, philosophy 
and vision, because it will be the management who will be entrusted with implementing your strategy and presenting your 
public face. Without a trusting relationship, complemented with regular visits and communication, the foreign investor may be 
seen as a distant, somewhat malign force. This perception can quickly spread through the company and poison the 
relationship between you and your management. 
 
Cross border direct investing can be an exhilarating and profitable experience, but it must be entered into knowledgably, with

experienced advisors and partners.  As direct investing becomes an increasingly common part of many family office portfolios, 
cross-border direct investing will no doubt become an active, and competitive, investment area in the years to come.

The Rising Popularity of M&A Transactions in the Life Sciences Sector 
Emmanuelle Trombe (Paris), Rachel Monjou (Paris) 
Botox and Viagra would have made a perfect match, but the US Treasury stepped in to tighten up US tax laws and put a 
hold on what was expected to be the largest M&A deal in the history of life sciences and also the biggest tax “inversion” 
ever attempted.  This cancelled merger brought life sciences M&A into the limelight, but this was well-deserved, as 2015 
was a prolific year for the sector. While 2015 was characterized by a large number of M&A deals across all industries, the 
life sciences sector had the largest share. 
WHY IS M&A SO POPULAR 
There are a number of reasons why, when compared with other heavily-regulated and research-oriented sectors such as oil, 
gas or automotive, so many M&A dea ls  have recently occurred in the life sciences sector.  The most obvious reason is the 
“patent cliff”. The number of very profitable, blockbuster pharmaceutical products is diminishing as a result of key patents 
reaching their expiration date, which leads to decreased profits resulting from the entry into the market of generics, that new 
medicines often target narrower segments of population, meaning their potential market is relatively small. As a result, even if the 
R&D stage is successful, it is uncertain how profitable these new medicines will be. As a result, when pharmaceutical 
companies find it difficult to innovate, or lack the resources to fund R&D, they buy products that are at a less risky stage.  The 
sellers are often smaller companies that have specific expertise in R&D, but have no late stage development or 
commercialization expertise, or do not have the financial capability to fund it. 
TYPES OF DEALS 
Two specific types of M&A transaction have seen an increase in recent years: the selective acquisition of strategic 
businesses and the divestiture of non-core businesses. A number of these transactions have been implemented 
through asset swaps.   
This trend is illustrated by GlaxoSmithKline’s swap of oncology assets in exchange for Novartis’ vaccine division 
and Sanofi’s contemplated trading of Merial, its animal-health unit, for Boehringer’s consumer health care business.  
These asset swaps often create opportunities for other transactions, for example, when divestitures are required as 
a clearance condition by antitrust authorities.  As part of its transaction with GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis had to divest 
two of its late development stage immune-oncology products, Encorafenib and Binimetinib, to Array 
Pharmaceuticals, which in turn entered into an agreement for the development and commercialisation of these 
products in Europe with Pierre Fabre.   
In order to refocus on their core businesses, pharmaceutical companies have also tended to outsource manufacturing 
and even, to some extent, early R&D, and to divest non-core programmes into spin-out companies, which may be 
financed by investors.  These trends multiply opportunities for M&A and other type of transactions.   
LICENSING AND COLLABORATION 
By far the most popular transactions in life sciences, however, are still licensing and collaboration; 65 per cent of externally 
sourced pipeline value comes from co-development, joint ventures and licensing, while only 35 per cent from “pure” M&A.   
 
The number of licensing and collaboration deals has dramatically increased for the same reasons as M&A deals: the patent cliff 
and risk sharing. Unlike M&A, collaboration and licensing transactions often allow the pharmaceutical company to retain the 
benefit of its partner’s expertise and the ability to innovate fast. They also allow pharmaceutical companies to access expertise 
outside their core business, whether in biotechnology, medical devices or digital health, which is perceived as a key area of 
growth. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
Korea Newsletter | 2017 VOLUME 1    11 
KOREA NEWSLETTER 
PRICE STRUCTURES 
The price structure of M&A and licensing deals tends to converge in life sciences since earn-out clauses are quite common 
in M&A transactions.  In an earn-out structure, the ultimate price is based on the performance of the target or its assets 
following the closing.  In life sciences, the earn-out triggers are often linked to the development or the commercialization of the 
acquired products. This mechanism is intended to bridge the valuation gap between the value expected by the seller and the 
price that the buyer is willing to pay at any given stage of the life cycle of the product.  This alignment is of the utmost 
importance considering the intrinsic uncertainty of R&D, coupled with the heavy regulatory and market access constraints, 
which make it difficult for the buyer to pay full price until the acquired assets are de-risked. It is therefore not surprising that 
more than 50 per cent of life sciences M&A deals contain earn-out provisions. This mechanism is used both in private M&A 
and in public M&A, in the form of contingent value rights.   
 
Since the achievement of earn-out -triggering events depends on the management of the acquired business by the buyer, 
there is a risk of litigation when the buyer fails to meet the targeted performance. In most cases, the share purchase 
agreement states the anticipated level of diligence that is expected from the buyer in pursuing the triggering events. In life 
sciences, however, there are so many uncertainties out of the parties’ reasonable control that it is difficult to request firm 
commitments from the buyer.   
 
The compromise is often to agree on a very qualified definition of “commercially reasonable efforts” or “diligent efforts”.  This 
must take into account the level of effort and resources consistent with those used by the buyer or a similar company, for a 
similar product, with a similar market potential, at a similar stage in its development or product life, balanced against a 
number of factors, such as market exclusivity, competitiveness of alternate products, profitability and, sometimes, 
provisions referring to all other relevant factors. 
  
These earn-out systems are very likely to lead to disputes as a result of their complexity and the amounts usually at stake. 
When disputes occur, it is often difficult to determine the damages suffered by the seller. In licensing agreements, one of 
the remedies for the licensee’s breach of its obligation to diligently develop and commercialize the licensed product could 
be that the license is terminated and the licensor obtains the product back along with all improvements generated by the 
licensee, so that it is able to exploit the product itself or to find a better partner. This reversion is more difficult to implement 
in an M&A context, where the sellers may not be willing, or have the capacity, to take the assets back. 
 
In conclusion, despite a strong convergence between M&A and licensing, with more and more back-end-loaded M&A 
transactions, licensing and collaboration remain the preferred methods for life sciences companies to expand their product 
portfolios.

Rewarding Long-Term Shareholders: European and U.S. Loyalty Share Programs 
Tom Conaghan (Washington, DC), Lionel Lesur (Paris), Lindsey Reighard (Dallas), Louis Leroy (Paris) 
“Long-term oriented shareholders, who hold on to their shares during the difficult but critical time the company is facing will thus 
be rewarded.” This is how the CEO of the tire manufacturer Michelin explained the motivation behind the issuance of loyalty 
shares (commonly referred to as L-shares) in the form of a warrant by his company in 1991. Loyalty shares, or shares that 
provide a reward to shareholders (typically in the form of additional shares or dividends) if they hold their shares for a certain 
period of time, and other similar loyalty share programs have become increasingly popular in European countries as a way to 
incentivize long-term shareholding and are slowly making their way into the United States. 
LOYALTY SHARE PROGRAMS IN EUROPE 
Rewarding long-term shareholding is no novelty in Europe, where it has been subject to regulation by the European Union since 
the financial crisis of 2007. The European Parliament passed Directive 2007/36/EC to regulate the exercise of certain rights of 
shareholders in listed companies, and amended the Directive on July 8, 2015.  However, these pieces of legislation provide a 
limited framework for encouraging a higher level of monitoring and engagement by institutional investors and asset managers, 
and instead leave these issues in the hands of the individual EU Member States. 
 
The French legal system offers several mechanisms to support long-term shareholding, the latest being implemented on March 
29, 2014 with the adoption of the so-called “Loi Florange”. French listed companies must automatically grant double voting rights 
to shareholders who hold their shares in registered form for at least 2 years (Art. L.225-123§3 of the French Commercial Code), 
and non-listed companies may grant double voting rights to their shareholders who hold their shares in registered form for the 
same period (Art. L.225-123§1 of the French Commercial Code). Listed and non-listed French companies may also issue L-
warrants (Art. L.228-91 et seq. of the French Commercial Code) to certain shareholders, or grant loyalty dividends (an additional 
dividend) under certain conditions (Art. L.232-14 of the French Commercial Code). These loyalty schemes have been 
implemented by many major French listed companies, such as L’Oréal, Electricité de France and Crédit Agricole (loyalty 
dividend), or Vivendi, Engie, and Air France KLM (double voting rights). 
 
Other European countries have adopted similar mechanisms. The Netherlands permits companies to grant multiple voting rights 
to certain categories of shareholders, provided that such companies register their shares in a “Loyalty Register”.  This scheme 
was notably used by Ferrari NV in its IPO and by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV upon completion of the cross-border reverse 
merger by Chrysler-Fiat with and into Fiat Investments NV in 2014. In Italy, a Legislative Decree of January 27, 2010 allowed 
listed companies to pay increased dividends to shareholders that hold common shares for a certain period (at least one year). In 
August 2014, a reform authorized both listed and non-listed Italian companies to issue shares with multiple voting rights. These 
rewarding schemes have been a success, and a number of Italian companies, including in particular Campari and Amplifon, 
have awarded loyalty shares to certain categories of shareholders. 
LOYALTY SHARE PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES 
Despite the popularity of programs in Europe designed to reward long-term shareholders, U.S. companies have been slow to 
implement these types of programs.  The U.S. stock market is generally characterized by “short-termism,” a focus on short-term 
results at the expense of long-term performance, driven in part by the need to report quarterly earnings. U.S. shareholders, 
many of which are institutional investors, tend to hold their shares for a short period of time.  According to the 2016 NYSE Group 
turnover statistics, the annualized turnover for shares listed and traded on the NYSE at the end of 2016 was 70%, indicating that 
a majority of shareholders held their shares for less than one year.  
 
A common example of short-termism in the United States is short selling. Generally, a short sale is the sale of a security by a 
seller that does not own the security.  The seller typically borrows the security that it has sold for delivery to the buyer with the 
expectation that the seller can buy back the same security at a later date for a lower price and turn a profit.  A “naked” short sale 
occurs when the seller does not borrow the security in time to deliver it to the buyer within the standard three-day settlement 
  
 
 
Korea Newsletter | 2017 VOLUME 1    13 
KOREA NEWSLETTER 
period.  Naked short selling, which can send misleading signals to the market and decrease share prices, came under intensified 
scrutiny in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis following speculation that it had contributed to the collapse of certain U.S. 
financial firms.   
 
Facing the rising backlash among companies against short sellers, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has 
taken a variety of regulatory, enforcement and emergency actions to address concerns regarding failures of delivery and 
abusive naked short selling, including amendments to Regulation SHO and Regulation M.  
 
The SEC attempted to promote long-term shareholding by proposing a rule that would have provided shareholders who held a 
significant amount of company stock for at least 3 years the right to include in the company’s proxy statement their own director 
nominees.  The rule was ultimately invalidated by the U.S. courts, but that did not stop many companies from voluntarily (or in 
response to demands from shareholder activists) their own proxy access bylaws.  Proxy access provisions can now be found in 
the bylaws of a majority of the Fortune 500, and, generally, they also require at least 3 years ownership in order to be eligible to 
nominate director candidates for inclusion in the company’s proxy statement. However, unlike its European counterparts, the 
SEC has yet to adopt mechanisms expressly permitting loyalty shares, voting rights and dividends.   
 
Given the lack of regulatory framework to guide companies when implementing loyalty share programs, it is not surprising that 
these types of programs remain a novelty in the United States.  Nonetheless, some U.S. companies have ventured into these 
relatively uncharted waters.  For example, The J.M. Smucker Company has adopted “time phased voting,” allowing each share 
that has been held for more than four years to have 10 votes per share (instead of one vote) on certain matters, and NexPoint 
Credit Strategies Fund has offered or offers a 2% match through NexPoint Advisors, L.P., its investment advisor, to 
shareholders that buy and hold the fund’s common shares for at least one year.  Other companies have offered warrants to 
purchase shares that are exercisable at a certain period of time in the future, like Check-Cap Ltd., an Israeli company, that 
issued warrants to its U.S. IPO purchasers in 2015 that permitted such purchasers to acquire common shares at a fixed 
purchase price if they held their IPO shares for a minimum of 1-2 years.  
REGISTRATION OF LOYALTY SHARES 
If a company decides to pursue a loyalty share program for U.S. shareholders, it should consider whether the loyalty share 
program constitutes a “sale” or an “offer to sell” a security that requires registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as 
amended (the “Securities Act”).  Section 2(a)(3) of the Securities Act defines a “sale” as a “…disposition of a security or interest 
in a security, for value.” (emphasis added)  As a result, a “typical” dividend does not require registration because it is not given 
“for value.”  Additionally, in the context of a corporate “spin off” transaction, the SEC Staff has stated that a parent spinning off 
the shares of its subsidiary to its shareholders does not have to register those spun off subsidiary shares under the Securities 
Act as a sale as long as certain conditions are met, including the condition that the spin off must be pro rata to the parent’s 
shareholders (SEC Staff Legal Bulletin 4 (1997)).  This condition is important because, as the SEC Staff stated, “[i]f a spin-off is 
not pro rata, the shareholders’ relative interests change and some shareholders give up value for the spun off shares.”   
 
Depending on the relevant facts and circumstances, the distribution of loyalty shares might therefore be characterized as a 
“sale” of securities that requires registration.  The SEC might view a loyalty share as being more similar to a “right” issued in a 
rights offering, in that the holder can elect to exercise that right by foregoing the legal right to transfer its underlying shares, 
thereby accepting investment risk in exchange for receiving the loyalty share.  Even though there is no exercise price for a 
loyalty share (as you would see in a typical rights offering or with a warrant), there could be “value” flowing back to the company 
in the form of loyalty, lack of volatility and other indirect benefits that long-term shareholders provide to the company.  The SEC 
might also take a “remedy-based” approach, by stating that the holder who chose to “register” his “intent” to be loyal is really 
making an investment decision, and, if he is damaged for holding the underlying shares (i.e., the share price drops while he is 
trying to make it to the loyalty date), he should be entitled to receive, as damages, the “consideration” he “paid” for registering 
into the loyalty share program.

Given the novel and unique structure of loyalty share programs in the United States and the lack of precedent or specific support 
for loyalty shares without registration, companies would be prudent to either register such shares or, at a minimum, seek no-
action relief from the SEC. 
 
FIDUCIARY DUTIES 
When approving a loyalty share program, directors of a company should be careful to ensure that they comply with their 
fiduciary duties to the company and its shareholders. Directors of Delaware corporations are generally protected by the business 
judgement rule and the presumption that the board acted in the best interest of the corporation; however, one of the situations in 
which this presumption may be rebutted, thereby shifting the burden to the directors to show the entire fairness of the 
transaction, is when self-dealing is present. A classic example of self-dealing is non pro-rata distributions, where a majority 
shareholder receives a dividend that is not paid to minority shareholders.  Depending on the structure of the loyalty share 
program and the ownership of the corporation, issuing loyalty shares or additional votes to shareholders who have held their 
shares for a longer period of time (which in many cases may be majority shareholders) could subject directors to breach of 
fiduciary duty claims.   
STEPS FORWARD 
The article highlights only a few of the issues that a company should consider before implementing a loyalty share program for 
U.S. shareholders.  Because of the lack of regulatory guidance in the United States (unlike in Europe), companies should tread 
carefully if they decide to proceed with such a program in the United States.

Preqin Solutions









About Us









Preqin Solutions, formerly Baxon Solutions, is the leading innovator of cloud solutions to the Private Equity industry. We believe that the Private Equity industry deserves better software to help it manage data, and our firm aims to deliver simple functionality to enhance the quality of data and decision making tools available to portfolio companies through to the asset owners. Central to this objective, is the belief that these tools should be accessible to all market participants, and we aim to accommodate all firm sizes through a scalable pricing model and a lightweight solution that doesn’t require significant client resource to manage.
Established in 2005, we have built an extensive in-house team of experienced consultants and financial analysts and accumulated a wealth of client and implementation best practices from our global customer base. We provide a consultative approach to fully assess your business challenges to configure our solution to your needs.
Preqin Solutions is a subsidiary of Preqin Limited, the leading source of information for the alternative assets industry, providing data and analysis via online databases, publications and bespoke data requests. Preqin’s products and services are utilized by more than 47,000 professionals located in over 90 countries for a range of activities including investor relations, fundraising and marketing, and market research. Founded in 2003, the company operates from offices in London, Singapore, New York, Austin, San Francisco, Buenos Aires, Hong Kong and Manila.
Why Preqin Solutions
We are wholly focused on supporting and enhancing the portfolio management process, allowing integration with legacy and best of breed (BOB) systems. Our solution offers consistency and complete transparency in line with private equity directives such as AIFMD and Form PF and private equity industry alliances such as Altexchange and InvestEurope.
Our cloud solution offers significant time savings through automating manual processes and has proven to reduce the entire reporting process by over 45%.
No new hardware, software or IT support is required and the implementation period is 8-12 weeks, by far the fastest in the industry. Most users require less than an hour of training.
We believe that the future relies on an agnostic web interface. It is not a file-based system relying on an Excel add-in. For those who choose to, it can also interface with Excel however.
Finally, through the integration of Preqin data we have the unique ability to contextualize your fund performance relative to public and private markets. More than just the data comes the insight through having access to the expectations of over 10,000 market participants given Preqin’s global presence

Investments/Insurance: Not FDIC Insured • Not Bank Issued, Guaranteed or Underwritten • May Lose Value



Morningstar® is an independent service that rates mutual funds and other types of investments. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.



Automatic investment plans don't assure a profit or protect against loss in declining markets.



Asset allocation funds may change portfolio holding allocations on a frequent basis, resulting in high portfolio turnover and more brokerage commissions from an increased amount of the purchasing and selling of securities. The Fund may have a higher proportion of capital gains and a potentially lower return than a fund that does not have a reallocation policy.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
