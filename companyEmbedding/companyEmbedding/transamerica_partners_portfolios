Transamerica Partners Government Money Market Schedule of Daily Information











                                                    Transamerica Partners Money Market changed its name to Transamerica Partners Government Money Market, 
                                                    and Transamerica Partners Institutional Money Market changed its name to Transamerica 
                                                    Partners Institutional Government Money Market, and each fund now operates as a “government” 
                                                    money market fund under new federal regulations, which became effective on October 14, 2016. 
                                                    A “government” money market fund invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in U.S. government 
                                                    securities, cash, and/or repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by U.S. government 
                                                    securities or cash.  You could lose money by investing in the Fund. Although the Fund seeks 
                                                    to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. 
                                                    The Fund may impose a fee upon sale of your shares or may temporarily suspend your ability to sell 
                                                    shares if  the Fund's liquidity falls below required minimums because of market conditions or other 
                                                    factors. An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance 
                                                    Corporation or any other government agency. The Fund's sponsor has no legal obligation to provide 
                                                    financial support to the Fund, and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support 
                                                    to the Fund at any time.
                                                   
  
                                                    Transamerica Partners Government Money Market and Transamerica Partners Institutional Government Money Market invest all of their investable assets in the Transamerica Partners Government Money Market Portfolio.

                                                        The performance data presented here represents past performance; past performance is not indicative of future results. 
                                                        Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return 
                                                        and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may
                                                        be worth more or less than the original cost. Prices and returns fluctuate daily.
                                                        


                                                        Performance may not be available for all periods indicated. Returns include reinvestment of dividends
                                                        and capital gains, but do not reflect any sales charges. Fund shares are sold without a sales charge. 
                                                        


                                                        Performance figures may reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements by the Investment Adviser. 
                                                        Without such waivers and/or reimbursements, the performance would be lower. 
                                                        Future waivers and/or reimbursements are at the discretion of the Investment Adviser.
                                                        



                                                    Mutual funds are subject to market risk, including the loss of principal. Past Performance is not indicative

                                                        Shares of the Funds may only be sold by offering the Funds’ Prospectus. You should consider the investment 
                                                        objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the Funds carefully before investing. The Prospectus contains 
                                                        this and additional important information regarding the Funds. The Prospectus should be read carefully before

                                                recordkeeper or authorized financial intermediary.  If you are a participant in a plan, you should obtain the
