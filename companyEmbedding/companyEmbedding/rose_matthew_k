Board of Directors







Randall L. Stephenson
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President




Randall L. Stephenson
Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President
Randall was named to his current position in 2007. Since then, AT&T has invested to become a global leader in the rapidly converging telecommunications, media and technology (TMT) space, providing integrated solutions that range from premium video entertainment, high-speed Internet and mobility to IP network services, security and the Internet of Things (IoT).
Today, AT&T is the largest pay TV provider in the United States and one of the largest in the world. The company offers video entertainment to more than 25 million customers in the United States and almost 20 million customers in Latin America, including SKY México.


In North America, AT&T covers nearly 400 million people with its 4G LTE network and has nearly 147 million wireless subscribers. The company provides high-speed Internet connections to 60 million U.S. customer locations; ultra-fast fiber connections covering nearly 4 million U.S. locations; global IP network services that connect nearly 3.5 million businesses on 6 continents, representing 99% of the world’s economy; and more than 31 million IoT devices and sensors connected to its network.


AT&T is one of the world’s largest companies in TMT, with more than $163 billion in 2016 revenues and 33 consecutive years of dividend growth. Over the past 5 years, AT&T has invested over $140 billion in the United States, including capital investments in wireless and wireline networks and acquisitions of wireless spectrum and operations.


The company has committed $400 million since 2008 to its signature philanthropic initiative, AT&T Aspire, which drives innovation in education to promote student success in school and the workplace. Randall also has led AT&T’s breakthrough “It Can Wait” campaign – an education and awareness program educating drivers that distracted driving is never OK. The program has amassed more than 14 million pledges of support.


Randall began his career with Southwestern Bell Telephone in 1982 in Oklahoma. He served as the company’s senior executive vice president and chief financial officer from 2001 to 2004, and from 2004 to 2007 he served as chief operating officer. He was appointed to AT&T’s board of directors in 2005.


He is a member of the board of directors of Emerson Electric Co. and Boeing, a member of the PGA TOUR Policy Board, and National President of the Boy Scouts of America. Randall received his B.S. in accounting from the University of Central Oklahoma and his Master of Accountancy from the University of Oklahoma.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
