Early life and education[edit]
Feinberg was born to a American Jewish family[3][4] and raised in The Bronx, New York. When aged eight, his family moved to Spring Valley, New York,[5] a suburb of New York City. His father was a steel salesman.[5] He attended Princeton University and graduated with a degree in politics in 1982.[6] While there, he captained the tennis team and joined the Reserve Officer Training Corps.[5]
Professional career[edit]
After graduating from college, Feinberg worked as a trader at Drexel Burnham in 1982 and later at Gruntal & Co..[7]
In 1992, at the age of 32, Feinberg co-founded Cerberus Capital Management with William L. Richter.[7] At the time the firm had $10 million under management; its assets under management have since grown to over $30 billion in 2016.[8][9] In 1999, the firm hired former Vice President Dan Quayle as a Chairman of Cerberus Global Investment.[10] In 2006, the firm hired former United States Secretary of the Treasury John Snow, who serves as a Chairman of Cerberus.[11]
In May 2011, Feinberg stated that he believed residential mortgage-backed securities may present "a real opportunity for continued investment for quite a period of time"[12] and that there were opportunities in buying assets from European banks.
Feinberg has been critical about the pay received by private equity executives, stating, "In general, I think that all of us are way overpaid in this business. It is almost embarrassing."[13] He has also noted in comments made in 2011 that smaller private equity fund sizes may be better for investor returns: "If your goal is to maximize your return as opposed to assets under management, I think you can be most effective with a big company infrastructure and a little bit smaller fund size."[13]
Feinberg has been described as "secretive" in The New York Times.[14] In 2007, Feinberg told Cerberus shareholders, "If anyone at Cerberus has his picture in the paper and a picture of his apartment, we will do more than fire that person. We will kill him. The jail sentence will be worth it."[15]
Through Cerberus, Feinberg also ownes DynCorp, which is a major national security contractor with the U.S. government.[16]
Political involvement[edit]
Feinberg, a major Republican donor,[17] served as one of the top economic advisers to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.[18] He is a member of The Business Council in Washington, DC, an association of chief executive officers from a broad range of companies. [19] In February 2017, the New York Times reported that President Trump will assign Feinberg a role in the White House leading a review of the US intelligence agencies.[20]
Personal[edit]
Feinberg reportedly made $50 million in 2004. His lifestyle is notably less extravagant than his peers in private equity.[21] He splits time between his homes on Manhattan's Upper East Side and Greenwich, Connecticut with his wife Gisela (née Sanchez).[5]

Early life and education[edit]
Feinberg was born to a American Jewish family[3][4] and raised in The Bronx, New York. When aged eight, his family moved to Spring Valley, New York,[5] a suburb of New York City. His father was a steel salesman.[5] He attended Princeton University and graduated with a degree in politics in 1982.[6] While there, he captained the tennis team and joined the Reserve Officer Training Corps.[5]
Professional career[edit]
After graduating from college, Feinberg worked as a trader at Drexel Burnham in 1982 and later at Gruntal & Co..[7]
In 1992, at the age of 32, Feinberg co-founded Cerberus Capital Management with William L. Richter.[7] At the time the firm had $10 million under management; its assets under management have since grown to over $30 billion in 2016.[8][9] In 1999, the firm hired former Vice President Dan Quayle as a Chairman of Cerberus Global Investment.[10] In 2006, the firm hired former United States Secretary of the Treasury John Snow, who serves as a Chairman of Cerberus.[11]
In May 2011, Feinberg stated that he believed residential mortgage-backed securities may present "a real opportunity for continued investment for quite a period of time"[12] and that there were opportunities in buying assets from European banks.
Feinberg has been critical about the pay received by private equity executives, stating, "In general, I think that all of us are way overpaid in this business. It is almost embarrassing."[13] He has also noted in comments made in 2011 that smaller private equity fund sizes may be better for investor returns: "If your goal is to maximize your return as opposed to assets under management, I think you can be most effective with a big company infrastructure and a little bit smaller fund size."[13]
Feinberg has been described as "secretive" in The New York Times.[14] In 2007, Feinberg told Cerberus shareholders, "If anyone at Cerberus has his picture in the paper and a picture of his apartment, we will do more than fire that person. We will kill him. The jail sentence will be worth it."[15]
Through Cerberus, Feinberg also ownes DynCorp, which is a major national security contractor with the U.S. government.[16]
Political involvement[edit]
Feinberg, a major Republican donor,[17] served as one of the top economic advisers to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.[18] He is a member of The Business Council in Washington, DC, an association of chief executive officers from a broad range of companies. [19] In February 2017, the New York Times reported that President Trump will assign Feinberg a role in the White House leading a review of the US intelligence agencies.[20]
Personal[edit]
Feinberg reportedly made $50 million in 2004. His lifestyle is notably less extravagant than his peers in private equity.[21] He splits time between his homes on Manhattan's Upper East Side and Greenwich, Connecticut with his wife Gisela (née Sanchez).[5]
