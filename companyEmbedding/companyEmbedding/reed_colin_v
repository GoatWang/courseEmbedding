Cutters & Cutter Wheels



 






Cutter Wheels
All Reed cutter wheels are made from high shock-resistant tool steel, while competitive cutter wheels are made from carbon steel or still lower quality tool steel.








Cutter Finder
Use Reed’s new Cutter Finder to search for the best Reed Cutter for the job.











Quick Release™ Tubing Cutters
Quick Release Tubing Cutters are the best tracking, easiest cutting tubing cutters available. Cut copper, aluminum, light wall steel, and stainless steel tubing.








Tubing Cutters
Tubing cutters feature a screw feed with a large grip knob to make it easier to tighten the cutter. 








Tubing Cutters for Stainless Steel
Reed tubing cutters are equipped with special wheels for stainless steel.









Telescoping Tubing Cutters
Telescoping Tubing Cutters fit tight spaces as their feed screw keeps them a consistent size throughout the cut.









Mini Tubing Cutters
For use in extremely tight places, mini tubing cutters require minimal swing around the tubing.








C Cutters
Everyone needs a handy cutter like Reed’s C Cutter. This easy-to-grip cutter easily snaps on to copper tubing for a quick, clean cut.

Reed offers a variety of repair kits for tubing cutters.

Hinged Cutters™ feature four wheels to cut steel, stainless steel, cast and ductile iron with only 90° to 110° handle swing.








Hinged Cutters™ with Helper Handles

Utility Workshop Vises
Heavy-duty design strengthens this ideal utility workshop vise.









Mid-Line Vises
