Frank J. FERLITO and Susan Ferlito, individually and as Next Friend for Jennifer Ferlito, Joseph Ferlito and Frank John Ferlito, II, Plaintiffs,
v.
JOHNSON & JOHNSON PRODUCTS, INC., a New Jersey corporation, Defendant.


United States District Court, E.D. Michigan, S.D.
August 22, 1991.








Attorney(s) appearing for the Case
  Gary C. Berger, Milan, Miller, Berger, Brody & Miller, P.C., Detroit, Mich., Kenneth A. Webb, Kenneth A. Webb, P.C., Troy, Mich., for plaintiffs.
Robert S. Krause, Brian K. Cullin, Dickinson, Wright, Moon, VanDusen & Freeman, Detroit, Mich., for defendant.





MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER GRANTING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT
GADOLA, District Judge.
Plaintiffs Susan and Frank Ferlito, husband and wife, attended a Halloween party in 1984 dressed as Mary (Mrs. Ferlito) and her little lamb (Mr. Ferlito). Mrs. Ferlito had constructed a lamb costume for her husband by gluing cotton batting manufactured by defendant Johnson & Johnson Products ("JJP") to a suit of long underwear. She had also used defendant's product to fashion a headpiece, complete with ears. The costume covered Mr. Ferlito from his head to his ankles, except for his face and hands, which were blackened with Halloween paint. At the party Mr. Ferlito attempted to light his cigarette by using a butane lighter. The flame passed close to his left arm, and the cotton batting on his left sleeve ignited. Plaintiffs sued defendant for injuries they suffered from burns which covered approximately one-third of Mr. Ferlito's body.
Following a jury verdict entered for plaintiffs November 2, 1989, the Honorable Ralph M. Freeman entered a judgment for plaintiff Frank Ferlito in the amount of $555,000 and for plaintiff Susan Ferlito in the amount of $70,000. Judgment was entered November 7, 1989.
Subsequently, on November 16, 1989, defendant JJP filed a timely motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b) or, in the alternative, for new trial. Plaintiffs filed their response to defendant's motion December 18, 1989; and defendant filed a reply January 4, 1990. Before reaching a decision on this motion, Judge Freeman died. The case was reassigned to this court April 12, 1990.
After a status conference June 26, 1990, the court ordered defendant to file a complete trial transcript and to file a supplemental brief discussing the applicability of Fed.R.Civ.P. 63. Plaintiffs were given thirty days to respond to defendant's supplemental brief. Both parties filed timely briefs. Oral argument on defendant's motion was heard April 17, 1991. The court, having read the pleadings, heard oral argument and being otherwise familiar in the premises, grants defendant JJP's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
Pursuant to Rule 63 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the court is granted broad discretion in deciding the present motion.
If by reason of death, sickness, or other disability, a judge before whom an action has been tried is unable to perform the duties to be performed by the court under these rules after a verdict is returned or findings of fact and conclusions of law are filed, then any other judge regularly sitting in or assigned to the court in which the action was tried may perform those duties....
Fed.R.Civ.P. 63.
Judge Freeman died before ruling on defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for new trial, after a jury verdict was returned. Rule 63 clearly states that, as the  successor judge, I may perform those duties.
MOTION FOR JUDGMENT NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT
Issuance of a judgment notwithstanding the verdict ("j.n.o.v.") is authorized by Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides in relevant part:
Whenever a motion for a directed verdict made at the close of all the evidence is denied or for any reason is not granted, the court is deemed to have submitted the action to the jury subject to a later determination of the legal questions raised by the motion. Not later than 10 days after entry of judgment, a party who has moved for a directed verdict may move to have the verdict and any judgment entered thereon set aside and to have judgment entered in accordance with the party's motion for a directed verdict.... [A] new trial may be prayed for in the alternative. If a verdict was returned the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment and either order a new trial or direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed.
Rule 50(b) Fed.R.Civ.P.
Defendant JJP filed two motions for a directed verdict, the first on October 27, 1989, at the close of plaintiffs' proofs, and the second on October 30, 1989, at the close of defendant's proofs. Judge Freeman denied both motions without prejudice. Judgment for plaintiffs was entered November 7, 1989; and defendant's instant motion, filed November 16, 1989, was filed in a timely manner.
The standard for determining whether to grant a j.n.o.v. is identical to the standard for evaluating a motion for directed verdict:
In determining whether the evidence is sufficient, the trial court may neither weigh the evidence, pass on the credibility of witnesses nor substitute its judgment for that of the jury. Rather, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made, drawing from that evidence all reasonable inferences in his favor.
Morelock v. NCR Corp., 586 F.2d 1096, 1104 (6th Cir.1978), cert. denied, 441 U.S. 906, 99 S.Ct. 1995, 60 L.Ed.2d 375 (1979). If after reviewing the evidence, however, the trial court is of the opinion that reasonable minds could not come to the result reached by the jury, then the motion for j.n.o.v. should be granted. Toth v. Yoder Co., 749 F.2d 1190, 1194 (6th Cir.1984). The trial court makes its determination as a matter of law. Id.; O'Neill v. Kiledjian, 511 F.2d 511, 513 (6th Cir.1975).
To recover in a "failure to warn" product liability action, a plaintiff must prove each of the following four elements of negligence: (1) that the defendant owed a duty to the plaintiff, (2) that the defendant violated that duty, (3) that the defendant's breach of that duty was a proximate cause of the damages suffered by the plaintiff, and (4) that the plaintiff suffered damages. Beyette v. Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., 823 F.2d 990, 992 (6th Cir.1987); Warner v. General Motors Corp., 137 Mich.App. 340, 348, 357 N.W.2d 689 (1984), leave to appeal denied.
To establish a prima facie case that a manufacturer's breach of its duty to warn was a proximate cause of an injury sustained, a plaintiff must present evidence that the product would have been used differently had the proffered warnings been given. Mowery v. Crittenton Hospital, 155 Mich.App. 711, 722, 400 N.W.2d 633 (1986); Downie v. Kent Products, 122 Mich.App. 722, 734, 333 N.W.2d 528 (1983); Dunn v. Lederle Laboratories, 121 Mich.App. 73, 85, 328 N.W.2d 576 (1982); Muilenberg v. Upjohn Co., 115 Mich.App. 316, 332, 320 N.W.2d 358 (1982). In the absence of evidence that a warning would have prevented the harm complained of by altering the plaintiff's conduct, the failure to warn cannot be deemed a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injury as a matter of law. Dunn, 121 Mich.App. at 85, 328 N.W.2d 576.
 Similarly, a failure to warn cannot be deemed a proximate cause of injury if the plaintiff knew of the danger about which he claims the defendant failed to warn. Vroman v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 387 F.2d 732 (6th Cir.1967).
A manufacturer has a duty "to warn the purchasers or users of its product about dangers associated with intended use." Rusin v. Glendale Optical Co., Inc., 805 F.2d 650, 653 (6th Cir.1986). Conversely, a manufacturer has no duty to warn of a danger arising from an unforeseeable misuse of its product. Trotter v. Hamil Manufacturing Co., 143 Mich.App. 593, 372 N.W.2d 622 (1985). Thus, whether a manufacturer has a duty to warn depends on whether the use of the product and the injury sustained by it are foreseeable. Gootee v. Colt Industries Inc., 712 F.2d 1057, 1065 (6th Cir.1983); Owens v. Allis-Chalmers Corp., 414 Mich. 413, 425, 326 N.W.2d 372 (1982). Whether a plaintiff's use of a product is foreseeable is a legal question to be resolved by the court. Trotter, supra. Whether the resulting injury is foreseeable is a question of fact for the jury. Thomas, v. International Harvester Co., 57 Mich.App. 79, 225 N.W.2d 175 (1974).
In the instant action no reasonable jury could find that JJP's failure to warn of the flammability of cotton batting was a proximate cause of plaintiffs' injuries because plaintiffs failed to offer any evidence to establish that a flammability warning on JJP's cotton batting would have dissuaded them from using the product in the manner that they did.
Plaintiffs repeatedly stated in their response brief that plaintiff Susan Ferlito testified that "she would never again use cotton batting to make a costume." Plaintiffs' Answer to Defendant JJP's Motion for J.N.O.V., pp. 1, 3, 4, 5. However, a review of the trial transcript reveals that plaintiff Susan Ferlito never testified that she would never again use cotton batting to make a costume. More importantly, the transcript contains no statement by plaintiff Susan Ferlito that a flammability warning on defendant JJP's product would have dissuaded her from using the cotton batting to construct the costume in the first place. At oral argument counsel for plaintiffs conceded that there was no testimony during the trial that either plaintiff Susan Ferlito or her husband, plaintiff Frank J. Ferlito, would have acted any differently if there had been a flammability warning on the product's package. The absence of such testimony is fatal to plaintiffs' case; for without it, plaintiffs have failed to prove proximate cause, one of the essential elements of their negligence claim.
In addition, both plaintiffs testified that they knew that cotton batting burns when it is exposed to flame. Susan Ferlito testified that she knew at the time she purchased the cotton batting that it would burn if exposed to an open flame. Frank Ferlito testified that he knew at the time he appeared at the Halloween party that cotton batting would burn if exposed to an open flame. His additional testimony that he would not have intentionally put a flame to the cotton batting shows that he recognized the risk of injury of which he claims JJP should have warned. Because both plaintiffs were already aware of the danger, a warning by JJP would have been superfluous. Therefore, a reasonable jury could not have found that JJP's failure to provide a warning was a proximate cause of plaintiffs' injuries.
The evidence in this case clearly demonstrated that neither the use to which plaintiffs put JJP's product nor the injuries arising from that use were foreseeable. Susan Ferlito testified that the idea for the costume was hers alone. As described on the product's package, its intended uses are for cleansing, applying medications, and infant care. Plaintiffs' showing that the product may be used on occasion in classrooms for decorative purposes failed to demonstrate the foreseeability of an adult male encapsulating himself from head to toe in cotton batting and then lighting up a cigarette.
MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL
Defendant JJP has moved, in the alternative, for a new trial. Lest there be any  confusion over the consequences of a reversal of the judgment in favor of the defendant, the court will grant a new trial if for any reason the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reverses the decision to grant defendant's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.
In determining whether to grant a motion for new trial, unlike a motion for j.n.o.v., the trial court may weigh the evidence presented. A court can exercise its discretion to grant a new trial if the verdict, even though supported by sufficient evidence to defeat a motion for j.n.o.v., is against the great weight of the evidence. Taylor v. Home Ins. Co., 777 F.2d 849, 855 (4th Cir.1985). The decision to grant or deny a new trial is one "confided almost entirely in the exercise of discretion on the part of the trial court." Morin v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., 691 F.2d 811, 816 (6th Cir.1982).
Defendant JJP predicates its motion for new trial on two grounds. First, JJP argues that the jury's verdict was against the great weight of evidence presented at trial. For the reasons set forth supra, I agree. Second, JJP argues that the jury's verdict was inconsistent. When a jury returns a verdict which is inconsistent, the trial court must attempt to reconcile the verdict. Where a verdict cannot be reconciled, a new trial must be granted. Hopkins v. Coen, 431 F.2d 1055, 1059 (6th Cir.1970).
In the instant case the jury was given a special verdict form. The jury was asked whether JJP was negligent in failing to warn plaintiffs of the flammability of cotton batting. The jury was also asked whether plaintiffs were negligent. The jury responded affirmatively to both questions, finding plaintiffs 50 percent negligent. However, the only evidence upon which the jury could base a finding of comparative negligence by plaintiffs was their use of cotton batting to construct a costume and their exposure of that costume to an open flame. The jury's finding of comparative negligence necessarily means that it concluded that plaintiffs knew or should have known of the flammability of cotton batting. If that was the jury's conclusion, then JJP had no duty to warn and the jury's verdict ignored the court's instructions.
The court is satisfied that the test for a new trial described in Bruner v. Dunaway, 684 F.2d 422, 425 (6th Cir.1982) (in order to grant a new trial the verdict must be against the clear weight of evidence), has been met here.
ORDER
NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that defendant JJP's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is GRANTED.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the judgment entered November 2, 1989, is SET ASIDE.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the clerk will enter a judgment in favor of the defendant JJP.

Frankoma Pottery

Front and back of a piece of Frankoma pottery.


Frankoma Pottery is an ongoing American pottery company located in Sapulpa, Oklahoma. The company is widely known for its sculptures and dinnerware although the company made many other products including figurines, trivets, and vases. All Frankoma pottery is made in the United States from locally dug clay.[1] The company continues to manufacture hand-made pottery even today.
History[edit]
Frankoma was founded by John Frank in Norman, Oklahoma, in 1933. Frank had been a professor in ceramics at the University of Oklahoma at Norman from 1927 to 1936 and used light-hued local Ada clay in his initial products. He moved the company to Sapulpa in 1938, only to soon rebuild that factory after a fire later that year.[2] The name Frankoma was created from Frank's last name and the last three letters of the state of Oklahoma.
The light Ada clay was replaced by brick-red local clay in 1953.[2] John Frank operated the pottery with his wife Grace Lee Frank until his death in 1973. The factory was rebuilt in 1984 after a September 1983 fire destroyed most of the facility;[3][4] the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1990.[2] His daughter Joniece ran the pottery until 1991 when she was forced to sell the struggling company. In 1991 Richard Bernstein of Maryland purchased Frankoma and in 2005 sold the business to Det Merryman.[5]
The company was closed for six weeks and was sold again during the summer of 2008, reopening on August 18 with new owner Joe Ragosta. Ragosta planned to bring back all the employees and continue the Frankoma line of pottery.[6] The year 2008 marked the company's 75 year anniversary.[1] It closed in 2010 and then went on the auction block on May 18, 2011. Over a thousand pieces of pottery plus showroom fixtures and equipment were sold. The 1,800 original molds and the Frankoma name were not included in the sale. The real estate also was not part of the auction.[7][8] In August 2012, the factory building was sold to a non-pottery manufacturer. Also in that month, the original Frankoma molds and trademark name were sold to a limited liability company called FPC LLC. As of December 2012, Frankoma Pottery was back in business according to a website at www.frankomapottery.com.[1] Pottery continues to be made, but, in lower volume quantities with artware being the primary focus.
Each year in late September, collectors from across the nation meet to celebrate the company's fine products. Events include a Show and Sale, presentations about the company's past, a dinner, etc. Most of the attendees belong to one of the various Facebook groups concerning Frankoma Pottery.
The University of Oklahoma's Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art opened an Oklahoma Clay: Frankoma Pottery exhibition in 2012, documenting Oklahoma culture through pottery.[9]

Our position of leadership and our strategic relationships allow us to provide special benefits to eligible members of qualifying groups. From low-down-payment options to Wells Fargo exclusive programs, such as the Union PlusÂ® Mortgage program, you can be confident that your buyers have options that meet their needs.     Builder focused programs    Mortgage products    Consumer benefit programs      Builder BestÂ® Extended Rate Lock program Give your buyers the ultimate interest rate security Our Builder Best Extended Rate Lock program protects your buyers against interest rate changes while their home is being built, regardless of market fluctuations. A non-refundable extended rate lock fee is required. As a builder, this provides you the security that a rising rate environment will not negatively impact your pipelines and customers' abilities to finance. Your buyers may be able to:  Lock in interest rates from 5 months up to 12 months on conforming mortgages. Lock in interest rates from 5 months up to 24 months on jumbo mortgages. If interest rates decline, buyers may seek to exercise a one-time float down to the current interest rate, or switch to another eligible product, subject to credit approval, within 60 days of actual loan closing.    Â Builder Lock OptionsÂ   Our Builder Lock OptionsSM help you advertise rate protection, even in a volatile market.

Condominium financing Condominium financing can be a confusing topic for developers, sales professionals, and borrowers alike.

Jumbo loans allow qualified buyers to finance loan amounts above maximum conforming limits, helping them take advantage of today's home prices and low interest rates. Consider our jumbo loans for your homebuyers in higher-priced housing markets, including those who have a goal of purchasing a second home, resort condo, or rental property.

VA loans VA loans offer low- and no-down payment options for veterans and other borrowers who meet the eligibility requirements of the VA program.  Learn more    Fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages Fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages are two of the most popular loan types. Both options are available for conventional conforming loan amounts, jumbo (non-conforming) loan amounts, and FHA or VA programs. Fixed-rate mortgage A fixed-rate mortgage carries the same interest rate and monthly principal and interest payments for the life of the loan, which protects your homebuyers from rising interest rates and allows them to budget their monthly mortgage payments more easily. This loan type may be a good choice for your buyers who plan to stay in their homes for a long time. Adjustable-rate mortgage An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) has the same interest rate and principal and interest payments a defined initial period, then adjusts annually when that initial period is over. Typically, ARMs have a lower initial interest rate than fixed-rate mortgages. After the initial fixed period, your buyer's rates and payments may increase. This loan type may be a good option for your buyers who plan to move or refinance within a few years.

About Pfalz
Get the Full Story






                        
                        The Pfalz, which begins south of Rheinhessen and is in effect the northward extension of Alsace's Vosges foothills, is the warmest and driest of Germany's Riesling regions, supporting fuller-bodied wines that are typically dry. In fact, the soil here, like Alsace, shows great diversity, marked by alluvial gravel and various types of sedimentary rocks, as opposed to the near exclusive domination of slate in the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer.  Like the Rheinhessen better known until recently for quantity than for quality, the Pfalz's handful of top villages and vineyards have nevertheless always been among Germany's most cherished, and the entire region has undergone a substantial turnabout in reputation over the last two decade. While only about one-fifth of the vineyards are planted to Riesling, the grape holds a disproportionate position in the top growing sites, just like elsewhere in the Rhine.

About Germany
Get the Full Story






German vintners and Germany's wine law have often been their own worst enemies, and consumers understandably bemoan the unintelligibility of the labels as well as the mediocre quality of so many commercial-grade wines. It is a shame if this situation acts as a barrier to appreciating some of the world's most distinctive and versatile wines. In fact, an excellent case can be made that no other class of wine offers the stylistic diversity, nuanced expression of site and climate, and versatility at the table of German Riesling. These German wines can be adamantly dry, off-dry, or downright sweet. German Reisling wines can be complex and satisfyingly complete at a mere 7% alcohol, yet can also avoid coming off as heavy at over 14%.
The tradition of Riesling excellence in Germany makes two important presuppositions over and beyond the talents of the individual vintner. First, in a generally cool environment incorporating Europe's northernmost significant vineyards, the microclimatic conditions of a given vineyard site--its exposure to the sun, shelter from wind, proximity to water, geological underpinnings, and other environmental factors--are of paramount importance. Second, to get the most out of Riesling's potential in a good site, the grapes in any given parcel are generally harvested in multiple passes, at times weeks apart, in a process that often involves the selection of particular bunches or occasionally even of individual berries. These factors explain why most of the best German Rieslings preserve their vineyard identity and are labeled to reflect this. They also reflect the many pickings of a given vineyard through labeling with different designations of descriptions or taste.

About Riesling

Flavor Profile

From dry to sweet, with all styles showing pronounced minerality and acidity







The Riesling grape may scare away some wine novices. In Germany, where the grape reaches its finest expression, labels hew to a rigid, abstruse set of classifications, leaving newcomers with little idea what they may be looking at. Furthermore, many wine drinkers' early experiences with sweet wines from Germany (think Blue Nun), have not been especially rewarding. We say that it's your loss if you continue to fear the tall, flute-shaped bottles. Sweet does not necessarily equal cloying, and not all Rieslings are even sweet. Push aside these negative perceptions, and discover a complex, delicate, and elegant white wine that expresses the unique characteristics of its growing region.
Riesling originated in the Rhine Valley in Germany, and it continues to flourish here as well as in the neighboring Mosel region. German producers are selective about where they plant their Riesling. It accounts for only 20% of the total plantings in the country, but has priority on steep, slate hillsides, where the soil imparts steely minerality. Here, in Europe's northernmost vineyards of any significance, microclimatic conditions are especially influential to the final product, for the Riesling grape is especially transparent to terroir. In each vineyard, the exposure to the sun, shelter from wind, proximity to water, and other factors contribute to the distinct qualities of a given wine. The timing of the harvest is just as important to the finished wine: on any given site, producers will make multiple passes to collect grapes at differing degrees of ripeness. This allows Riesling to be bottled with different levels of residual sugar: from dry, to semi-dry, to sweet. The residual sugar content also determines the suitability of these wines for cellaring, as sugar and acidity both aid in their preservation.
As a general rule, wines from the Mosel are more expensive and sought-after than wines from the Rhine. But vineyard-to-vineyard distinctions are just as important as those between the regions, and outstanding (and expensive) wines can be found in both locales. Correspondingly, specific flavors will vary from site to site, with some bottlings showcasing varied citrus fruits and others delivering notes of red fruits or apples. Reliable producers include Joh. Jos. PrÃ¼m and Reinhold Haart. In the Rhine, look for Gunderloch and Josef Leitz.
For an indication of the transparency of the Riesling grape, move to warmer-weather Alsace. Here, increased (but not overpowering) heat and a longer growing season leads to grapes with less delicacy, lower acidity, and increased fresh fruit flavors. Even still, these wines are praised more for intensity of flavor or elegance, rather than sheer power or weight. In Alsace's grand cru vineyards, sites known to have especially strong ripening conditions and soil with enhanced minerality help craft wines with greater complexity and aging potential. Bottlings bearing the names of these grand crus (e.g. Schlossberg, Sommerberg) will of course demand higher prices. Consider wines from Domaine Zind-Humbrecht, Josmeyer, and Trimbach.
While Riesling is planted sporadically in other countries, including Austria and Australia, as well as Oregon, Washington, and New York's Finger Lakes region, it rarely achieves the stylishness and grace found in Germany or Alsace. That doesn't mean that these wines should be avoided, for they can be the source of good values-- for example, wines from the Clare Valley in Australia.
Because of its combination of sweetness and acidity, Riesling is an especially versatile wine with food. It works well with fish or pork and is one of the few wines that can hold its own again spicy cuisines like Indian, Chinese, and Thai.

Description



Product Description
Frank, John P. LINCOLN AS A LAWYER. Chicago: 1991. 2 nd Edition, 208p. New Introduction by Cullom Davis.
A fine study by a former professor at the Yale University law school and law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black.
Lincoln spent 25 years as a lawyer; no one can truly understand him as a public figure without knowing these years. Frankâs fine, analytical, study reveals the strong points of Lincolnâs mind that made him a great practitioner of the law, and also a great politician.
Although the genre of Lincoln legal studies is thriving in the 21st Century, Lincoln as a Lawyer has not been supplanted.
Hard cover. As new; dust jacket.

Product Descriptionâ¼â²
Church History, Volume 2: From Pre-Reformation to the Present Day examines the rise and growth of the church in its cultural, intellectual and political context. Offering a rich contextual view of how the Christian church spread and developed,  Church History authors Frank James and John Woodbridge also emphasize that the church's life did not occur in a vacuum, but at specific times in certain places, within cultures that were both influenced by and influenced the church. This second volume displays the growth of the church from just prior to the Reformation through the next five hundred plus years into the present. Filled with maps, charts, and illustrations, it is an account of the ups and downs, the triumphs and struggles, of the Christian movement and offers previously unavailable perspective and approach to church history that understands history as a big picture full of life and events. Designed to fully integrate all of the senses in learning, this book makes an excellent text for students to not only retrieve information from, but to experience history.

Publisher's Descriptionâ¼â²
Church history is the story of the greatest community the world has known and the greatest movement in world history. Yet, just as the biblical record of the people of God is the story of a mixed people with great acts of faith and great failures in sin and unfaithfulness, so is the history of the people who have made up the church down through the ages. Â  Church History, Volume Two is an account of the ups and downs, the triumphs and struggles, of the Christian movement. It offers a unique contextual view of how the Christian church spread and developed from the just prior to the Reformation and through the next five-hundred-plus years into the present-day. This book looks closely at the integral link between the history of the world and that of the church, detailing the times, cultures, and events that both influenced and were influenced by the church. Â  Filled with maps, charts, and illustrations, gives primary attention to the history of Christianity in the West (western Europe and North America), but given the global and ecumenical environment of the twenty-first century, it also covers Africa, eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America.

 Retail Distribution Lists
FSIS has reason to believe that the retail locations listed received the recalled meat or poultry products described in the news release.
Lists may not include all retail locations that have received the recalled product or may include retail locations that did not actually receive the recalled product. Therefore, it is important that you use the product-specific identification information in the news release, in addition to this list of retail stores, to check meat or poultry products in your possession to see if they have been recalled.
For large volume recalls, it may take several days to assemble the initial list. Lists may be updated as additional information becomes available.
"No retail sales" indicates that no retailers were identified for the recall in question. For example, the product may have gone exclusively to restaurants and institutions, and in this case there would be no retailers in the distribution chain.
Finally, FSIS will provide lists when retail sales are associated with a Class I recall. There will be no distribution lists associated with Class II or Class III recalls.
