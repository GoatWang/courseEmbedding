Early life[edit]
Zacconi was born in 1968 in Rome, Italy. He attended Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli in Rome from where he graduated in 1993 with a Bachelor's degree in economics.[3][4]
Career[edit]
After leaving university, Zacconi worked as a consultant. One of his roles during this time included a six-year period as project manager at Boston Consulting Group, between 1993 and 1999. His first career role was as a consultant during a two year long stint at LEK consulting, between 1991 and 1993.[5][6][7]
At the start of the dotcom boom in 1999, Zacconi joined the Swedish online messaging startup Spray before it was purchased by Lycos Europe in 2000.[8][9]
In 2001, he left Spray and moved to the UK to become vice president of European sales and marketing at Terrence "Lee" Zehrer's uDate.

He has since grown the company into one of the most successful mobile gaming businesses worldwide.[10][11]

According to an interview in the Daily Telegraph, he also has a positive reputation in San Francisco as a leading tech figure following a dinner with Mark Zuckerberg.

King Digital Entertainment plc, doing business as King, is a social games development company. King develops games for the web, for mobile (iOS, Android, Windows Phone), Facebook, and Windows 10.[1][2] King gained fame after releasing the cross-platform title Candy Crush Saga in 2012, considered the first successful game utilizing the freemium model. King was acquired by Activision Blizzard in February 2016 for $5.9 billion, and operates as its own entity within that company.[3]
King is led by Riccardo Zacconi, who has served in that role since co-founding the company in 2003.[4] Gerhard Florin is the current Chairman of Board. He took over from Melvyn Morris when he stepped down in November 2014. The company has 1400 employees.[5] In 2013, it spent $110.5 million on research and development, roughly 6 percent of sales.[6]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Prior to founding King, Riccardo Zacconi and Toby Rowland, the only son of famous British businessman Tiny Rowland, had worked together on uDate.com, a dating website created by Melvyn Morris which by 2003 was the second-largest one in the world.[7] Morris opted to sell site to the leading dating website Match.com (a subsidiary of IAC) for $150 million in 2003.[7][8]
Zacconi and Rowland joined with Sebastian Knutsson, Thomas Hartwig, Lars Markgren and Patrik Stymne, all whom had worked previously with Zacconi at the failed dot-com web portal Spray, to create a new company with angel investment provided by Morris.[7] King.com was founded in Sweden in 2003, and initially started with the development of browser-based video games. Morris served as Chairman, while Zacconi and Rowland were co-CEOs.[9]
Initially, King.com was not profitable, and nearly went bankrupt until a cash infusion from Morris on Christmas Eve of 2003 helped to finance the company.[4] By 2005, the company had been able to turn a profit.[4] During this year, the company raised $43 million by selling a large stake to Apax Partners and Index Ventures.[9] This investment was the last one that the company received before its initial public offering in 2014.[10] King.com continued to develop games for its web portal, which it would also share to other web portals like Yahoo![11] By 2009, the company was making about $60 million annually.[12] Rowland departed the company in 2008 to found Magnahigh, a web portal aimed for educational math games,[13] and sold his stake back to the company for $3 million in 2011.[8] Angel investor and former board member Klaus Hommels sold his similar stake at the same time.[9]
Transition to social gaming[edit]
Around 2009, social network games on Facebook began to gain popularity, led primarily through games developed by Zynga. King.com saw a significant drop in players on their portal games as a result, and started to develop their own Facebook-based games using the games already developed on the King.com portal, with their first such game released in 2010.[14] King.com used their web portal as a testing grounds for new game ideas and determine which ones to bring to Facebook, as well as determining how to implement various microtransactions for tournament-style play into the Facebook games.[15] Their first cross-platform web portal/Facebook game, Miner Speed, which allowed sharing of player information between platforms, was released in 2011, and was a simple match-3 tile game inspired by Bejeweled.[16] Following this model, in October 2011, the company released Bubble Witch Saga to both platforms. Bubble Witch Saga introduced the nature of a "saga" game, that instead of playing the same gameboard for as long as the player could continue to match matches, that instead the game offered individual levels that would challenge the player to complete certain goals in a limited number of turns. These saga elements allowed for the basics of social gameplay, but did not require the time investment that then-popular titles like Zynga's Farmville required; players could play just for a few minutes each day through the saga model.[17] The formula proved extremely successful, and January 2012, Bubble Witch Saga had over 10 million players and was one of the most-played Facebook games.[18] By April 2012, King.com had the second largest player count, around 30 million unique users,[9] second only to Zynga on the Facebook platform.[11][14] Facebook's director of games partnerships Sean Ryan described King.com's growth on the platform as "They were not a flash in the pan -- they've been around seven years. But they came out of no where in an area that was unexpected."[19] King.com next released Candy Crush Saga in April 2012, based on the popularity of its Candy Crush web-portal game and following the saga model from Bubble Witch Saga.[20] The game attracted more than 4 million players within a few weeks.[21]
The popularity of Bubble Witch Saga and Candy Crush Saga led King.com to start a new strategy into developing for the growing mobile game market, in a manner that would allow players to synchronize with the Facebook platform. Zacconi said that "As consumers and the industry focus more on games for mobile devices, launching a truly cross-platform Facebook game has been a top priority for King.com."[22] A mobile version for iOS device of Bubble Witch Saga was released in July 2012,[22] while the iOS mobile version of Candy Crush Saga was released in October 2012.[23] Both games saw boosts in the number of unique players with the mobile introduction; King.com saw that previously-declining player counts for Bubble Witch Saga become steady with the mobile version's release, while Candy Crush Saga saw more than 5.2 million unique players on Facebook in November 2012 and which were continuing to climb. Additionally, in-game advertising, which factored into about 15% of King.com's revenues, had increased ten-fold from 2011 into 2012.[24] Users jumped to 408 million by the end of 2013.[9] Revenues for King.com increased from a little over $62 million in 2011 to $1.88 billion in 2013.[9]
In March 2013, on the ten-year anniversary of the its founding, the company announced it was dropping the ".com" part of its branding and would continue on as just "King".[25]
Initial public offering[edit]
In mid-2013, King.com had considered filing an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States. Zacconi had said that "The IPO is an option...We are building the company and part of that is investigating options."[26]
The company applied for initial public offering (IPO) in September 2013. Its filing was made using allowances in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act to keep details of the IPO secret until it was to be offered. The IPO was backed by Bank of America, Merrill Lynch Corp, Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The IPO gained great interest, as it followed Zynga's $1 billion IPO in 2011 and Twitter's IPO earlier in the month.[10]
King completed its on 26 March 2014. Priced at $22.50 a share, the middle of its projected price range, the IPO valued the company at US$7.08 billion. About $500 million was raised through the sale of 22.2 million shares. Of that, 15.3 million shares came from the company and the rest from Apax and other stakeholders. It was the largest ever IPO for a mobile/social gaming company in the US, narrowly eclipsing Zynga's 2011 offering.[4] To celebrate the debut, Candy Crush mascots took to the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Morris is the company's largest shareholder with approximately 35.6 million shares valued at $821 million.[7][8] The company began trading under the "KING" symbol on the New York Stock Exchange.[4]
Shares of King fell 15.6% on the first day of trading, closing at $19.[8] By June, the company's valuation had dropped by $2 billion, though otherwise was still profitable. Zacconi noted that their strategy from this point was not to find another "mega-hit" like Candy Crush Saga, but to "build a portfolio of games", carrying King's game design approach to other genres.[12] Revenue following the IPO were over $2.6 billion in 2014, with Candy Crush Saga generating nearly half of that amount.[27]
Subsidiary of Activision Blizzard (2015-present)[edit]
In November 2015, Activision Blizzard announced its plans to acquire King Digital Entertainment for $5.9 billion. Upon announcement of the news, USA Today reported that "the deal gives Activision immediate access to the growing mobile gaming audience, the fastest-rising sector in video games."[28] On 23 February 2016, Activision Blizzard closed its acquisition of King Digital Entertainment for a deal of $5.9 billion.[3] Activision Blizzard as a result operates the world's largest game network,[29] reaching around 500 million users[29] in 196 countries.[30] About the King acquisition, the CEO of Activision Blizzard explained that "we see great opportunities to create new ways for audiences to experience their favorite franchises, from Candy Crush to World of Warcraft to Call of Duty and more, across mobile devices, consoles and personal computers."[29]

Revenue model[edit]
King's games, prior to June 2013, made revenue for the company through a combination of in-game advertising and microtransactions. These microtransactions allow for players to use funds to purchase in-game booster items that could be used to help clear certain levels, additional lives, and immediate access to new levels instead of having to wait for a few days.
In June 2013, the company opted to remove all in-game advertising from their games, relying solely on microtransactions. The company stated that due to their "focus around delivering an uninterrupted entertainment experience for our network of loyal players across web, tablet and mobile has unfortunately led to the difficult decision of removing advertising as a core element of King's overall strategy".[31] Advertising revenue had only made up 10% of the company's earnings in 2012, and only 1% within 2013; the company in its IPO files stated they do not anticipate any further earnings from advertising revenue.[32] While King relies heavily on in-game purchases, it is estimated that only single-digit percentages of all players of their games have spent money on their titles. In Q4 2014, King had 356 million monthly unique users, with 8.3 million of them spending money. The 2.3% that pay spent an average of $23.42 a month within the games.[27] King stated that their model is aimed to continue to draw existing and new players to all of their games: "If the cost to acquire players is greater than the revenue we generate over time from those players and if we cannot successfully migrate our current players to new games and new platforms as we have historically done so, our business and operating results will be harmed".[32]
Games[edit]
King games offer synchronized play, enabling users to connect to their Facebook account whilst playing on their smartphone or tablet device. This means that the user's progress is updated across all platforms, allowing the player to switch from smartphone, to tablet, to Facebook without losing their progress in the game.[33][34] They also offer two of their games to connect to KakaoTalk in South Korea.
Bubble Witch Saga was King's first mobile game, released in July 2012 after its launch on Facebook in September 2011.[35][36] Bubble Witch Saga and its sequel Bubble Witch 2 Saga are versions of Puzzle Bobble.[37] Papa Pear Saga was released in March 2013 on Facebook, it is a Peggle variation.[38] Pepper Panic Saga was released in January 2014 as a matching game on Facebook.[39] It was ranked the 23rd most played game on Facebook in January 2014.[40] Around 2012, Pyramid Solitaire Saga was soft launched on Facebook. It was released on mobile in May 2014.[41] In late 2012 Pet Rescue Saga was launched on Facebook, then on iOS and Android In June 2013, Candy Crush Soda Saga was soft launched on Facebook and mobile[42] and Bubble Witch 2 Saga was widely released for Android and iOS devices.[43] In November 2014, Candy Crush Soda Saga was widely released on Android and iOS.[44] Alpha Betty Saga launched on Facebook in April 2015. This game is a variation of Bookworm.
In 2013, King acquired the Defold game engine, developed by Ragnar Svensson and Christian Murray in 2007 as a lightweight 2D game engine. The two had offered the engine to King as well as their services as contractors to support it, and later bought the engine, using it first for the game Blossom Blast Saga.[45] In March 2016, King released the Defold engine as a free development tool for any user.[46]
King announced in April 2017 that they will be developing a mobile Call of Duty game, a property owned by Activision; the game would be one of the first ones outside of the casual mobile space for the company.[47]
Candy Crush Saga[edit]

King's most popular game is Candy Crush Saga, which was launched on King's website in March 2011, which is a tile-matching game.[48] It launched on Facebook in April 2012 and quickly gained popularity.

The game was downloaded over 10 million times in its first month.[49][50] In January 2013, it became the number one most played game on Facebook.[2][51] It had over 45 million monthly users in March 2013.

Trademark and cloning disputes[edit]
In January 2014, King attracted controversy after attempting to trademark the words "Candy" and "Saga" in game titles.[58] This directly impacted Stoic's trademark request for The Banner Saga, to which King filed an opposition, calling the name "deceptively similar" to King games.[58] Stoic said that the dispute hindered work on a planned sequel to their game.[59] The developer Runsome Apps opposed King's trademark of the term "candy" on grounds of "likelihood of confusion", referencing its CandySwipe game, that was published two years before Candy Crush Saga. King subsequently contested the trademark of "CandySwipe". In February 2014, Runsome Apps ceased legal action and opposition towards King, while posting an open letter shaming King's business practices regarding trademarks.[60] On 17 April 2014, it was reported that King has settled its disputes with Stoic Studio and Runsome Apps.[61]
Also in January 2014, game developer Matthew Cox accused King of ripping off his game Scamperghost, saying King's Pac-Avoid was a clone of it. According to Cox, he was in talks with King about licensing Scamperghost, but when the deal fell through the company released the game Pac-Avoid. Cox said Epicshadows, the developer of Pac-Avoid, told him that King had approached them to "clone the game very quickly".[62] King removed the game from its website, but denied the cloning allegation, stating that they were removing the game "for the avoidance of doubt".[63] Later, in an official statement on the company's website, King stated: "The details of the situation are complex, but the bottom line is that we should never have published Pac-Avoid. We have taken the game down from our site, and we apologise for having published it in the first place. Let me be clear: This unfortunate situation is an exception to the rule. King does not clone games, and we do not want anyone cloning our games."[64]

King Digital Entertainment plc, doing business as King, is a social games development company. King develops games for the web, for mobile (iOS, Android, Windows Phone), Facebook, and Windows 10.[1][2] King gained fame after releasing the cross-platform title Candy Crush Saga in 2012, considered the first successful game utilizing the freemium model. King was acquired by Activision Blizzard in February 2016 for $5.9 billion, and operates as its own entity within that company.[3]
King is led by Riccardo Zacconi, who has served in that role since co-founding the company in 2003.[4] Gerhard Florin is the current Chairman of Board. He took over from Melvyn Morris when he stepped down in November 2014. The company has 1400 employees.[5] In 2013, it spent $110.5 million on research and development, roughly 6 percent of sales.[6]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Prior to founding King, Riccardo Zacconi and Toby Rowland, the only son of famous British businessman Tiny Rowland, had worked together on uDate.com, a dating website created by Melvyn Morris which by 2003 was the second-largest one in the world.[7] Morris opted to sell site to the leading dating website Match.com (a subsidiary of IAC) for $150 million in 2003.[7][8]
Zacconi and Rowland joined with Sebastian Knutsson, Thomas Hartwig, Lars Markgren and Patrik Stymne, all whom had worked previously with Zacconi at the failed dot-com web portal Spray, to create a new company with angel investment provided by Morris.[7] King.com was founded in Sweden in 2003, and initially started with the development of browser-based video games. Morris served as Chairman, while Zacconi and Rowland were co-CEOs.[9]
Initially, King.com was not profitable, and nearly went bankrupt until a cash infusion from Morris on Christmas Eve of 2003 helped to finance the company.[4] By 2005, the company had been able to turn a profit.[4] During this year, the company raised $43 million by selling a large stake to Apax Partners and Index Ventures.[9] This investment was the last one that the company received before its initial public offering in 2014.[10] King.com continued to develop games for its web portal, which it would also share to other web portals like Yahoo![11] By 2009, the company was making about $60 million annually.[12] Rowland departed the company in 2008 to found Magnahigh, a web portal aimed for educational math games,[13] and sold his stake back to the company for $3 million in 2011.[8] Angel investor and former board member Klaus Hommels sold his similar stake at the same time.[9]
Transition to social gaming[edit]
Around 2009, social network games on Facebook began to gain popularity, led primarily through games developed by Zynga. King.com saw a significant drop in players on their portal games as a result, and started to develop their own Facebook-based games using the games already developed on the King.com portal, with their first such game released in 2010.[14] King.com used their web portal as a testing grounds for new game ideas and determine which ones to bring to Facebook, as well as determining how to implement various microtransactions for tournament-style play into the Facebook games.[15] Their first cross-platform web portal/Facebook game, Miner Speed, which allowed sharing of player information between platforms, was released in 2011, and was a simple match-3 tile game inspired by Bejeweled.[16] Following this model, in October 2011, the company released Bubble Witch Saga to both platforms. Bubble Witch Saga introduced the nature of a "saga" game, that instead of playing the same gameboard for as long as the player could continue to match matches, that instead the game offered individual levels that would challenge the player to complete certain goals in a limited number of turns. These saga elements allowed for the basics of social gameplay, but did not require the time investment that then-popular titles like Zynga's Farmville required; players could play just for a few minutes each day through the saga model.[17] The formula proved extremely successful, and January 2012, Bubble Witch Saga had over 10 million players and was one of the most-played Facebook games.[18] By April 2012, King.com had the second largest player count, around 30 million unique users,[9] second only to Zynga on the Facebook platform.[11][14] Facebook's director of games partnerships Sean Ryan described King.com's growth on the platform as "They were not a flash in the pan -- they've been around seven years. But they came out of no where in an area that was unexpected."[19] King.com next released Candy Crush Saga in April 2012, based on the popularity of its Candy Crush web-portal game and following the saga model from Bubble Witch Saga.[20] The game attracted more than 4 million players within a few weeks.[21]
The popularity of Bubble Witch Saga and Candy Crush Saga led King.com to start a new strategy into developing for the growing mobile game market, in a manner that would allow players to synchronize with the Facebook platform. Zacconi said that "As consumers and the industry focus more on games for mobile devices, launching a truly cross-platform Facebook game has been a top priority for King.com."[22] A mobile version for iOS device of Bubble Witch Saga was released in July 2012,[22] while the iOS mobile version of Candy Crush Saga was released in October 2012.[23] Both games saw boosts in the number of unique players with the mobile introduction; King.com saw that previously-declining player counts for Bubble Witch Saga become steady with the mobile version's release, while Candy Crush Saga saw more than 5.2 million unique players on Facebook in November 2012 and which were continuing to climb. Additionally, in-game advertising, which factored into about 15% of King.com's revenues, had increased ten-fold from 2011 into 2012.[24] Users jumped to 408 million by the end of 2013.[9] Revenues for King.com increased from a little over $62 million in 2011 to $1.88 billion in 2013.[9]
In March 2013, on the ten-year anniversary of the its founding, the company announced it was dropping the ".com" part of its branding and would continue on as just "King".[25]
Initial public offering[edit]
In mid-2013, King.com had considered filing an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States. Zacconi had said that "The IPO is an option...We are building the company and part of that is investigating options."[26]
The company applied for initial public offering (IPO) in September 2013. Its filing was made using allowances in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act to keep details of the IPO secret until it was to be offered. The IPO was backed by Bank of America, Merrill Lynch Corp, Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The IPO gained great interest, as it followed Zynga's $1 billion IPO in 2011 and Twitter's IPO earlier in the month.[10]
King completed its on 26 March 2014. Priced at $22.50 a share, the middle of its projected price range, the IPO valued the company at US$7.08 billion. About $500 million was raised through the sale of 22.2 million shares. Of that, 15.3 million shares came from the company and the rest from Apax and other stakeholders. It was the largest ever IPO for a mobile/social gaming company in the US, narrowly eclipsing Zynga's 2011 offering.[4] To celebrate the debut, Candy Crush mascots took to the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Morris is the company's largest shareholder with approximately 35.6 million shares valued at $821 million.[7][8] The company began trading under the "KING" symbol on the New York Stock Exchange.[4]
Shares of King fell 15.6% on the first day of trading, closing at $19.[8] By June, the company's valuation had dropped by $2 billion, though otherwise was still profitable. Zacconi noted that their strategy from this point was not to find another "mega-hit" like Candy Crush Saga, but to "build a portfolio of games", carrying King's game design approach to other genres.[12] Revenue following the IPO were over $2.6 billion in 2014, with Candy Crush Saga generating nearly half of that amount.[27]
Subsidiary of Activision Blizzard (2015-present)[edit]
In November 2015, Activision Blizzard announced its plans to acquire King Digital Entertainment for $5.9 billion. Upon announcement of the news, USA Today reported that "the deal gives Activision immediate access to the growing mobile gaming audience, the fastest-rising sector in video games."[28] On 23 February 2016, Activision Blizzard closed its acquisition of King Digital Entertainment for a deal of $5.9 billion.[3] Activision Blizzard as a result operates the world's largest game network,[29] reaching around 500 million users[29] in 196 countries.[30] About the King acquisition, the CEO of Activision Blizzard explained that "we see great opportunities to create new ways for audiences to experience their favorite franchises, from Candy Crush to World of Warcraft to Call of Duty and more, across mobile devices, consoles and personal computers."[29]

Revenue model[edit]
King's games, prior to June 2013, made revenue for the company through a combination of in-game advertising and microtransactions. These microtransactions allow for players to use funds to purchase in-game booster items that could be used to help clear certain levels, additional lives, and immediate access to new levels instead of having to wait for a few days.
In June 2013, the company opted to remove all in-game advertising from their games, relying solely on microtransactions. The company stated that due to their "focus around delivering an uninterrupted entertainment experience for our network of loyal players across web, tablet and mobile has unfortunately led to the difficult decision of removing advertising as a core element of King's overall strategy".[31] Advertising revenue had only made up 10% of the company's earnings in 2012, and only 1% within 2013; the company in its IPO files stated they do not anticipate any further earnings from advertising revenue.[32] While King relies heavily on in-game purchases, it is estimated that only single-digit percentages of all players of their games have spent money on their titles. In Q4 2014, King had 356 million monthly unique users, with 8.3 million of them spending money. The 2.3% that pay spent an average of $23.42 a month within the games.[27] King stated that their model is aimed to continue to draw existing and new players to all of their games: "If the cost to acquire players is greater than the revenue we generate over time from those players and if we cannot successfully migrate our current players to new games and new platforms as we have historically done so, our business and operating results will be harmed".[32]
Games[edit]
King games offer synchronized play, enabling users to connect to their Facebook account whilst playing on their smartphone or tablet device. This means that the user's progress is updated across all platforms, allowing the player to switch from smartphone, to tablet, to Facebook without losing their progress in the game.[33][34] They also offer two of their games to connect to KakaoTalk in South Korea.
Bubble Witch Saga was King's first mobile game, released in July 2012 after its launch on Facebook in September 2011.[35][36] Bubble Witch Saga and its sequel Bubble Witch 2 Saga are versions of Puzzle Bobble.[37] Papa Pear Saga was released in March 2013 on Facebook, it is a Peggle variation.[38] Pepper Panic Saga was released in January 2014 as a matching game on Facebook.[39] It was ranked the 23rd most played game on Facebook in January 2014.[40] Around 2012, Pyramid Solitaire Saga was soft launched on Facebook. It was released on mobile in May 2014.[41] In late 2012 Pet Rescue Saga was launched on Facebook, then on iOS and Android In June 2013, Candy Crush Soda Saga was soft launched on Facebook and mobile[42] and Bubble Witch 2 Saga was widely released for Android and iOS devices.[43] In November 2014, Candy Crush Soda Saga was widely released on Android and iOS.[44] Alpha Betty Saga launched on Facebook in April 2015. This game is a variation of Bookworm.
In 2013, King acquired the Defold game engine, developed by Ragnar Svensson and Christian Murray in 2007 as a lightweight 2D game engine. The two had offered the engine to King as well as their services as contractors to support it, and later bought the engine, using it first for the game Blossom Blast Saga.[45] In March 2016, King released the Defold engine as a free development tool for any user.[46]
King announced in April 2017 that they will be developing a mobile Call of Duty game, a property owned by Activision; the game would be one of the first ones outside of the casual mobile space for the company.[47]

The game was downloaded over 10 million times in its first month.[49][50] In January 2013, it became the number one most played game on Facebook.[2][51] It had over 45 million monthly users in March 2013.

Trademark and cloning disputes[edit]
In January 2014, King attracted controversy after attempting to trademark the words "Candy" and "Saga" in game titles.[58] This directly impacted Stoic's trademark request for The Banner Saga, to which King filed an opposition, calling the name "deceptively similar" to King games.[58] Stoic said that the dispute hindered work on a planned sequel to their game.[59] The developer Runsome Apps opposed King's trademark of the term "candy" on grounds of "likelihood of confusion", referencing its CandySwipe game, that was published two years before Candy Crush Saga. King subsequently contested the trademark of "CandySwipe". In February 2014, Runsome Apps ceased legal action and opposition towards King, while posting an open letter shaming King's business practices regarding trademarks.[60] On 17 April 2014, it was reported that King has settled its disputes with Stoic Studio and Runsome Apps.[61]
Also in January 2014, game developer Matthew Cox accused King of ripping off his game Scamperghost, saying King's Pac-Avoid was a clone of it. According to Cox, he was in talks with King about licensing Scamperghost, but when the deal fell through the company released the game Pac-Avoid. Cox said Epicshadows, the developer of Pac-Avoid, told him that King had approached them to "clone the game very quickly".[62] King removed the game from its website, but denied the cloning allegation, stating that they were removing the game "for the avoidance of doubt".[63] Later, in an official statement on the company's website, King stated: "The details of the situation are complex, but the bottom line is that we should never have published Pac-Avoid. We have taken the game down from our site, and we apologise for having published it in the first place. Let me be clear: This unfortunate situation is an exception to the rule. King does not clone games, and we do not want anyone cloning our games."[64]

First published on Tuesday 25 March 2014 10.34 EDT






King Digital Entertainment, the British and Swedish games studio behind smartphone hit Candy Crush, will be valued at $7bn when it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, as investors show a renewed appetite for technology firms.
Shares in the company behind the wildly popular smartphone game Candy Crush will fluctuate wildly when they begin trading, but it is clear that King's biggest shareholders will suddenly be very rich. Based on the expected flotation price of up to $22.50 (£13.60) a share, here is what the shareholders are worth:
Melvyn Morris, chairman, estimated shareholding value $821m
36,467,500 shares

A self-made millionaire, Morris has chaired King since 2003. He left school at 16 and by 20 was earning a living as a management consultant. He worked in the US before returning to his home town of Derby, where he started a handful of businesses including a hardwood flooring company, a Spanish property group and a dating agency. When uDate was sold in 2002, it was the second-largest dating site in the world. Morris netted £20m and spent part of the money buying a stake in his beloved Derby County football club and part of it establishing King.
Riccardo Zacconi, chief executive, $698m

King's urbane Italian chief executive was born in Rome, where he studied economics, and started his career at Boston Consulting. He was lured into digital business during the dotcom boom, and ran the German unit of a Swedish web portal called Spray, which failed to make it to the stockmarket before the bubble burst. Zacconi moved to the UK in 2001 to look for digital investments, and by 2002 had been persuaded to join uDate. 
The company was sold soon after for $150m and merged with Match.com. he eventually launched King with colleagues from Spray, and persuaded some of uDate's backers, including Melvyn Morris and Toby Rowland, to join the new venture. Spray missed its window to make it rich after delaying its IPO by a month and was sold to Lycos instead. Zacconi's timing looks better with King.

One of King's founders, Knutsson recently claimed to have designed 10 of the company's 15 worst games – it has made 180 so far – but Candy Crush also emerged from his Stockholm studio. A keen gamer himself, his vivid designs are inspired by the multicoloured, flashing and bleeping arcade games of the last century, from Pac-Man to Space Invaders and Tetris.
He also has a business brain, thanks to a BA in cost-analysis and finance from the Stockholm School of Economics, and comes from a family of entrepreneurs. His parents ran a denim brand and retail chain, and his sister has her own clothing company. Knutsson co-founded Spray, where he met Zacconi.
Lars Markgren, Sweden general manager, $203m

Stockholm-based Markgren worked at Spray, along with many of King's founders, before moving into gaming. He manages the pivotal Swedish operations and balances work with a passion for pike-fishing.

Another co-founder, Hartwig is the brains behind King's data strategy, harvesting information from the 1.4bn game plays a day to hone each product from its testing phase on the King.com website through to its launch as a standalone smartphone app. He places data scientists in each of the small, typically 10-strong teams developing new King games, collating user experience to decide, for example, how difficult to make each successive level. Like his co-founders, Hartwig cut his teeth at Spray.
Gerhard Florin, non-executive director, $25m

  Gerhard Florin


Having joined the board during the hard times in 2010, Florin has stuck around long enough to reap the benefits. Now a full-time non-executive director, he spent 14 years in senior roles at Electronic Arts, the world's third-largest gaming company and maker of the Fifa football games and the sci-fi shooter Titanfall.
Apax Partners, investor, $3.25bn
144,330,001 shares
King was one of the last venture capital investments Apax made before focusing on taking more mature companies private. It is also the British buyout firm's most successful bet to date. Apax, whose holdings include the fashion chain New Look, the Orange mobile network in Switzerland and a trade publishing joint venture with the Guardian's parent company, injected about $36m in 2005, and its 48% stake is now worth almost 100 times that.
Index Ventures, investor, $562m
24,992,502 shares
Index is a legend in technology venture capital, having backed Facebook and Skype, as well as British successes such as the clothing retailer Asos and the Moshi Monsters maker Mind Candy. Index invested alongside Apax in 2005, putting in an estimated $7m.
Toby Rowland, founder, $0
No shares

Toby Rowland co-founded King with Morris and Zacconi and was co-chief executive until 2008, but he sold his shares in 2011, just months before the company launched its first hit Facebook game. He is married to the author and Vogue journalist Plum Sykes, and his father was the mining tycoon Tiny Rowland, who once owned the Observer and House of Fraser department stores. Morris persuaded him to move to Derby and become marketing director of uDate. 
He invested and shared in the spoils when the site was sold for $150m, using the proceeds to set up King. Despite backing the company for eight years, like the founding Beatles member Pete Best, Rowland left too early to share in its success. His 40m shares were sold back to King for a mere $3m, according to data from PrivCo. Had Rowland stayed in, he would have been King's largest individual shareholder today, with a stake worth up to $900m.

King Digital Entertainment plc, doing business as King, is a social games development company. King develops games for the web, for mobile (iOS, Android, Windows Phone), Facebook, and Windows 10.[1][2] King gained fame after releasing the cross-platform title Candy Crush Saga in 2012, considered the first successful game utilizing the freemium model. King was acquired by Activision Blizzard in February 2016 for $5.9 billion, and operates as its own entity within that company.[3]
King is led by Riccardo Zacconi, who has served in that role since co-founding the company in 2003.[4] Gerhard Florin is the current Chairman of Board. He took over from Melvyn Morris when he stepped down in November 2014. The company has 1400 employees.[5] In 2013, it spent $110.5 million on research and development, roughly 6 percent of sales.[6]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Prior to founding King, Riccardo Zacconi and Toby Rowland, the only son of famous British businessman Tiny Rowland, had worked together on uDate.com, a dating website created by Melvyn Morris which by 2003 was the second-largest one in the world.[7] Morris opted to sell site to the leading dating website Match.com (a subsidiary of IAC) for $150 million in 2003.[7][8]
Zacconi and Rowland joined with Sebastian Knutsson, Thomas Hartwig, Lars Markgren and Patrik Stymne, all whom had worked previously with Zacconi at the failed dot-com web portal Spray, to create a new company with angel investment provided by Morris.[7] King.com was founded in Sweden in 2003, and initially started with the development of browser-based video games. Morris served as Chairman, while Zacconi and Rowland were co-CEOs.[9]
Initially, King.com was not profitable, and nearly went bankrupt until a cash infusion from Morris on Christmas Eve of 2003 helped to finance the company.[4] By 2005, the company had been able to turn a profit.[4] During this year, the company raised $43 million by selling a large stake to Apax Partners and Index Ventures.[9] This investment was the last one that the company received before its initial public offering in 2014.[10] King.com continued to develop games for its web portal, which it would also share to other web portals like Yahoo![11] By 2009, the company was making about $60 million annually.[12] Rowland departed the company in 2008 to found Magnahigh, a web portal aimed for educational math games,[13] and sold his stake back to the company for $3 million in 2011.[8] Angel investor and former board member Klaus Hommels sold his similar stake at the same time.[9]
Transition to social gaming[edit]
Around 2009, social network games on Facebook began to gain popularity, led primarily through games developed by Zynga. King.com saw a significant drop in players on their portal games as a result, and started to develop their own Facebook-based games using the games already developed on the King.com portal, with their first such game released in 2010.[14] King.com used their web portal as a testing grounds for new game ideas and determine which ones to bring to Facebook, as well as determining how to implement various microtransactions for tournament-style play into the Facebook games.[15] Their first cross-platform web portal/Facebook game, Miner Speed, which allowed sharing of player information between platforms, was released in 2011, and was a simple match-3 tile game inspired by Bejeweled.[16] Following this model, in October 2011, the company released Bubble Witch Saga to both platforms. Bubble Witch Saga introduced the nature of a "saga" game, that instead of playing the same gameboard for as long as the player could continue to match matches, that instead the game offered individual levels that would challenge the player to complete certain goals in a limited number of turns. These saga elements allowed for the basics of social gameplay, but did not require the time investment that then-popular titles like Zynga's Farmville required; players could play just for a few minutes each day through the saga model.[17] The formula proved extremely successful, and January 2012, Bubble Witch Saga had over 10 million players and was one of the most-played Facebook games.[18] By April 2012, King.com had the second largest player count, around 30 million unique users,[9] second only to Zynga on the Facebook platform.[11][14] Facebook's director of games partnerships Sean Ryan described King.com's growth on the platform as "They were not a flash in the pan -- they've been around seven years. But they came out of no where in an area that was unexpected."[19] King.com next released Candy Crush Saga in April 2012, based on the popularity of its Candy Crush web-portal game and following the saga model from Bubble Witch Saga.[20] The game attracted more than 4 million players within a few weeks.[21]
The popularity of Bubble Witch Saga and Candy Crush Saga led King.com to start a new strategy into developing for the growing mobile game market, in a manner that would allow players to synchronize with the Facebook platform. Zacconi said that "As consumers and the industry focus more on games for mobile devices, launching a truly cross-platform Facebook game has been a top priority for King.com."[22] A mobile version for iOS device of Bubble Witch Saga was released in July 2012,[22] while the iOS mobile version of Candy Crush Saga was released in October 2012.[23] Both games saw boosts in the number of unique players with the mobile introduction; King.com saw that previously-declining player counts for Bubble Witch Saga become steady with the mobile version's release, while Candy Crush Saga saw more than 5.2 million unique players on Facebook in November 2012 and which were continuing to climb. Additionally, in-game advertising, which factored into about 15% of King.com's revenues, had increased ten-fold from 2011 into 2012.[24] Users jumped to 408 million by the end of 2013.[9] Revenues for King.com increased from a little over $62 million in 2011 to $1.88 billion in 2013.[9]
In March 2013, on the ten-year anniversary of the its founding, the company announced it was dropping the ".com" part of its branding and would continue on as just "King".[25]
Initial public offering[edit]
In mid-2013, King.com had considered filing an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States. Zacconi had said that "The IPO is an option...We are building the company and part of that is investigating options."[26]
The company applied for initial public offering (IPO) in September 2013. Its filing was made using allowances in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act to keep details of the IPO secret until it was to be offered. The IPO was backed by Bank of America, Merrill Lynch Corp, Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The IPO gained great interest, as it followed Zynga's $1 billion IPO in 2011 and Twitter's IPO earlier in the month.[10]
King completed its on 26 March 2014. Priced at $22.50 a share, the middle of its projected price range, the IPO valued the company at US$7.08 billion. About $500 million was raised through the sale of 22.2 million shares. Of that, 15.3 million shares came from the company and the rest from Apax and other stakeholders. It was the largest ever IPO for a mobile/social gaming company in the US, narrowly eclipsing Zynga's 2011 offering.[4] To celebrate the debut, Candy Crush mascots took to the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Morris is the company's largest shareholder with approximately 35.6 million shares valued at $821 million.[7][8] The company began trading under the "KING" symbol on the New York Stock Exchange.[4]
Shares of King fell 15.6% on the first day of trading, closing at $19.[8] By June, the company's valuation had dropped by $2 billion, though otherwise was still profitable. Zacconi noted that their strategy from this point was not to find another "mega-hit" like Candy Crush Saga, but to "build a portfolio of games", carrying King's game design approach to other genres.[12] Revenue following the IPO were over $2.6 billion in 2014, with Candy Crush Saga generating nearly half of that amount.[27]
Subsidiary of Activision Blizzard (2015-present)[edit]
In November 2015, Activision Blizzard announced its plans to acquire King Digital Entertainment for $5.9 billion. Upon announcement of the news, USA Today reported that "the deal gives Activision immediate access to the growing mobile gaming audience, the fastest-rising sector in video games."[28] On 23 February 2016, Activision Blizzard closed its acquisition of King Digital Entertainment for a deal of $5.9 billion.[3] Activision Blizzard as a result operates the world's largest game network,[29] reaching around 500 million users[29] in 196 countries.[30] About the King acquisition, the CEO of Activision Blizzard explained that "we see great opportunities to create new ways for audiences to experience their favorite franchises, from Candy Crush to World of Warcraft to Call of Duty and more, across mobile devices, consoles and personal computers."[29]

Revenue model[edit]
King's games, prior to June 2013, made revenue for the company through a combination of in-game advertising and microtransactions. These microtransactions allow for players to use funds to purchase in-game booster items that could be used to help clear certain levels, additional lives, and immediate access to new levels instead of having to wait for a few days.
In June 2013, the company opted to remove all in-game advertising from their games, relying solely on microtransactions. The company stated that due to their "focus around delivering an uninterrupted entertainment experience for our network of loyal players across web, tablet and mobile has unfortunately led to the difficult decision of removing advertising as a core element of King's overall strategy".[31] Advertising revenue had only made up 10% of the company's earnings in 2012, and only 1% within 2013; the company in its IPO files stated they do not anticipate any further earnings from advertising revenue.[32] While King relies heavily on in-game purchases, it is estimated that only single-digit percentages of all players of their games have spent money on their titles. In Q4 2014, King had 356 million monthly unique users, with 8.3 million of them spending money. The 2.3% that pay spent an average of $23.42 a month within the games.[27] King stated that their model is aimed to continue to draw existing and new players to all of their games: "If the cost to acquire players is greater than the revenue we generate over time from those players and if we cannot successfully migrate our current players to new games and new platforms as we have historically done so, our business and operating results will be harmed".[32]
Games[edit]
King games offer synchronized play, enabling users to connect to their Facebook account whilst playing on their smartphone or tablet device. This means that the user's progress is updated across all platforms, allowing the player to switch from smartphone, to tablet, to Facebook without losing their progress in the game.[33][34] They also offer two of their games to connect to KakaoTalk in South Korea.
Bubble Witch Saga was King's first mobile game, released in July 2012 after its launch on Facebook in September 2011.[35][36] Bubble Witch Saga and its sequel Bubble Witch 2 Saga are versions of Puzzle Bobble.[37] Papa Pear Saga was released in March 2013 on Facebook, it is a Peggle variation.[38] Pepper Panic Saga was released in January 2014 as a matching game on Facebook.[39] It was ranked the 23rd most played game on Facebook in January 2014.[40] Around 2012, Pyramid Solitaire Saga was soft launched on Facebook. It was released on mobile in May 2014.[41] In late 2012 Pet Rescue Saga was launched on Facebook, then on iOS and Android In June 2013, Candy Crush Soda Saga was soft launched on Facebook and mobile[42] and Bubble Witch 2 Saga was widely released for Android and iOS devices.[43] In November 2014, Candy Crush Soda Saga was widely released on Android and iOS.[44] Alpha Betty Saga launched on Facebook in April 2015. This game is a variation of Bookworm.
In 2013, King acquired the Defold game engine, developed by Ragnar Svensson and Christian Murray in 2007 as a lightweight 2D game engine. The two had offered the engine to King as well as their services as contractors to support it, and later bought the engine, using it first for the game Blossom Blast Saga.[45] In March 2016, King released the Defold engine as a free development tool for any user.[46]
King announced in April 2017 that they will be developing a mobile Call of Duty game, a property owned by Activision; the game would be one of the first ones outside of the casual mobile space for the company.[47]

Trademark and cloning disputes[edit]
In January 2014, King attracted controversy after attempting to trademark the words "Candy" and "Saga" in game titles.[58] This directly impacted Stoic's trademark request for The Banner Saga, to which King filed an opposition, calling the name "deceptively similar" to King games.[58] Stoic said that the dispute hindered work on a planned sequel to their game.[59] The developer Runsome Apps opposed King's trademark of the term "candy" on grounds of "likelihood of confusion", referencing its CandySwipe game, that was published two years before Candy Crush Saga. King subsequently contested the trademark of "CandySwipe". In February 2014, Runsome Apps ceased legal action and opposition towards King, while posting an open letter shaming King's business practices regarding trademarks.[60] On 17 April 2014, it was reported that King has settled its disputes with Stoic Studio and Runsome Apps.[61]
Also in January 2014, game developer Matthew Cox accused King of ripping off his game Scamperghost, saying King's Pac-Avoid was a clone of it. According to Cox, he was in talks with King about licensing Scamperghost, but when the deal fell through the company released the game Pac-Avoid. Cox said Epicshadows, the developer of Pac-Avoid, told him that King had approached them to "clone the game very quickly".[62] King removed the game from its website, but denied the cloning allegation, stating that they were removing the game "for the avoidance of doubt".[63] Later, in an official statement on the company's website, King stated: "The details of the situation are complex, but the bottom line is that we should never have published Pac-Avoid. We have taken the game down from our site, and we apologise for having published it in the first place. Let me be clear: This unfortunate situation is an exception to the rule. King does not clone games, and we do not want anyone cloning our games."[64]

Career[edit]
After leaving university, Zacconi worked as a consultant. One of his roles during this time included a six-year period as project manager at Boston Consulting Group, between 1993 and 1999. His first career role was as a consultant during a two year long stint at LEK consulting, between 1991 and 1993.[5][6][7]
At the start of the dotcom boom in 1999, Zacconi joined the Swedish online messaging startup Spray before it was purchased by Lycos Europe in 2000.[8][9]
In 2001, he left Spray and moved to the UK to become vice president of European sales and marketing at Terrence "Lee" Zehrer's uDate. He left this company shortly after its merger with Match.com and in March 2003, he co-founded King Digital Entertainment, becoming the CEO. He has since grown the company into one of the most successful mobile gaming businesses worldwide.[10][11]

King Digital Entertainment plc, doing business as King, is a social games development company. King develops games for the web, for mobile (iOS, Android, Windows Phone), Facebook, and Windows 10.[1][2] King gained fame after releasing the cross-platform title Candy Crush Saga in 2012, considered the first successful game utilizing the freemium model. King was acquired by Activision Blizzard in February 2016 for $5.9 billion, and operates as its own entity within that company.[3]
King is led by Riccardo Zacconi, who has served in that role since co-founding the company in 2003.[4] Gerhard Florin is the current Chairman of Board. He took over from Melvyn Morris when he stepped down in November 2014. The company has 1400 employees.[5] In 2013, it spent $110.5 million on research and development, roughly 6 percent of sales.[6]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Prior to founding King, Riccardo Zacconi and Toby Rowland, the only son of famous British businessman Tiny Rowland, had worked together on uDate.com, a dating website created by Melvyn Morris which by 2003 was the second-largest one in the world.[7] Morris opted to sell site to the leading dating website Match.com (a subsidiary of IAC) for $150 million in 2003.[7][8]
Zacconi and Rowland joined with Sebastian Knutsson, Thomas Hartwig, Lars Markgren and Patrik Stymne, all whom had worked previously with Zacconi at the failed dot-com web portal Spray, to create a new company with angel investment provided by Morris.[7] King.com was founded in Sweden in 2003, and initially started with the development of browser-based video games. Morris served as Chairman, while Zacconi and Rowland were co-CEOs.[9]
Initially, King.com was not profitable, and nearly went bankrupt until a cash infusion from Morris on Christmas Eve of 2003 helped to finance the company.[4] By 2005, the company had been able to turn a profit.[4] During this year, the company raised $43 million by selling a large stake to Apax Partners and Index Ventures.[9] This investment was the last one that the company received before its initial public offering in 2014.[10] King.com continued to develop games for its web portal, which it would also share to other web portals like Yahoo![11] By 2009, the company was making about $60 million annually.[12] Rowland departed the company in 2008 to found Magnahigh, a web portal aimed for educational math games,[13] and sold his stake back to the company for $3 million in 2011.[8] Angel investor and former board member Klaus Hommels sold his similar stake at the same time.[9]
Transition to social gaming[edit]
Around 2009, social network games on Facebook began to gain popularity, led primarily through games developed by Zynga. King.com saw a significant drop in players on their portal games as a result, and started to develop their own Facebook-based games using the games already developed on the King.com portal, with their first such game released in 2010.[14] King.com used their web portal as a testing grounds for new game ideas and determine which ones to bring to Facebook, as well as determining how to implement various microtransactions for tournament-style play into the Facebook games.[15] Their first cross-platform web portal/Facebook game, Miner Speed, which allowed sharing of player information between platforms, was released in 2011, and was a simple match-3 tile game inspired by Bejeweled.[16] Following this model, in October 2011, the company released Bubble Witch Saga to both platforms. Bubble Witch Saga introduced the nature of a "saga" game, that instead of playing the same gameboard for as long as the player could continue to match matches, that instead the game offered individual levels that would challenge the player to complete certain goals in a limited number of turns. These saga elements allowed for the basics of social gameplay, but did not require the time investment that then-popular titles like Zynga's Farmville required; players could play just for a few minutes each day through the saga model.[17] The formula proved extremely successful, and January 2012, Bubble Witch Saga had over 10 million players and was one of the most-played Facebook games.[18] By April 2012, King.com had the second largest player count, around 30 million unique users,[9] second only to Zynga on the Facebook platform.[11][14] Facebook's director of games partnerships Sean Ryan described King.com's growth on the platform as "They were not a flash in the pan -- they've been around seven years. But they came out of no where in an area that was unexpected."[19] King.com next released Candy Crush Saga in April 2012, based on the popularity of its Candy Crush web-portal game and following the saga model from Bubble Witch Saga.[20] The game attracted more than 4 million players within a few weeks.[21]
The popularity of Bubble Witch Saga and Candy Crush Saga led King.com to start a new strategy into developing for the growing mobile game market, in a manner that would allow players to synchronize with the Facebook platform. Zacconi said that "As consumers and the industry focus more on games for mobile devices, launching a truly cross-platform Facebook game has been a top priority for King.com."[22] A mobile version for iOS device of Bubble Witch Saga was released in July 2012,[22] while the iOS mobile version of Candy Crush Saga was released in October 2012.[23] Both games saw boosts in the number of unique players with the mobile introduction; King.com saw that previously-declining player counts for Bubble Witch Saga become steady with the mobile version's release, while Candy Crush Saga saw more than 5.2 million unique players on Facebook in November 2012 and which were continuing to climb. Additionally, in-game advertising, which factored into about 15% of King.com's revenues, had increased ten-fold from 2011 into 2012.[24] Users jumped to 408 million by the end of 2013.[9] Revenues for King.com increased from a little over $62 million in 2011 to $1.88 billion in 2013.[9]
In March 2013, on the ten-year anniversary of the its founding, the company announced it was dropping the ".com" part of its branding and would continue on as just "King".[25]
Initial public offering[edit]
In mid-2013, King.com had considered filing an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States. Zacconi had said that "The IPO is an option...We are building the company and part of that is investigating options."[26]
The company applied for initial public offering (IPO) in September 2013. Its filing was made using allowances in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act to keep details of the IPO secret until it was to be offered. The IPO was backed by Bank of America, Merrill Lynch Corp, Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The IPO gained great interest, as it followed Zynga's $1 billion IPO in 2011 and Twitter's IPO earlier in the month.[10]
King completed its on 26 March 2014. Priced at $22.50 a share, the middle of its projected price range, the IPO valued the company at US$7.08 billion. About $500 million was raised through the sale of 22.2 million shares. Of that, 15.3 million shares came from the company and the rest from Apax and other stakeholders. It was the largest ever IPO for a mobile/social gaming company in the US, narrowly eclipsing Zynga's 2011 offering.[4] To celebrate the debut, Candy Crush mascots took to the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Morris is the company's largest shareholder with approximately 35.6 million shares valued at $821 million.[7][8] The company began trading under the "KING" symbol on the New York Stock Exchange.[4]
Shares of King fell 15.6% on the first day of trading, closing at $19.[8] By June, the company's valuation had dropped by $2 billion, though otherwise was still profitable. Zacconi noted that their strategy from this point was not to find another "mega-hit" like Candy Crush Saga, but to "build a portfolio of games", carrying King's game design approach to other genres.[12] Revenue following the IPO were over $2.6 billion in 2014, with Candy Crush Saga generating nearly half of that amount.[27]
Subsidiary of Activision Blizzard (2015-present)[edit]
In November 2015, Activision Blizzard announced its plans to acquire King Digital Entertainment for $5.9 billion. Upon announcement of the news, USA Today reported that "the deal gives Activision immediate access to the growing mobile gaming audience, the fastest-rising sector in video games."[28] On 23 February 2016, Activision Blizzard closed its acquisition of King Digital Entertainment for a deal of $5.9 billion.[3] Activision Blizzard as a result operates the world's largest game network,[29] reaching around 500 million users[29] in 196 countries.[30] About the King acquisition, the CEO of Activision Blizzard explained that "we see great opportunities to create new ways for audiences to experience their favorite franchises, from Candy Crush to World of Warcraft to Call of Duty and more, across mobile devices, consoles and personal computers."[29]

Revenue model[edit]
King's games, prior to June 2013, made revenue for the company through a combination of in-game advertising and microtransactions. These microtransactions allow for players to use funds to purchase in-game booster items that could be used to help clear certain levels, additional lives, and immediate access to new levels instead of having to wait for a few days.
In June 2013, the company opted to remove all in-game advertising from their games, relying solely on microtransactions. The company stated that due to their "focus around delivering an uninterrupted entertainment experience for our network of loyal players across web, tablet and mobile has unfortunately led to the difficult decision of removing advertising as a core element of King's overall strategy".[31] Advertising revenue had only made up 10% of the company's earnings in 2012, and only 1% within 2013; the company in its IPO files stated they do not anticipate any further earnings from advertising revenue.[32] While King relies heavily on in-game purchases, it is estimated that only single-digit percentages of all players of their games have spent money on their titles. In Q4 2014, King had 356 million monthly unique users, with 8.3 million of them spending money. The 2.3% that pay spent an average of $23.42 a month within the games.[27] King stated that their model is aimed to continue to draw existing and new players to all of their games: "If the cost to acquire players is greater than the revenue we generate over time from those players and if we cannot successfully migrate our current players to new games and new platforms as we have historically done so, our business and operating results will be harmed".[32]
Games[edit]
King games offer synchronized play, enabling users to connect to their Facebook account whilst playing on their smartphone or tablet device. This means that the user's progress is updated across all platforms, allowing the player to switch from smartphone, to tablet, to Facebook without losing their progress in the game.[33][34] They also offer two of their games to connect to KakaoTalk in South Korea.
Bubble Witch Saga was King's first mobile game, released in July 2012 after its launch on Facebook in September 2011.[35][36] Bubble Witch Saga and its sequel Bubble Witch 2 Saga are versions of Puzzle Bobble.[37] Papa Pear Saga was released in March 2013 on Facebook, it is a Peggle variation.[38] Pepper Panic Saga was released in January 2014 as a matching game on Facebook.[39] It was ranked the 23rd most played game on Facebook in January 2014.[40] Around 2012, Pyramid Solitaire Saga was soft launched on Facebook. It was released on mobile in May 2014.[41] In late 2012 Pet Rescue Saga was launched on Facebook, then on iOS and Android In June 2013, Candy Crush Soda Saga was soft launched on Facebook and mobile[42] and Bubble Witch 2 Saga was widely released for Android and iOS devices.[43] In November 2014, Candy Crush Soda Saga was widely released on Android and iOS.[44] Alpha Betty Saga launched on Facebook in April 2015. This game is a variation of Bookworm.
In 2013, King acquired the Defold game engine, developed by Ragnar Svensson and Christian Murray in 2007 as a lightweight 2D game engine. The two had offered the engine to King as well as their services as contractors to support it, and later bought the engine, using it first for the game Blossom Blast Saga.[45] In March 2016, King released the Defold engine as a free development tool for any user.[46]
King announced in April 2017 that they will be developing a mobile Call of Duty game, a property owned by Activision; the game would be one of the first ones outside of the casual mobile space for the company.[47]

Trademark and cloning disputes[edit]
In January 2014, King attracted controversy after attempting to trademark the words "Candy" and "Saga" in game titles.[58] This directly impacted Stoic's trademark request for The Banner Saga, to which King filed an opposition, calling the name "deceptively similar" to King games.[58] Stoic said that the dispute hindered work on a planned sequel to their game.[59] The developer Runsome Apps opposed King's trademark of the term "candy" on grounds of "likelihood of confusion", referencing its CandySwipe game, that was published two years before Candy Crush Saga. King subsequently contested the trademark of "CandySwipe". In February 2014, Runsome Apps ceased legal action and opposition towards King, while posting an open letter shaming King's business practices regarding trademarks.[60] On 17 April 2014, it was reported that King has settled its disputes with Stoic Studio and Runsome Apps.[61]
Also in January 2014, game developer Matthew Cox accused King of ripping off his game Scamperghost, saying King's Pac-Avoid was a clone of it. According to Cox, he was in talks with King about licensing Scamperghost, but when the deal fell through the company released the game Pac-Avoid. Cox said Epicshadows, the developer of Pac-Avoid, told him that King had approached them to "clone the game very quickly".[62] King removed the game from its website, but denied the cloning allegation, stating that they were removing the game "for the avoidance of doubt".[63] Later, in an official statement on the company's website, King stated: "The details of the situation are complex, but the bottom line is that we should never have published Pac-Avoid. We have taken the game down from our site, and we apologise for having published it in the first place. Let me be clear: This unfortunate situation is an exception to the rule. King does not clone games, and we do not want anyone cloning our games."[64]

King Digital Entertainment plc, doing business as King, is a social games development company. King develops games for the web, for mobile (iOS, Android, Windows Phone), Facebook, and Windows 10.[1][2] King gained fame after releasing the cross-platform title Candy Crush Saga in 2012, considered the first successful game utilizing the freemium model. King was acquired by Activision Blizzard in February 2016 for $5.9 billion, and operates as its own entity within that company.[3]
King is led by Riccardo Zacconi, who has served in that role since co-founding the company in 2003.[4] Gerhard Florin is the current Chairman of Board. He took over from Melvyn Morris when he stepped down in November 2014. The company has 1400 employees.[5] In 2013, it spent $110.5 million on research and development, roughly 6 percent of sales.[6]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Prior to founding King, Riccardo Zacconi and Toby Rowland, the only son of famous British businessman Tiny Rowland, had worked together on uDate.com, a dating website created by Melvyn Morris which by 2003 was the second-largest one in the world.[7] Morris opted to sell site to the leading dating website Match.com (a subsidiary of IAC) for $150 million in 2003.[7][8]
Zacconi and Rowland joined with Sebastian Knutsson, Thomas Hartwig, Lars Markgren and Patrik Stymne, all whom had worked previously with Zacconi at the failed dot-com web portal Spray, to create a new company with angel investment provided by Morris.[7] King.com was founded in Sweden in 2003, and initially started with the development of browser-based video games. Morris served as Chairman, while Zacconi and Rowland were co-CEOs.[9]
Initially, King.com was not profitable, and nearly went bankrupt until a cash infusion from Morris on Christmas Eve of 2003 helped to finance the company.[4] By 2005, the company had been able to turn a profit.[4] During this year, the company raised $43 million by selling a large stake to Apax Partners and Index Ventures.[9] This investment was the last one that the company received before its initial public offering in 2014.[10] King.com continued to develop games for its web portal, which it would also share to other web portals like Yahoo![11] By 2009, the company was making about $60 million annually.[12] Rowland departed the company in 2008 to found Magnahigh, a web portal aimed for educational math games,[13] and sold his stake back to the company for $3 million in 2011.[8] Angel investor and former board member Klaus Hommels sold his similar stake at the same time.[9]
Transition to social gaming[edit]
Around 2009, social network games on Facebook began to gain popularity, led primarily through games developed by Zynga. King.com saw a significant drop in players on their portal games as a result, and started to develop their own Facebook-based games using the games already developed on the King.com portal, with their first such game released in 2010.[14] King.com used their web portal as a testing grounds for new game ideas and determine which ones to bring to Facebook, as well as determining how to implement various microtransactions for tournament-style play into the Facebook games.[15] Their first cross-platform web portal/Facebook game, Miner Speed, which allowed sharing of player information between platforms, was released in 2011, and was a simple match-3 tile game inspired by Bejeweled.[16] Following this model, in October 2011, the company released Bubble Witch Saga to both platforms. Bubble Witch Saga introduced the nature of a "saga" game, that instead of playing the same gameboard for as long as the player could continue to match matches, that instead the game offered individual levels that would challenge the player to complete certain goals in a limited number of turns. These saga elements allowed for the basics of social gameplay, but did not require the time investment that then-popular titles like Zynga's Farmville required; players could play just for a few minutes each day through the saga model.[17] The formula proved extremely successful, and January 2012, Bubble Witch Saga had over 10 million players and was one of the most-played Facebook games.[18] By April 2012, King.com had the second largest player count, around 30 million unique users,[9] second only to Zynga on the Facebook platform.[11][14] Facebook's director of games partnerships Sean Ryan described King.com's growth on the platform as "They were not a flash in the pan -- they've been around seven years. But they came out of no where in an area that was unexpected."[19] King.com next released Candy Crush Saga in April 2012, based on the popularity of its Candy Crush web-portal game and following the saga model from Bubble Witch Saga.[20] The game attracted more than 4 million players within a few weeks.[21]
The popularity of Bubble Witch Saga and Candy Crush Saga led King.com to start a new strategy into developing for the growing mobile game market, in a manner that would allow players to synchronize with the Facebook platform. Zacconi said that "As consumers and the industry focus more on games for mobile devices, launching a truly cross-platform Facebook game has been a top priority for King.com."[22] A mobile version for iOS device of Bubble Witch Saga was released in July 2012,[22] while the iOS mobile version of Candy Crush Saga was released in October 2012.[23] Both games saw boosts in the number of unique players with the mobile introduction; King.com saw that previously-declining player counts for Bubble Witch Saga become steady with the mobile version's release, while Candy Crush Saga saw more than 5.2 million unique players on Facebook in November 2012 and which were continuing to climb. Additionally, in-game advertising, which factored into about 15% of King.com's revenues, had increased ten-fold from 2011 into 2012.[24] Users jumped to 408 million by the end of 2013.[9] Revenues for King.com increased from a little over $62 million in 2011 to $1.88 billion in 2013.[9]
In March 2013, on the ten-year anniversary of the its founding, the company announced it was dropping the ".com" part of its branding and would continue on as just "King".[25]
Initial public offering[edit]
In mid-2013, King.com had considered filing an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States. Zacconi had said that "The IPO is an option...We are building the company and part of that is investigating options."[26]
The company applied for initial public offering (IPO) in September 2013. Its filing was made using allowances in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act to keep details of the IPO secret until it was to be offered. The IPO was backed by Bank of America, Merrill Lynch Corp, Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The IPO gained great interest, as it followed Zynga's $1 billion IPO in 2011 and Twitter's IPO earlier in the month.[10]
King completed its on 26 March 2014. Priced at $22.50 a share, the middle of its projected price range, the IPO valued the company at US$7.08 billion. About $500 million was raised through the sale of 22.2 million shares. Of that, 15.3 million shares came from the company and the rest from Apax and other stakeholders. It was the largest ever IPO for a mobile/social gaming company in the US, narrowly eclipsing Zynga's 2011 offering.[4] To celebrate the debut, Candy Crush mascots took to the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Morris is the company's largest shareholder with approximately 35.6 million shares valued at $821 million.[7][8] The company began trading under the "KING" symbol on the New York Stock Exchange.[4]
Shares of King fell 15.6% on the first day of trading, closing at $19.[8] By June, the company's valuation had dropped by $2 billion, though otherwise was still profitable. Zacconi noted that their strategy from this point was not to find another "mega-hit" like Candy Crush Saga, but to "build a portfolio of games", carrying King's game design approach to other genres.[12] Revenue following the IPO were over $2.6 billion in 2014, with Candy Crush Saga generating nearly half of that amount.[27]
Subsidiary of Activision Blizzard (2015-present)[edit]
In November 2015, Activision Blizzard announced its plans to acquire King Digital Entertainment for $5.9 billion. Upon announcement of the news, USA Today reported that "the deal gives Activision immediate access to the growing mobile gaming audience, the fastest-rising sector in video games."[28] On 23 February 2016, Activision Blizzard closed its acquisition of King Digital Entertainment for a deal of $5.9 billion.[3] Activision Blizzard as a result operates the world's largest game network,[29] reaching around 500 million users[29] in 196 countries.[30] About the King acquisition, the CEO of Activision Blizzard explained that "we see great opportunities to create new ways for audiences to experience their favorite franchises, from Candy Crush to World of Warcraft to Call of Duty and more, across mobile devices, consoles and personal computers."[29]

Revenue model[edit]
King's games, prior to June 2013, made revenue for the company through a combination of in-game advertising and microtransactions. These microtransactions allow for players to use funds to purchase in-game booster items that could be used to help clear certain levels, additional lives, and immediate access to new levels instead of having to wait for a few days.
In June 2013, the company opted to remove all in-game advertising from their games, relying solely on microtransactions. The company stated that due to their "focus around delivering an uninterrupted entertainment experience for our network of loyal players across web, tablet and mobile has unfortunately led to the difficult decision of removing advertising as a core element of King's overall strategy".[31] Advertising revenue had only made up 10% of the company's earnings in 2012, and only 1% within 2013; the company in its IPO files stated they do not anticipate any further earnings from advertising revenue.[32] While King relies heavily on in-game purchases, it is estimated that only single-digit percentages of all players of their games have spent money on their titles. In Q4 2014, King had 356 million monthly unique users, with 8.3 million of them spending money. The 2.3% that pay spent an average of $23.42 a month within the games.[27] King stated that their model is aimed to continue to draw existing and new players to all of their games: "If the cost to acquire players is greater than the revenue we generate over time from those players and if we cannot successfully migrate our current players to new games and new platforms as we have historically done so, our business and operating results will be harmed".[32]
Games[edit]
King games offer synchronized play, enabling users to connect to their Facebook account whilst playing on their smartphone or tablet device. This means that the user's progress is updated across all platforms, allowing the player to switch from smartphone, to tablet, to Facebook without losing their progress in the game.[33][34] They also offer two of their games to connect to KakaoTalk in South Korea.
Bubble Witch Saga was King's first mobile game, released in July 2012 after its launch on Facebook in September 2011.[35][36] Bubble Witch Saga and its sequel Bubble Witch 2 Saga are versions of Puzzle Bobble.[37] Papa Pear Saga was released in March 2013 on Facebook, it is a Peggle variation.[38] Pepper Panic Saga was released in January 2014 as a matching game on Facebook.[39] It was ranked the 23rd most played game on Facebook in January 2014.[40] Around 2012, Pyramid Solitaire Saga was soft launched on Facebook. It was released on mobile in May 2014.[41] In late 2012 Pet Rescue Saga was launched on Facebook, then on iOS and Android In June 2013, Candy Crush Soda Saga was soft launched on Facebook and mobile[42] and Bubble Witch 2 Saga was widely released for Android and iOS devices.[43] In November 2014, Candy Crush Soda Saga was widely released on Android and iOS.[44] Alpha Betty Saga launched on Facebook in April 2015. This game is a variation of Bookworm.
In 2013, King acquired the Defold game engine, developed by Ragnar Svensson and Christian Murray in 2007 as a lightweight 2D game engine. The two had offered the engine to King as well as their services as contractors to support it, and later bought the engine, using it first for the game Blossom Blast Saga.[45] In March 2016, King released the Defold engine as a free development tool for any user.[46]
King announced in April 2017 that they will be developing a mobile Call of Duty game, a property owned by Activision; the game would be one of the first ones outside of the casual mobile space for the company.[47]

Trademark and cloning disputes[edit]
In January 2014, King attracted controversy after attempting to trademark the words "Candy" and "Saga" in game titles.[58] This directly impacted Stoic's trademark request for The Banner Saga, to which King filed an opposition, calling the name "deceptively similar" to King games.[58] Stoic said that the dispute hindered work on a planned sequel to their game.[59] The developer Runsome Apps opposed King's trademark of the term "candy" on grounds of "likelihood of confusion", referencing its CandySwipe game, that was published two years before Candy Crush Saga. King subsequently contested the trademark of "CandySwipe". In February 2014, Runsome Apps ceased legal action and opposition towards King, while posting an open letter shaming King's business practices regarding trademarks.[60] On 17 April 2014, it was reported that King has settled its disputes with Stoic Studio and Runsome Apps.[61]
Also in January 2014, game developer Matthew Cox accused King of ripping off his game Scamperghost, saying King's Pac-Avoid was a clone of it. According to Cox, he was in talks with King about licensing Scamperghost, but when the deal fell through the company released the game Pac-Avoid. Cox said Epicshadows, the developer of Pac-Avoid, told him that King had approached them to "clone the game very quickly".[62] King removed the game from its website, but denied the cloning allegation, stating that they were removing the game "for the avoidance of doubt".[63] Later, in an official statement on the company's website, King stated: "The details of the situation are complex, but the bottom line is that we should never have published Pac-Avoid. We have taken the game down from our site, and we apologise for having published it in the first place. Let me be clear: This unfortunate situation is an exception to the rule. King does not clone games, and we do not want anyone cloning our games."[64]

King Digital Entertainment plc, doing business as King, is a social games development company. King develops games for the web, for mobile (iOS, Android, Windows Phone), Facebook, and Windows 10.[1][2] King gained fame after releasing the cross-platform title Candy Crush Saga in 2012, considered the first successful game utilizing the freemium model. King was acquired by Activision Blizzard in February 2016 for $5.9 billion, and operates as its own entity within that company.[3]
King is led by Riccardo Zacconi, who has served in that role since co-founding the company in 2003.[4] Gerhard Florin is the current Chairman of Board. He took over from Melvyn Morris when he stepped down in November 2014. The company has 1400 employees.[5] In 2013, it spent $110.5 million on research and development, roughly 6 percent of sales.[6]

History[edit]
Founding[edit]
Prior to founding King, Riccardo Zacconi and Toby Rowland, the only son of famous British businessman Tiny Rowland, had worked together on uDate.com, a dating website created by Melvyn Morris which by 2003 was the second-largest one in the world.[7] Morris opted to sell site to the leading dating website Match.com (a subsidiary of IAC) for $150 million in 2003.[7][8]
Zacconi and Rowland joined with Sebastian Knutsson, Thomas Hartwig, Lars Markgren and Patrik Stymne, all whom had worked previously with Zacconi at the failed dot-com web portal Spray, to create a new company with angel investment provided by Morris.[7] King.com was founded in Sweden in 2003, and initially started with the development of browser-based video games. Morris served as Chairman, while Zacconi and Rowland were co-CEOs.[9]
Initially, King.com was not profitable, and nearly went bankrupt until a cash infusion from Morris on Christmas Eve of 2003 helped to finance the company.[4] By 2005, the company had been able to turn a profit.[4] During this year, the company raised $43 million by selling a large stake to Apax Partners and Index Ventures.[9] This investment was the last one that the company received before its initial public offering in 2014.[10] King.com continued to develop games for its web portal, which it would also share to other web portals like Yahoo![11] By 2009, the company was making about $60 million annually.[12] Rowland departed the company in 2008 to found Magnahigh, a web portal aimed for educational math games,[13] and sold his stake back to the company for $3 million in 2011.[8] Angel investor and former board member Klaus Hommels sold his similar stake at the same time.[9]
Transition to social gaming[edit]
Around 2009, social network games on Facebook began to gain popularity, led primarily through games developed by Zynga. King.com saw a significant drop in players on their portal games as a result, and started to develop their own Facebook-based games using the games already developed on the King.com portal, with their first such game released in 2010.[14] King.com used their web portal as a testing grounds for new game ideas and determine which ones to bring to Facebook, as well as determining how to implement various microtransactions for tournament-style play into the Facebook games.[15] Their first cross-platform web portal/Facebook game, Miner Speed, which allowed sharing of player information between platforms, was released in 2011, and was a simple match-3 tile game inspired by Bejeweled.[16] Following this model, in October 2011, the company released Bubble Witch Saga to both platforms. Bubble Witch Saga introduced the nature of a "saga" game, that instead of playing the same gameboard for as long as the player could continue to match matches, that instead the game offered individual levels that would challenge the player to complete certain goals in a limited number of turns. These saga elements allowed for the basics of social gameplay, but did not require the time investment that then-popular titles like Zynga's Farmville required; players could play just for a few minutes each day through the saga model.[17] The formula proved extremely successful, and January 2012, Bubble Witch Saga had over 10 million players and was one of the most-played Facebook games.[18] By April 2012, King.com had the second largest player count, around 30 million unique users,[9] second only to Zynga on the Facebook platform.[11][14] Facebook's director of games partnerships Sean Ryan described King.com's growth on the platform as "They were not a flash in the pan -- they've been around seven years. But they came out of no where in an area that was unexpected."[19] King.com next released Candy Crush Saga in April 2012, based on the popularity of its Candy Crush web-portal game and following the saga model from Bubble Witch Saga.[20] The game attracted more than 4 million players within a few weeks.[21]
The popularity of Bubble Witch Saga and Candy Crush Saga led King.com to start a new strategy into developing for the growing mobile game market, in a manner that would allow players to synchronize with the Facebook platform. Zacconi said that "As consumers and the industry focus more on games for mobile devices, launching a truly cross-platform Facebook game has been a top priority for King.com."[22] A mobile version for iOS device of Bubble Witch Saga was released in July 2012,[22] while the iOS mobile version of Candy Crush Saga was released in October 2012.[23] Both games saw boosts in the number of unique players with the mobile introduction; King.com saw that previously-declining player counts for Bubble Witch Saga become steady with the mobile version's release, while Candy Crush Saga saw more than 5.2 million unique players on Facebook in November 2012 and which were continuing to climb. Additionally, in-game advertising, which factored into about 15% of King.com's revenues, had increased ten-fold from 2011 into 2012.[24] Users jumped to 408 million by the end of 2013.[9] Revenues for King.com increased from a little over $62 million in 2011 to $1.88 billion in 2013.[9]
In March 2013, on the ten-year anniversary of the its founding, the company announced it was dropping the ".com" part of its branding and would continue on as just "King".[25]
Initial public offering[edit]
In mid-2013, King.com had considered filing an initial public offering (IPO) in the United States. Zacconi had said that "The IPO is an option...We are building the company and part of that is investigating options."[26]
The company applied for initial public offering (IPO) in September 2013. Its filing was made using allowances in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act to keep details of the IPO secret until it was to be offered. The IPO was backed by Bank of America, Merrill Lynch Corp, Credit Suisse Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co. The IPO gained great interest, as it followed Zynga's $1 billion IPO in 2011 and Twitter's IPO earlier in the month.[10]
King completed its on 26 March 2014. Priced at $22.50 a share, the middle of its projected price range, the IPO valued the company at US$7.08 billion. About $500 million was raised through the sale of 22.2 million shares. Of that, 15.3 million shares came from the company and the rest from Apax and other stakeholders. It was the largest ever IPO for a mobile/social gaming company in the US, narrowly eclipsing Zynga's 2011 offering.[4] To celebrate the debut, Candy Crush mascots took to the New York Stock Exchange.[8] Morris is the company's largest shareholder with approximately 35.6 million shares valued at $821 million.[7][8] The company began trading under the "KING" symbol on the New York Stock Exchange.[4]
Shares of King fell 15.6% on the first day of trading, closing at $19.[8] By June, the company's valuation had dropped by $2 billion, though otherwise was still profitable. Zacconi noted that their strategy from this point was not to find another "mega-hit" like Candy Crush Saga, but to "build a portfolio of games", carrying King's game design approach to other genres.[12] Revenue following the IPO were over $2.6 billion in 2014, with Candy Crush Saga generating nearly half of that amount.[27]
Subsidiary of Activision Blizzard (2015-present)[edit]
In November 2015, Activision Blizzard announced its plans to acquire King Digital Entertainment for $5.9 billion. Upon announcement of the news, USA Today reported that "the deal gives Activision immediate access to the growing mobile gaming audience, the fastest-rising sector in video games."[28] On 23 February 2016, Activision Blizzard closed its acquisition of King Digital Entertainment for a deal of $5.9 billion.[3] Activision Blizzard as a result operates the world's largest game network,[29] reaching around 500 million users[29] in 196 countries.[30] About the King acquisition, the CEO of Activision Blizzard explained that "we see great opportunities to create new ways for audiences to experience their favorite franchises, from Candy Crush to World of Warcraft to Call of Duty and more, across mobile devices, consoles and personal computers."[29]

Revenue model[edit]
King's games, prior to June 2013, made revenue for the company through a combination of in-game advertising and microtransactions. These microtransactions allow for players to use funds to purchase in-game booster items that could be used to help clear certain levels, additional lives, and immediate access to new levels instead of having to wait for a few days.
In June 2013, the company opted to remove all in-game advertising from their games, relying solely on microtransactions. The company stated that due to their "focus around delivering an uninterrupted entertainment experience for our network of loyal players across web, tablet and mobile has unfortunately led to the difficult decision of removing advertising as a core element of King's overall strategy".[31] Advertising revenue had only made up 10% of the company's earnings in 2012, and only 1% within 2013; the company in its IPO files stated they do not anticipate any further earnings from advertising revenue.[32] While King relies heavily on in-game purchases, it is estimated that only single-digit percentages of all players of their games have spent money on their titles. In Q4 2014, King had 356 million monthly unique users, with 8.3 million of them spending money. The 2.3% that pay spent an average of $23.42 a month within the games.[27] King stated that their model is aimed to continue to draw existing and new players to all of their games: "If the cost to acquire players is greater than the revenue we generate over time from those players and if we cannot successfully migrate our current players to new games and new platforms as we have historically done so, our business and operating results will be harmed".[32]
Games[edit]
King games offer synchronized play, enabling users to connect to their Facebook account whilst playing on their smartphone or tablet device. This means that the user's progress is updated across all platforms, allowing the player to switch from smartphone, to tablet, to Facebook without losing their progress in the game.[33][34] They also offer two of their games to connect to KakaoTalk in South Korea.
Bubble Witch Saga was King's first mobile game, released in July 2012 after its launch on Facebook in September 2011.[35][36] Bubble Witch Saga and its sequel Bubble Witch 2 Saga are versions of Puzzle Bobble.[37] Papa Pear Saga was released in March 2013 on Facebook, it is a Peggle variation.[38] Pepper Panic Saga was released in January 2014 as a matching game on Facebook.[39] It was ranked the 23rd most played game on Facebook in January 2014.[40] Around 2012, Pyramid Solitaire Saga was soft launched on Facebook. It was released on mobile in May 2014.[41] In late 2012 Pet Rescue Saga was launched on Facebook, then on iOS and Android In June 2013, Candy Crush Soda Saga was soft launched on Facebook and mobile[42] and Bubble Witch 2 Saga was widely released for Android and iOS devices.[43] In November 2014, Candy Crush Soda Saga was widely released on Android and iOS.[44] Alpha Betty Saga launched on Facebook in April 2015. This game is a variation of Bookworm.
In 2013, King acquired the Defold game engine, developed by Ragnar Svensson and Christian Murray in 2007 as a lightweight 2D game engine. The two had offered the engine to King as well as their services as contractors to support it, and later bought the engine, using it first for the game Blossom Blast Saga.[45] In March 2016, King released the Defold engine as a free development tool for any user.[46]
King announced in April 2017 that they will be developing a mobile Call of Duty game, a property owned by Activision; the game would be one of the first ones outside of the casual mobile space for the company.[47]
Candy Crush Saga[edit]

King's most popular game is Candy Crush Saga, which was launched on King's website in March 2011, which is a tile-matching game.[48] It launched on Facebook in April 2012 and quickly gained popularity.

The game was downloaded over 10 million times in its first month.[49][50] In January 2013, it became the number one most played game on Facebook.[2][51] It had over 45 million monthly users in March 2013.

Trademark and cloning disputes[edit]
In January 2014, King attracted controversy after attempting to trademark the words "Candy" and "Saga" in game titles.[58] This directly impacted Stoic's trademark request for The Banner Saga, to which King filed an opposition, calling the name "deceptively similar" to King games.[58] Stoic said that the dispute hindered work on a planned sequel to their game.[59] The developer Runsome Apps opposed King's trademark of the term "candy" on grounds of "likelihood of confusion", referencing its CandySwipe game, that was published two years before Candy Crush Saga. King subsequently contested the trademark of "CandySwipe". In February 2014, Runsome Apps ceased legal action and opposition towards King, while posting an open letter shaming King's business practices regarding trademarks.[60] On 17 April 2014, it was reported that King has settled its disputes with Stoic Studio and Runsome Apps.[61]
Also in January 2014, game developer Matthew Cox accused King of ripping off his game Scamperghost, saying King's Pac-Avoid was a clone of it. According to Cox, he was in talks with King about licensing Scamperghost, but when the deal fell through the company released the game Pac-Avoid. Cox said Epicshadows, the developer of Pac-Avoid, told him that King had approached them to "clone the game very quickly".[62] King removed the game from its website, but denied the cloning allegation, stating that they were removing the game "for the avoidance of doubt".[63] Later, in an official statement on the company's website, King stated: "The details of the situation are complex, but the bottom line is that we should never have published Pac-Avoid. We have taken the game down from our site, and we apologise for having published it in the first place. Let me be clear: This unfortunate situation is an exception to the rule. King does not clone games, and we do not want anyone cloning our games."[64]

Early life[edit]
Zacconi was born in 1968 in Rome, Italy. He attended Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli in Rome from where he graduated in 1993 with a Bachelor's degree in economics.[3][4]
Career[edit]
After leaving university, Zacconi worked as a consultant. One of his roles during this time included a six-year period as project manager at Boston Consulting Group, between 1993 and 1999. His first career role was as a consultant during a two year long stint at LEK consulting, between 1991 and 1993.[5][6][7]
At the start of the dotcom boom in 1999, Zacconi joined the Swedish online messaging startup Spray before it was purchased by Lycos Europe in 2000.[8][9]
In 2001, he left Spray and moved to the UK to become vice president of European sales and marketing at Terrence "Lee" Zehrer's uDate. He left this company shortly after its merger with Match.com and in March 2003, he co-founded King Digital Entertainment, becoming the CEO. He has since grown the company into one of the most successful mobile gaming businesses worldwide.[10][11]
Media profile[edit]
Zacconi is a leading figure in the UK tech industry and is a proponent of the UK government's efforts to establish a tech city in East London. According to an interview in the Daily Telegraph, he also has a positive reputation in San Francisco as a leading tech figure following a dinner with Mark Zuckerberg. He was reportedly identified as the posterchild for Europe's mobile gaming sector.[12] He was knighted by the Italian President in December 2016 with the title of Commendatore dell'Ordine della Stella d'Italia.[13]
Personal life[edit]
Zacconi is married with one son.[14]
