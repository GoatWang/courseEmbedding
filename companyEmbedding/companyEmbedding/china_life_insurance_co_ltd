Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

The information you provide is used only to verify your identity.  We do not maintain a record of the information reviewed while verifying your identity.

How does Prudential protect my personal information?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

How can I be sure my privacy is protected?

Prudential respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. Please select the Customer Privacy Notice button that appears on the bottom of this website's pages to view our privacy statement.

What is an eSignature?

Whenever you apply for a life insurance policy, you need to sign a few documents during the process. Since this process is over the Internet and you cannot physically sign the documents, we use electronic signature, or eSignature, to get your signature.

Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by Pruco Life Insurance Company, Newark, NJ.

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

Term Life Insurance
A Term Life policy offers coverage only if death occurs during a specific period of time, which coincides with the terms in which the insured member is required to make a monthly premium. A Term Life policy pays a benefit to the beneficiaries only if the policy holder dies during the time period for which the policy was initially contracted and has remained current on their annual or monthly premium payments.
This type of policy is beneficial for parents of young children, people with debt obligations and also home buyers. It can be renewed after the initial term has ended and it may also be converted to a whole life policy. The premiums are based on your age and your health status. Purchasing a new Term policy at the expiration of your existing policy will result in a higher premium and you may not qualify if you have disqualifying health issues.
Term Life is a "death benefit only" policy that you buy for a specified length of time. Think of it like leasing a car: you pay for the use of the car for a specified period and when the contract period is over, you return the car.
Term Life is referred to as "benefit only" insurance because unlike the various types of permanent life such as Whole Life, it carries no "cash surrender value". Because of this, Term Life insurance premiums tend to be very affordable. Young and relatively healthy individuals can often obtain a policy with limited or no medical background check. It is ideal for families that are just starting out, or for the family income provider who wants to make sure his or her family will be protected, but may not be able to afford, or desire a permanent life policy. However, understand that as a person ages over the period of the term, monthly premiums may increase.
It is often an ideal option to insure a second spouse, or for single people, even for children, just to make sure the often unexpectedly expensive costs of a funeral are covered. There are many insurance and financial professionals who suggest that those who purchase a Term Life policy can make up for the investment component of a Permanent Life insurance policy by investing the cost savings between the two on their own.
The earlier you purchase a term life policy and the healthier you are, the cheaper the premiums will be over the term of the policy.
Annual Renewable Term Life policies are those that are purchased year-by-year. The next year you do not have to prequalify. Simply choose to renew at what may or may not be an increased rate. Rates for Annual Renewable policies are at historic lows. A young healthy person can get $250,000.00 for only a few hundred dollars per year.
There are very good rates these days on Term Life. The premium is fixed and will not go up for the life of the term, usually 10,15, 20 or 30 years. It is not uncommon for a healthy non-smoking 40 year-old male to obtain a 20 or 30-year policy with a fixed premium of less than $30 per month.
So just how much Insurance should you buy? Many things factor into that answer, but at the minimum the experts say purchase enough insurance to equal at least 5-7 years of your present salary. If you have young children, make that around 10 years. So, if you make $50,000 a year that means at least $250,000 to $500,000 in coverage. Feel free to use our Life Insurance Calculator to help determine the right amount for your circumstances.
Term Life Insurance is an affordable life insurance product to ensure that your loved ones are protected in the event of your unexpected death, for a specific term period of time.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

Arbitration
All disputes arising out of or relating to any purchase you make with via this Site, any information you provide via the Site, these Terms (including the formation, performance or alleged breach), and your use of the Site will be exclusively resolved under confidential binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”) then in effect at the time of the dispute. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If you initiate arbitration, Healthplans.com will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA Rules once you have notified Healthplans.com in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings. However, if Healthplans.com is the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may allow the arbitrator to award attorneys’ fees and costs to Healthplans.com. If for any reason the AAA is unavailable, the parties shall mutually select another arbitration forum. The arbitration will be conducted in the city of Los Angeles, California, but may proceed telephonically if the claimant so chooses.
The arbitrator’s award will be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under these Terms may be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these Terms, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will have the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in state or federal court located to enforce these Terms or prevent an infringement of a third party’s rights.

The parties to this arbitration agreement acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Healthplans.com IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.
You shall have thirty (30) days from the date that you submit your personally identifiable information to opt-out of this arbitration agreement.

Affordable Life Insurance




				Are you searching for life insurance that fits within your budget? Are you afraid to purchase it because of the cost?        
				
Are you searching for life insurance that fits within your budget? Are you afraid to purchase it because of the cost? If you have procrastinated on purchasing life insurance because you think that you cannot afford it, you may be making a mistake. Everyone has everyday necessary expenses like food and shelter that are often dictated by a budget. A life insurance policy should be a priority among those expenses and it can be affordable. There are very few purchases as important as the security of your family, so how can you afford not to have life insurance? Taking the risk of not having life insurance places your loved ones in potential financial jeopardy.






What would happen to your family if you died unexpectedly? Your loved ones must continue their lives without your financial contribution while unpaid bills and unexpected final expenses begin to mount. Imagine the difficulties and disruption that would be forced upon your family. Would they be able to manage?
Purchasing life insurance can mean purchasing peace of mind. Instead of leaving a financial burden, you can rest assured knowing you will leave your loved ones prepared. You can also give them time to grieve without having to face the pressure of debt and difficult financial obligations. The purchase of an affordable life insurance policy can give your family the gift of security and protection, and in turn, give them time to grieve without unneeded pressure.
Death is a certainty, but a responsible investment like life insurance can be made to ensure families are protected from financial strain and worry. To keep your family financially secure, re-evaluate your budget priorities and move the purchase of a life insurance policy to the top. This is one expense your family cannot afford to be without.

China Life Insurance Company Limited (short China Life, Chinese: 中国人寿保险; pinyin: Zhōngguó rénshòu bǎoxiǎn) is a Beijing-based China-incorporated company that provides life insurance and annuity products. China Life is ranked No. 94 on Fortune 2015 Global 500 Company list. [2] China Life, which is 70% state-owned, is the biggest life insurer in China, but is coming off a few rocky years. China's insurance market attracted dozens of new competitors after the Chinese government liberalized it, and China Life's market share has fallen by almost half since 2007, from 50% to around 26%, according to Morningstar. The company is completing a major restructuring, and the government assigned it a new CEO in 2014. A new sales push early this year (fueled by an army of newly hired agents) led to a big bump in net income in the first quarter of 2015. China Life is also ranked on Fortune China: 2015 Top 500 Chinese Enterprises at No.13.
China Life has more than 600,000 agents nationwide, making its cost of acquiring new customers relatively low. China Life has a substantial share of China's group life and health insurance business, and its government ties give it an inroad to help it build that business among state-owned enterprises.[3]
In 2015 China's government allowed Chinese insurance companies to invest in foreign real estate; China Life subsequently made its first such investment, in a Boston waterfront project. [4]

China Life Insurance Company Limited is the largest life insurer in the People's Republic of China. The company offers individual life insurance, group life, accident insurance, and health insurance policies. China Life commands 45 percent of that market, and holds the number one position in 29 of the country's 31 major markets—only Shanghai and Beijing, where the company nonetheless is number two, escape its dominance. Formed from the breakup of former government-owned monopoly People's Insurance Company of China, China Life is the only life insurance company in China with a national operating license, which has permitted it to develop a network of more than 8,000 field offices, 4,800 branch offices, 3,000 customer service offices, and 87,000 sales outlets in such locations as banks, post offices, hotels, airports, travel agents, and the like. The company's nearly 67,000 employees are complemented by a network of 650,000 exclusive independent sales agents. The company also operates a "one-stop" 24-hour telephone sales and service hotline. Together, China Life serves more than 100 million long-term policy holders and more than 150 million short-term policy holders, generating nearly CNY 51 billion ($6.2 billion) in net premiums and policy fees in 2003. The group's total sales topped $9.5 billion that year. China Life listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange at the end of 2003, raising $3.5 billion in that year's largest initial public offering (IPO). China has indicated its intention to expand into other financial areas, such as asset management, brokering, and banking.
Inheriting China's Pre-Revolution Insurance Industry The opening of China to the West in the early years of the 20th century led to a variety of new business opportunities. By the end of World War I, China, and especially Shanghai, had become a major center for international trade, although dominated by foreign interests. The lively commercial market in that city offered entrepreneurs seemingly unlimited potential; among these was the young C.V. Starr, an American, who founded an insurance agent's office in Shanghai in 1919. At first, Starr's company, American Asiatic Underwriters (AAU), served as a local representative for foreign insurers.
AAU originally dealt in fire and marine insurance policies. In the early 1920s, however, Starr recognized the vast potential for life insurance among the country's Chinese population. Starr set up a new company, Asia Life Insurance Company, which became the first to market life insurance products to the Chinese. The company's head start allowed it to build quickly into a leading insurance provider not only across the Chinese mainland, but throughout much of the Asian region. Starr's company eventually evolved into U.S. leader American Insurance Group. In the meantime, Asia Life's success inspired a raft of competitors. Most of these were local representatives of large foreign companies. A number of local groups appeared, however, and played an important role in developing the life insurance market among the indigenous population.
One of the earliest and most important of these companies was the Tai Ping Insurance Company, which was incorporated in Shanghai in 1929. Founded by Mr. H.N. Ting (Ting Hsieh Nung) with the help from the Chin Chen Bank Shanghai, the new company received start-up investments from a number of Chinese banks and began issuing general insurance policies. The following year, Tai Ping added a life insurance component, Tai Ping Life Insurance Company. Tai Ping developed strongly through the 1930s, adding nearly 20 branches in major cities in China as well as elsewhere in southeast Asia. The company also opened some 400 secondary offices across the Chinese mainland, before adding representative offices in Europe and in the Americas.
By the mid-1930s, Tai Ping had grown sufficiently large to become a member of the Shanghai Insurance Association, the only Chinese-owned company to be included in what had previously been an exclusive club for foreign insurers. Tai Ping's fortunes began to dwindle after the start of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and especially with the Mao-led Communist revolution in 1949.
Tai Ping in the meantime had been joined by a growing number of other Chinese-owned insurance companies. Among these were China Insurance Company, founded in 1931 in Shanghai, which opened a life insurance subsidiary, China Life Insurance Company in 1933. Later insurance market entries included Ming An Insurance Company, established in Hong Kong in 1949. By then, China boasted more than 240 insurance companies—some 180 of which were Chinese owned.
Following the revolution, the Mao government set up the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), which took over all insurance interests on the mainland. Tai Ping's leadership fled to Taiwan in 1950, reestablishing the company's operations there. Other companies, especially those that had set up foreign branches in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Saigon and elsewhere, withdrew from the mainland to rebuild their businesses around their foreign holdings. Foreign insurance companies were simply expelled outright, and their holdings regrouped under PICC as well.
At first the PICC monopoly continued to operate its various insurance services, integrating the assets of the former independent insurance sector. By 1952, PICC represented a national network of 1,300 branches and 3,000 agency outlets. Yet the Chinese government, in its effort to develop its regime, determined that insurance was superfluous in a state where the government was meant to provide for all social welfare for its citizens. In 1959, therefore, all domestic insurance business was ended. PICC's role was reduced to providing insurance covering the country's foreign policy needs, such as for the marine and aviation sectors. Following the reform, PICC was converted into a department of the government's central bank.
Reforming in the 1980s Economic reforms launched under Deng Xiaoping in 1978 paved the way to a rebirth in China's insurance sector. In 1979, the People's Insurance Company of China was separated from the central bank and reestablished as an independently operating, although state-controlled, company. In that year, PICC began offering general (i.e., non-life) insurance policies. In 1980, as the first initiatives to bring foreign investment capital in the country emerged, PICC formed a joint venture with American Insurance Group—allowing the American company to test the waters before making a broader return to the mainland insurance market in the 1990s.
PICC began offering life insurance policies again in 1982, targeting the small but growing numbers of middle-class and wealthy Chinese, as well as government officials. Nonetheless, the Chinese life insurance market remained tiny—as late as 2004, per capita spending on life insurance amounted to the equivalent of just $28, compared with average per capita spending of as much $2,800 or more in Japan, offering tantalizing prospects for future growth.
PICC officially retained its monopoly on the Chinese insurance market into the late 1980s. In 1988, however, the company's monopoly was abolished. Licenses were granted to the company's first competitors, including Ping An, which, established that year, grew into the country's second largest life insurer, with a dominance in the important Beijing market. Other early domestic competitors included China Pacific, based in Shanghai, which also started business in 1988, and American Insurance Group, which, in 1992, became the first foreign company to be granted a license to operate a self-standing business on the mainland (i.e., not as part of a joint venture with a local partner). Nonetheless, PICC remained the clear insurance champion on the mainland, with a strong national presence. The company also began opening offices overseas, adding locations in Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and London.
Public Company for the New Century The Chinese government began a wider opening of the country's insurance market in the early 1990s. By the end of the decade, the government had granted licenses to a total of 16 companies—including such returning groups as Tai Ping Insurance Company and China Insurance Company. The increasingly competitive environment led to a need to change PICC's structure. In 1996, the company reorganized as a holding company, called PICC Group. Its operations were then broken up into three subsidiaries, PICC Life, PICC Property, and PICC Reinsurance. PICC Group initially operated under the control of the People's Bank of China.
Despite the restructuring, PICC Group was somewhat hampered in its growth. The arrival of AIG had introduced a new tied-agency system into the market, encouraging the development of branch networks. Yet PICC Group, as a state-owned enterprise, was initially barred from developing its own network of branch offices and tied agents. As a result, the company was forced to cede the leadership spot in two of the country's most important markets, Beijing, captured by Ping An, and Shanghai, taken by China Pacific.
In 1998, the Chinese government transferred oversight of the country's growing insurance market to a new body, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC). Under new rules, insurance companies were prohibited from operating in both the non-life and life insurance markets. As a result, PICC Group was broken up into its four primary components: PICC, which took over the company's general insurance business; China Re, for its reinsurance operations; China Insurance, which handled the group's international activities; and China Life. All four companies remained controlled by the Chinese state.
Yet the former members of PICC Group began moving toward an opening of its share capital at the beginning of the 2000s. In 2000, China Life announced its intention to diversify its own shareholding in advance of a future public offering. In the meantime, the company continued to build up its business across China, solidifying its dominant position in 29 of the country's 30 major markets. China Life also was helped by the government's rule for foreign corporations operating in China, which stipulated that all employees in these companies must be covered by unified insurance policies. In response, China Life concentrated its unified insurance operations at its Guangdong Branch, close to the rapidly expanding free-trade zone, in which the majority of foreign enterprises had set up their Chinese operations. By 2001, China Life had captured 80 percent of the unified insurance business for the top 500 foreign firms operating in China.
China Life then began petitioning the CIRC for authorization to go public, which was granted in June 2003. As part of the run up to the company's IPO, China Life restructured its operations, splitting into three entities: China Life Insurance Company and China Life Asset Management Company, both of which were placed under a new holding company, China Life Insurance Corporation.
In order to make its IPO more attractive, the parent holding transferred only long- and medium-term policies issued on or after June 10, 1999, to China Life. This move was made in order to avoid launching China Life with the burden of a large number of loss-making policies issued at return rates as high as 6.5 percent. The June 10, 1999 date corresponded to an emergency ruling by the CIRC, which lowered return rates to just 2.5 percent.
To attract as wide a pool of investors as possible, China Life launched its IPO on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange in December 2003. The IPO was a huge success, raising $3.5 billion and becoming the world's largest for that year. The retail offer had been oversubscribed by 172 times, and the total order had reached $80 billion.
The success of its IPO encouraged China Life to begin eyeing expansion into new markets in 2004. China Life's unlisted parent company announced its intention to diversify its insurance business to include property insurance and develop an insurance intermediary agent business as well as add other financial services. China Life itself announced its intention to diversify into new services, such as asset management, brokerage services, and banking in the near future. In the meantime, China Life had emerged as the dominant player in what many expected to become the world's fastest-growing and largest life insurance market.
Principal Competitors: Ping An Insurance Company Ltd.; China Pacific Insurance Company Ltd.; AIG; AIU Insurance Co.; Allianz Dazhong Life Insurance Company Ltd.; Chubb Group of Insurance Cos.; Cigna Corporation; Manulife-Sinochem Life Insurance Company Ltd.[5]
It became a public-listed company on December 18, 2003, with a market capitalization of US$5,756 million as of August 31, 2005. ¥832.5Billion was frozen during the IPO. The domestic listing, the first by an insurer in China, drew bids for about 49 times the stock on offer. The gains allow China Life to pass ING Group NV, Allianz SE and Axa to become the world's no. 2 insurer with a market value of $129 billion, behind American International Group's $186 billion. China Life is also listed in China since Jan of 2007.
In 2006, the new Executive Board put forward the conglomeration strategy of “being exceptionally strong in core businesses and appropriately diversified in operation”. At the end of 2006, China Life Property & Casualty Insurance Company Limited and China Life Pension Company Limited were successively established. Meanwhile, restructuring was basically accomplished on China Life Insurance (Overseas) Company Limited, China Life Investment Holding Company Limited and Insurance Professional College. By then, a group layout took initial shape through integration of life insurance, property & casualty insurance, corporate annuity, capital management, industrial investment and insurance education.
On January 9, 2007, the Life Company returned successfully to China A share market in Shanghai, thus making itself China's only financial insurer triple-listed home and abroad. With such unchallenged position, China Life further defined its goal to build itself into a world-class financial and insurance group by implementing the conglomeration strategy of “being exceptionally strong in core businesses and appropriately diversified in operation”. To realize the goal, China Life clarified a scientific roadmap with its own characteristics, and put forward the strategic requirements of comprehensively enhancing integrated operation and management capability. China Life has strived to make itself even bigger, stronger and better in a more appropriate and faster way. [6]
There is no business relationship between China Life Insurance Company in Mainland China and Taiwan.
3.02 billion yuan in illegal activities[edit]
China's audit office said it uncovered "improper and illegal activities" involving 3.02 billion yuan at two of the country's largest insurers, People's Insurance Co. of China Ltd. and China Life Insurance Co., during an audit of their 2009 books. They are charged with offences including the illegal sale of policies, overstating policy sales, improper claim settlements, illegal distributions of commissions and "grey income" - off-the-books gains, some of which company officials pocketed among themselves.
These violations have raised concern amongst some Chinese citizens over the authenticity and legality of the policies they currently hold. They are worried about where their money is going and what it is being used for. Without transparency, trust is quickly evaporating from businesses that are found to be conducting shady business.[7]

China Life Insurance Company Limited (short China Life, Chinese: 中国人寿保险; pinyin: Zhōngguó rénshòu bǎoxiǎn) is a Beijing-based China-incorporated company that provides life insurance and annuity products. China Life is ranked No. 94 on Fortune 2015 Global 500 Company list. [2] China Life, which is 70% state-owned, is the biggest life insurer in China, but is coming off a few rocky years. China's insurance market attracted dozens of new competitors after the Chinese government liberalized it, and China Life's market share has fallen by almost half since 2007, from 50% to around 26%, according to Morningstar. The company is completing a major restructuring, and the government assigned it a new CEO in 2014. A new sales push early this year (fueled by an army of newly hired agents) led to a big bump in net income in the first quarter of 2015. China Life is also ranked on Fortune China: 2015 Top 500 Chinese Enterprises at No.13.
China Life has more than 600,000 agents nationwide, making its cost of acquiring new customers relatively low. China Life has a substantial share of China's group life and health insurance business, and its government ties give it an inroad to help it build that business among state-owned enterprises.[3]
In 2015 China's government allowed Chinese insurance companies to invest in foreign real estate; China Life subsequently made its first such investment, in a Boston waterfront project. [4]

China Life Insurance Company Limited is the largest life insurer in the People's Republic of China. The company offers individual life insurance, group life, accident insurance, and health insurance policies. China Life commands 45 percent of that market, and holds the number one position in 29 of the country's 31 major markets—only Shanghai and Beijing, where the company nonetheless is number two, escape its dominance. Formed from the breakup of former government-owned monopoly People's Insurance Company of China, China Life is the only life insurance company in China with a national operating license, which has permitted it to develop a network of more than 8,000 field offices, 4,800 branch offices, 3,000 customer service offices, and 87,000 sales outlets in such locations as banks, post offices, hotels, airports, travel agents, and the like. The company's nearly 67,000 employees are complemented by a network of 650,000 exclusive independent sales agents. The company also operates a "one-stop" 24-hour telephone sales and service hotline. Together, China Life serves more than 100 million long-term policy holders and more than 150 million short-term policy holders, generating nearly CNY 51 billion ($6.2 billion) in net premiums and policy fees in 2003. The group's total sales topped $9.5 billion that year. China Life listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange at the end of 2003, raising $3.5 billion in that year's largest initial public offering (IPO). China has indicated its intention to expand into other financial areas, such as asset management, brokering, and banking.
Inheriting China's Pre-Revolution Insurance Industry The opening of China to the West in the early years of the 20th century led to a variety of new business opportunities. By the end of World War I, China, and especially Shanghai, had become a major center for international trade, although dominated by foreign interests. The lively commercial market in that city offered entrepreneurs seemingly unlimited potential; among these was the young C.V. Starr, an American, who founded an insurance agent's office in Shanghai in 1919. At first, Starr's company, American Asiatic Underwriters (AAU), served as a local representative for foreign insurers.
AAU originally dealt in fire and marine insurance policies. In the early 1920s, however, Starr recognized the vast potential for life insurance among the country's Chinese population. Starr set up a new company, Asia Life Insurance Company, which became the first to market life insurance products to the Chinese. The company's head start allowed it to build quickly into a leading insurance provider not only across the Chinese mainland, but throughout much of the Asian region. Starr's company eventually evolved into U.S. leader American Insurance Group. In the meantime, Asia Life's success inspired a raft of competitors. Most of these were local representatives of large foreign companies. A number of local groups appeared, however, and played an important role in developing the life insurance market among the indigenous population.
One of the earliest and most important of these companies was the Tai Ping Insurance Company, which was incorporated in Shanghai in 1929. Founded by Mr. H.N. Ting (Ting Hsieh Nung) with the help from the Chin Chen Bank Shanghai, the new company received start-up investments from a number of Chinese banks and began issuing general insurance policies. The following year, Tai Ping added a life insurance component, Tai Ping Life Insurance Company. Tai Ping developed strongly through the 1930s, adding nearly 20 branches in major cities in China as well as elsewhere in southeast Asia. The company also opened some 400 secondary offices across the Chinese mainland, before adding representative offices in Europe and in the Americas.
By the mid-1930s, Tai Ping had grown sufficiently large to become a member of the Shanghai Insurance Association, the only Chinese-owned company to be included in what had previously been an exclusive club for foreign insurers. Tai Ping's fortunes began to dwindle after the start of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and especially with the Mao-led Communist revolution in 1949.
Tai Ping in the meantime had been joined by a growing number of other Chinese-owned insurance companies. Among these were China Insurance Company, founded in 1931 in Shanghai, which opened a life insurance subsidiary, China Life Insurance Company in 1933. Later insurance market entries included Ming An Insurance Company, established in Hong Kong in 1949. By then, China boasted more than 240 insurance companies—some 180 of which were Chinese owned.
Following the revolution, the Mao government set up the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), which took over all insurance interests on the mainland. Tai Ping's leadership fled to Taiwan in 1950, reestablishing the company's operations there. Other companies, especially those that had set up foreign branches in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Saigon and elsewhere, withdrew from the mainland to rebuild their businesses around their foreign holdings. Foreign insurance companies were simply expelled outright, and their holdings regrouped under PICC as well.
At first the PICC monopoly continued to operate its various insurance services, integrating the assets of the former independent insurance sector. By 1952, PICC represented a national network of 1,300 branches and 3,000 agency outlets. Yet the Chinese government, in its effort to develop its regime, determined that insurance was superfluous in a state where the government was meant to provide for all social welfare for its citizens. In 1959, therefore, all domestic insurance business was ended. PICC's role was reduced to providing insurance covering the country's foreign policy needs, such as for the marine and aviation sectors. Following the reform, PICC was converted into a department of the government's central bank.
Reforming in the 1980s Economic reforms launched under Deng Xiaoping in 1978 paved the way to a rebirth in China's insurance sector. In 1979, the People's Insurance Company of China was separated from the central bank and reestablished as an independently operating, although state-controlled, company. In that year, PICC began offering general (i.e., non-life) insurance policies. In 1980, as the first initiatives to bring foreign investment capital in the country emerged, PICC formed a joint venture with American Insurance Group—allowing the American company to test the waters before making a broader return to the mainland insurance market in the 1990s.
PICC began offering life insurance policies again in 1982, targeting the small but growing numbers of middle-class and wealthy Chinese, as well as government officials. Nonetheless, the Chinese life insurance market remained tiny—as late as 2004, per capita spending on life insurance amounted to the equivalent of just $28, compared with average per capita spending of as much $2,800 or more in Japan, offering tantalizing prospects for future growth.
PICC officially retained its monopoly on the Chinese insurance market into the late 1980s. In 1988, however, the company's monopoly was abolished. Licenses were granted to the company's first competitors, including Ping An, which, established that year, grew into the country's second largest life insurer, with a dominance in the important Beijing market. Other early domestic competitors included China Pacific, based in Shanghai, which also started business in 1988, and American Insurance Group, which, in 1992, became the first foreign company to be granted a license to operate a self-standing business on the mainland (i.e., not as part of a joint venture with a local partner). Nonetheless, PICC remained the clear insurance champion on the mainland, with a strong national presence. The company also began opening offices overseas, adding locations in Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and London.
Public Company for the New Century The Chinese government began a wider opening of the country's insurance market in the early 1990s. By the end of the decade, the government had granted licenses to a total of 16 companies—including such returning groups as Tai Ping Insurance Company and China Insurance Company. The increasingly competitive environment led to a need to change PICC's structure. In 1996, the company reorganized as a holding company, called PICC Group. Its operations were then broken up into three subsidiaries, PICC Life, PICC Property, and PICC Reinsurance. PICC Group initially operated under the control of the People's Bank of China.
Despite the restructuring, PICC Group was somewhat hampered in its growth. The arrival of AIG had introduced a new tied-agency system into the market, encouraging the development of branch networks. Yet PICC Group, as a state-owned enterprise, was initially barred from developing its own network of branch offices and tied agents. As a result, the company was forced to cede the leadership spot in two of the country's most important markets, Beijing, captured by Ping An, and Shanghai, taken by China Pacific.
In 1998, the Chinese government transferred oversight of the country's growing insurance market to a new body, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC). Under new rules, insurance companies were prohibited from operating in both the non-life and life insurance markets. As a result, PICC Group was broken up into its four primary components: PICC, which took over the company's general insurance business; China Re, for its reinsurance operations; China Insurance, which handled the group's international activities; and China Life. All four companies remained controlled by the Chinese state.
Yet the former members of PICC Group began moving toward an opening of its share capital at the beginning of the 2000s. In 2000, China Life announced its intention to diversify its own shareholding in advance of a future public offering. In the meantime, the company continued to build up its business across China, solidifying its dominant position in 29 of the country's 30 major markets. China Life also was helped by the government's rule for foreign corporations operating in China, which stipulated that all employees in these companies must be covered by unified insurance policies. In response, China Life concentrated its unified insurance operations at its Guangdong Branch, close to the rapidly expanding free-trade zone, in which the majority of foreign enterprises had set up their Chinese operations. By 2001, China Life had captured 80 percent of the unified insurance business for the top 500 foreign firms operating in China.
China Life then began petitioning the CIRC for authorization to go public, which was granted in June 2003. As part of the run up to the company's IPO, China Life restructured its operations, splitting into three entities: China Life Insurance Company and China Life Asset Management Company, both of which were placed under a new holding company, China Life Insurance Corporation.
In order to make its IPO more attractive, the parent holding transferred only long- and medium-term policies issued on or after June 10, 1999, to China Life. This move was made in order to avoid launching China Life with the burden of a large number of loss-making policies issued at return rates as high as 6.5 percent. The June 10, 1999 date corresponded to an emergency ruling by the CIRC, which lowered return rates to just 2.5 percent.
To attract as wide a pool of investors as possible, China Life launched its IPO on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange in December 2003. The IPO was a huge success, raising $3.5 billion and becoming the world's largest for that year. The retail offer had been oversubscribed by 172 times, and the total order had reached $80 billion.
The success of its IPO encouraged China Life to begin eyeing expansion into new markets in 2004. China Life's unlisted parent company announced its intention to diversify its insurance business to include property insurance and develop an insurance intermediary agent business as well as add other financial services. China Life itself announced its intention to diversify into new services, such as asset management, brokerage services, and banking in the near future. In the meantime, China Life had emerged as the dominant player in what many expected to become the world's fastest-growing and largest life insurance market.
Principal Competitors: Ping An Insurance Company Ltd.; China Pacific Insurance Company Ltd.; AIG; AIU Insurance Co.; Allianz Dazhong Life Insurance Company Ltd.; Chubb Group of Insurance Cos.; Cigna Corporation; Manulife-Sinochem Life Insurance Company Ltd.[5]
It became a public-listed company on December 18, 2003, with a market capitalization of US$5,756 million as of August 31, 2005. ¥832.5Billion was frozen during the IPO. The domestic listing, the first by an insurer in China, drew bids for about 49 times the stock on offer. The gains allow China Life to pass ING Group NV, Allianz SE and Axa to become the world's no. 2 insurer with a market value of $129 billion, behind American International Group's $186 billion. China Life is also listed in China since Jan of 2007.
In 2006, the new Executive Board put forward the conglomeration strategy of “being exceptionally strong in core businesses and appropriately diversified in operation”. At the end of 2006, China Life Property & Casualty Insurance Company Limited and China Life Pension Company Limited were successively established. Meanwhile, restructuring was basically accomplished on China Life Insurance (Overseas) Company Limited, China Life Investment Holding Company Limited and Insurance Professional College. By then, a group layout took initial shape through integration of life insurance, property & casualty insurance, corporate annuity, capital management, industrial investment and insurance education.
On January 9, 2007, the Life Company returned successfully to China A share market in Shanghai, thus making itself China's only financial insurer triple-listed home and abroad. With such unchallenged position, China Life further defined its goal to build itself into a world-class financial and insurance group by implementing the conglomeration strategy of “being exceptionally strong in core businesses and appropriately diversified in operation”. To realize the goal, China Life clarified a scientific roadmap with its own characteristics, and put forward the strategic requirements of comprehensively enhancing integrated operation and management capability. China Life has strived to make itself even bigger, stronger and better in a more appropriate and faster way. [6]
There is no business relationship between China Life Insurance Company in Mainland China and Taiwan.
3.02 billion yuan in illegal activities[edit]
China's audit office said it uncovered "improper and illegal activities" involving 3.02 billion yuan at two of the country's largest insurers, People's Insurance Co. of China Ltd. and China Life Insurance Co., during an audit of their 2009 books. They are charged with offences including the illegal sale of policies, overstating policy sales, improper claim settlements, illegal distributions of commissions and "grey income" - off-the-books gains, some of which company officials pocketed among themselves.
These violations have raised concern amongst some Chinese citizens over the authenticity and legality of the policies they currently hold. They are worried about where their money is going and what it is being used for. Without transparency, trust is quickly evaporating from businesses that are found to be conducting shady business.[7]

China Life Insurance Company Limited (short China Life, Chinese: 中国人寿保险; pinyin: Zhōngguó rénshòu bǎoxiǎn) is a Beijing-based China-incorporated company that provides life insurance and annuity products. China Life is ranked No. 94 on Fortune 2015 Global 500 Company list. [2] China Life, which is 70% state-owned, is the biggest life insurer in China, but is coming off a few rocky years. China's insurance market attracted dozens of new competitors after the Chinese government liberalized it, and China Life's market share has fallen by almost half since 2007, from 50% to around 26%, according to Morningstar. The company is completing a major restructuring, and the government assigned it a new CEO in 2014. A new sales push early this year (fueled by an army of newly hired agents) led to a big bump in net income in the first quarter of 2015. China Life is also ranked on Fortune China: 2015 Top 500 Chinese Enterprises at No.13.
China Life has more than 600,000 agents nationwide, making its cost of acquiring new customers relatively low. China Life has a substantial share of China's group life and health insurance business, and its government ties give it an inroad to help it build that business among state-owned enterprises.[3]
In 2015 China's government allowed Chinese insurance companies to invest in foreign real estate; China Life subsequently made its first such investment, in a Boston waterfront project. [4]

China Life Insurance Company Limited is the largest life insurer in the People's Republic of China. The company offers individual life insurance, group life, accident insurance, and health insurance policies. China Life commands 45 percent of that market, and holds the number one position in 29 of the country's 31 major markets—only Shanghai and Beijing, where the company nonetheless is number two, escape its dominance. Formed from the breakup of former government-owned monopoly People's Insurance Company of China, China Life is the only life insurance company in China with a national operating license, which has permitted it to develop a network of more than 8,000 field offices, 4,800 branch offices, 3,000 customer service offices, and 87,000 sales outlets in such locations as banks, post offices, hotels, airports, travel agents, and the like. The company's nearly 67,000 employees are complemented by a network of 650,000 exclusive independent sales agents. The company also operates a "one-stop" 24-hour telephone sales and service hotline. Together, China Life serves more than 100 million long-term policy holders and more than 150 million short-term policy holders, generating nearly CNY 51 billion ($6.2 billion) in net premiums and policy fees in 2003. The group's total sales topped $9.5 billion that year. China Life listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange at the end of 2003, raising $3.5 billion in that year's largest initial public offering (IPO). China has indicated its intention to expand into other financial areas, such as asset management, brokering, and banking.
Inheriting China's Pre-Revolution Insurance Industry The opening of China to the West in the early years of the 20th century led to a variety of new business opportunities. By the end of World War I, China, and especially Shanghai, had become a major center for international trade, although dominated by foreign interests. The lively commercial market in that city offered entrepreneurs seemingly unlimited potential; among these was the young C.V. Starr, an American, who founded an insurance agent's office in Shanghai in 1919. At first, Starr's company, American Asiatic Underwriters (AAU), served as a local representative for foreign insurers.
AAU originally dealt in fire and marine insurance policies. In the early 1920s, however, Starr recognized the vast potential for life insurance among the country's Chinese population. Starr set up a new company, Asia Life Insurance Company, which became the first to market life insurance products to the Chinese. The company's head start allowed it to build quickly into a leading insurance provider not only across the Chinese mainland, but throughout much of the Asian region. Starr's company eventually evolved into U.S. leader American Insurance Group. In the meantime, Asia Life's success inspired a raft of competitors. Most of these were local representatives of large foreign companies. A number of local groups appeared, however, and played an important role in developing the life insurance market among the indigenous population.
One of the earliest and most important of these companies was the Tai Ping Insurance Company, which was incorporated in Shanghai in 1929. Founded by Mr. H.N. Ting (Ting Hsieh Nung) with the help from the Chin Chen Bank Shanghai, the new company received start-up investments from a number of Chinese banks and began issuing general insurance policies. The following year, Tai Ping added a life insurance component, Tai Ping Life Insurance Company. Tai Ping developed strongly through the 1930s, adding nearly 20 branches in major cities in China as well as elsewhere in southeast Asia. The company also opened some 400 secondary offices across the Chinese mainland, before adding representative offices in Europe and in the Americas.
By the mid-1930s, Tai Ping had grown sufficiently large to become a member of the Shanghai Insurance Association, the only Chinese-owned company to be included in what had previously been an exclusive club for foreign insurers. Tai Ping's fortunes began to dwindle after the start of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and especially with the Mao-led Communist revolution in 1949.
Tai Ping in the meantime had been joined by a growing number of other Chinese-owned insurance companies. Among these were China Insurance Company, founded in 1931 in Shanghai, which opened a life insurance subsidiary, China Life Insurance Company in 1933. Later insurance market entries included Ming An Insurance Company, established in Hong Kong in 1949. By then, China boasted more than 240 insurance companies—some 180 of which were Chinese owned.
Following the revolution, the Mao government set up the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), which took over all insurance interests on the mainland. Tai Ping's leadership fled to Taiwan in 1950, reestablishing the company's operations there. Other companies, especially those that had set up foreign branches in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Saigon and elsewhere, withdrew from the mainland to rebuild their businesses around their foreign holdings. Foreign insurance companies were simply expelled outright, and their holdings regrouped under PICC as well.
At first the PICC monopoly continued to operate its various insurance services, integrating the assets of the former independent insurance sector. By 1952, PICC represented a national network of 1,300 branches and 3,000 agency outlets. Yet the Chinese government, in its effort to develop its regime, determined that insurance was superfluous in a state where the government was meant to provide for all social welfare for its citizens. In 1959, therefore, all domestic insurance business was ended. PICC's role was reduced to providing insurance covering the country's foreign policy needs, such as for the marine and aviation sectors. Following the reform, PICC was converted into a department of the government's central bank.
Reforming in the 1980s Economic reforms launched under Deng Xiaoping in 1978 paved the way to a rebirth in China's insurance sector. In 1979, the People's Insurance Company of China was separated from the central bank and reestablished as an independently operating, although state-controlled, company. In that year, PICC began offering general (i.e., non-life) insurance policies. In 1980, as the first initiatives to bring foreign investment capital in the country emerged, PICC formed a joint venture with American Insurance Group—allowing the American company to test the waters before making a broader return to the mainland insurance market in the 1990s.
PICC began offering life insurance policies again in 1982, targeting the small but growing numbers of middle-class and wealthy Chinese, as well as government officials. Nonetheless, the Chinese life insurance market remained tiny—as late as 2004, per capita spending on life insurance amounted to the equivalent of just $28, compared with average per capita spending of as much $2,800 or more in Japan, offering tantalizing prospects for future growth.
PICC officially retained its monopoly on the Chinese insurance market into the late 1980s. In 1988, however, the company's monopoly was abolished. Licenses were granted to the company's first competitors, including Ping An, which, established that year, grew into the country's second largest life insurer, with a dominance in the important Beijing market. Other early domestic competitors included China Pacific, based in Shanghai, which also started business in 1988, and American Insurance Group, which, in 1992, became the first foreign company to be granted a license to operate a self-standing business on the mainland (i.e., not as part of a joint venture with a local partner). Nonetheless, PICC remained the clear insurance champion on the mainland, with a strong national presence. The company also began opening offices overseas, adding locations in Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and London.
Public Company for the New Century The Chinese government began a wider opening of the country's insurance market in the early 1990s. By the end of the decade, the government had granted licenses to a total of 16 companies—including such returning groups as Tai Ping Insurance Company and China Insurance Company. The increasingly competitive environment led to a need to change PICC's structure. In 1996, the company reorganized as a holding company, called PICC Group. Its operations were then broken up into three subsidiaries, PICC Life, PICC Property, and PICC Reinsurance. PICC Group initially operated under the control of the People's Bank of China.
Despite the restructuring, PICC Group was somewhat hampered in its growth. The arrival of AIG had introduced a new tied-agency system into the market, encouraging the development of branch networks. Yet PICC Group, as a state-owned enterprise, was initially barred from developing its own network of branch offices and tied agents. As a result, the company was forced to cede the leadership spot in two of the country's most important markets, Beijing, captured by Ping An, and Shanghai, taken by China Pacific.
In 1998, the Chinese government transferred oversight of the country's growing insurance market to a new body, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC). Under new rules, insurance companies were prohibited from operating in both the non-life and life insurance markets. As a result, PICC Group was broken up into its four primary components: PICC, which took over the company's general insurance business; China Re, for its reinsurance operations; China Insurance, which handled the group's international activities; and China Life. All four companies remained controlled by the Chinese state.
Yet the former members of PICC Group began moving toward an opening of its share capital at the beginning of the 2000s. In 2000, China Life announced its intention to diversify its own shareholding in advance of a future public offering. In the meantime, the company continued to build up its business across China, solidifying its dominant position in 29 of the country's 30 major markets. China Life also was helped by the government's rule for foreign corporations operating in China, which stipulated that all employees in these companies must be covered by unified insurance policies. In response, China Life concentrated its unified insurance operations at its Guangdong Branch, close to the rapidly expanding free-trade zone, in which the majority of foreign enterprises had set up their Chinese operations. By 2001, China Life had captured 80 percent of the unified insurance business for the top 500 foreign firms operating in China.
China Life then began petitioning the CIRC for authorization to go public, which was granted in June 2003. As part of the run up to the company's IPO, China Life restructured its operations, splitting into three entities: China Life Insurance Company and China Life Asset Management Company, both of which were placed under a new holding company, China Life Insurance Corporation.
In order to make its IPO more attractive, the parent holding transferred only long- and medium-term policies issued on or after June 10, 1999, to China Life. This move was made in order to avoid launching China Life with the burden of a large number of loss-making policies issued at return rates as high as 6.5 percent. The June 10, 1999 date corresponded to an emergency ruling by the CIRC, which lowered return rates to just 2.5 percent.
To attract as wide a pool of investors as possible, China Life launched its IPO on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange in December 2003. The IPO was a huge success, raising $3.5 billion and becoming the world's largest for that year. The retail offer had been oversubscribed by 172 times, and the total order had reached $80 billion.
The success of its IPO encouraged China Life to begin eyeing expansion into new markets in 2004. China Life's unlisted parent company announced its intention to diversify its insurance business to include property insurance and develop an insurance intermediary agent business as well as add other financial services. China Life itself announced its intention to diversify into new services, such as asset management, brokerage services, and banking in the near future. In the meantime, China Life had emerged as the dominant player in what many expected to become the world's fastest-growing and largest life insurance market.

It became a public-listed company on December 18, 2003, with a market capitalization of US$5,756 million as of August 31, 2005. ¥832.5Billion was frozen during the IPO. The domestic listing, the first by an insurer in China, drew bids for about 49 times the stock on offer. The gains allow China Life to pass ING Group NV, Allianz SE and Axa to become the world's no. 2 insurer with a market value of $129 billion, behind American International Group's $186 billion. China Life is also listed in China since Jan of 2007.
In 2006, the new Executive Board put forward the conglomeration strategy of “being exceptionally strong in core businesses and appropriately diversified in operation”. At the end of 2006, China Life Property & Casualty Insurance Company Limited and China Life Pension Company Limited were successively established. Meanwhile, restructuring was basically accomplished on China Life Insurance (Overseas) Company Limited, China Life Investment Holding Company Limited and Insurance Professional College. By then, a group layout took initial shape through integration of life insurance, property & casualty insurance, corporate annuity, capital management, industrial investment and insurance education.
On January 9, 2007, the Life Company returned successfully to China A share market in Shanghai, thus making itself China's only financial insurer triple-listed home and abroad. With such unchallenged position, China Life further defined its goal to build itself into a world-class financial and insurance group by implementing the conglomeration strategy of “being exceptionally strong in core businesses and appropriately diversified in operation”. To realize the goal, China Life clarified a scientific roadmap with its own characteristics, and put forward the strategic requirements of comprehensively enhancing integrated operation and management capability. China Life has strived to make itself even bigger, stronger and better in a more appropriate and faster way. [6]
There is no business relationship between China Life Insurance Company in Mainland China and Taiwan.
3.02 billion yuan in illegal activities[edit]
China's audit office said it uncovered "improper and illegal activities" involving 3.02 billion yuan at two of the country's largest insurers, People's Insurance Co. of China Ltd. and China Life Insurance Co., during an audit of their 2009 books. They are charged with offences including the illegal sale of policies, overstating policy sales, improper claim settlements, illegal distributions of commissions and "grey income" - off-the-books gains, some of which company officials pocketed among themselves.
These violations have raised concern amongst some Chinese citizens over the authenticity and legality of the policies they currently hold. They are worried about where their money is going and what it is being used for. Without transparency, trust is quickly evaporating from businesses that are found to be conducting shady business.[7]

China Life Insurance Company Limited (short China Life, Chinese: 中国人寿保险; pinyin: Zhōngguó rénshòu bǎoxiǎn) is a Beijing-based China-incorporated company that provides life insurance and annuity products. China Life is ranked No. 94 on Fortune 2015 Global 500 Company list. [2] China Life, which is 70% state-owned, is the biggest life insurer in China, but is coming off a few rocky years. China's insurance market attracted dozens of new competitors after the Chinese government liberalized it, and China Life's market share has fallen by almost half since 2007, from 50% to around 26%, according to Morningstar. The company is completing a major restructuring, and the government assigned it a new CEO in 2014. A new sales push early this year (fueled by an army of newly hired agents) led to a big bump in net income in the first quarter of 2015. China Life is also ranked on Fortune China: 2015 Top 500 Chinese Enterprises at No.13.
China Life has more than 600,000 agents nationwide, making its cost of acquiring new customers relatively low. China Life has a substantial share of China's group life and health insurance business, and its government ties give it an inroad to help it build that business among state-owned enterprises.[3]
In 2015 China's government allowed Chinese insurance companies to invest in foreign real estate; China Life subsequently made its first such investment, in a Boston waterfront project. [4]

China Life Insurance Company Limited is the largest life insurer in the People's Republic of China. The company offers individual life insurance, group life, accident insurance, and health insurance policies. China Life commands 45 percent of that market, and holds the number one position in 29 of the country's 31 major markets—only Shanghai and Beijing, where the company nonetheless is number two, escape its dominance. Formed from the breakup of former government-owned monopoly People's Insurance Company of China, China Life is the only life insurance company in China with a national operating license, which has permitted it to develop a network of more than 8,000 field offices, 4,800 branch offices, 3,000 customer service offices, and 87,000 sales outlets in such locations as banks, post offices, hotels, airports, travel agents, and the like. The company's nearly 67,000 employees are complemented by a network of 650,000 exclusive independent sales agents. The company also operates a "one-stop" 24-hour telephone sales and service hotline. Together, China Life serves more than 100 million long-term policy holders and more than 150 million short-term policy holders, generating nearly CNY 51 billion ($6.2 billion) in net premiums and policy fees in 2003. The group's total sales topped $9.5 billion that year. China Life listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange at the end of 2003, raising $3.5 billion in that year's largest initial public offering (IPO). China has indicated its intention to expand into other financial areas, such as asset management, brokering, and banking.
Inheriting China's Pre-Revolution Insurance Industry The opening of China to the West in the early years of the 20th century led to a variety of new business opportunities. By the end of World War I, China, and especially Shanghai, had become a major center for international trade, although dominated by foreign interests. The lively commercial market in that city offered entrepreneurs seemingly unlimited potential; among these was the young C.V. Starr, an American, who founded an insurance agent's office in Shanghai in 1919. At first, Starr's company, American Asiatic Underwriters (AAU), served as a local representative for foreign insurers.
AAU originally dealt in fire and marine insurance policies. In the early 1920s, however, Starr recognized the vast potential for life insurance among the country's Chinese population. Starr set up a new company, Asia Life Insurance Company, which became the first to market life insurance products to the Chinese. The company's head start allowed it to build quickly into a leading insurance provider not only across the Chinese mainland, but throughout much of the Asian region. Starr's company eventually evolved into U.S. leader American Insurance Group. In the meantime, Asia Life's success inspired a raft of competitors. Most of these were local representatives of large foreign companies. A number of local groups appeared, however, and played an important role in developing the life insurance market among the indigenous population.
One of the earliest and most important of these companies was the Tai Ping Insurance Company, which was incorporated in Shanghai in 1929. Founded by Mr. H.N. Ting (Ting Hsieh Nung) with the help from the Chin Chen Bank Shanghai, the new company received start-up investments from a number of Chinese banks and began issuing general insurance policies. The following year, Tai Ping added a life insurance component, Tai Ping Life Insurance Company. Tai Ping developed strongly through the 1930s, adding nearly 20 branches in major cities in China as well as elsewhere in southeast Asia. The company also opened some 400 secondary offices across the Chinese mainland, before adding representative offices in Europe and in the Americas.
By the mid-1930s, Tai Ping had grown sufficiently large to become a member of the Shanghai Insurance Association, the only Chinese-owned company to be included in what had previously been an exclusive club for foreign insurers. Tai Ping's fortunes began to dwindle after the start of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and especially with the Mao-led Communist revolution in 1949.
Tai Ping in the meantime had been joined by a growing number of other Chinese-owned insurance companies. Among these were China Insurance Company, founded in 1931 in Shanghai, which opened a life insurance subsidiary, China Life Insurance Company in 1933. Later insurance market entries included Ming An Insurance Company, established in Hong Kong in 1949. By then, China boasted more than 240 insurance companies—some 180 of which were Chinese owned.
Following the revolution, the Mao government set up the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), which took over all insurance interests on the mainland. Tai Ping's leadership fled to Taiwan in 1950, reestablishing the company's operations there. Other companies, especially those that had set up foreign branches in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Saigon and elsewhere, withdrew from the mainland to rebuild their businesses around their foreign holdings. Foreign insurance companies were simply expelled outright, and their holdings regrouped under PICC as well.
At first the PICC monopoly continued to operate its various insurance services, integrating the assets of the former independent insurance sector. By 1952, PICC represented a national network of 1,300 branches and 3,000 agency outlets. Yet the Chinese government, in its effort to develop its regime, determined that insurance was superfluous in a state where the government was meant to provide for all social welfare for its citizens. In 1959, therefore, all domestic insurance business was ended. PICC's role was reduced to providing insurance covering the country's foreign policy needs, such as for the marine and aviation sectors. Following the reform, PICC was converted into a department of the government's central bank.
Reforming in the 1980s Economic reforms launched under Deng Xiaoping in 1978 paved the way to a rebirth in China's insurance sector. In 1979, the People's Insurance Company of China was separated from the central bank and reestablished as an independently operating, although state-controlled, company. In that year, PICC began offering general (i.e., non-life) insurance policies. In 1980, as the first initiatives to bring foreign investment capital in the country emerged, PICC formed a joint venture with American Insurance Group—allowing the American company to test the waters before making a broader return to the mainland insurance market in the 1990s.
PICC began offering life insurance policies again in 1982, targeting the small but growing numbers of middle-class and wealthy Chinese, as well as government officials. Nonetheless, the Chinese life insurance market remained tiny—as late as 2004, per capita spending on life insurance amounted to the equivalent of just $28, compared with average per capita spending of as much $2,800 or more in Japan, offering tantalizing prospects for future growth.
PICC officially retained its monopoly on the Chinese insurance market into the late 1980s. In 1988, however, the company's monopoly was abolished. Licenses were granted to the company's first competitors, including Ping An, which, established that year, grew into the country's second largest life insurer, with a dominance in the important Beijing market. Other early domestic competitors included China Pacific, based in Shanghai, which also started business in 1988, and American Insurance Group, which, in 1992, became the first foreign company to be granted a license to operate a self-standing business on the mainland (i.e., not as part of a joint venture with a local partner). Nonetheless, PICC remained the clear insurance champion on the mainland, with a strong national presence. The company also began opening offices overseas, adding locations in Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and London.
Public Company for the New Century The Chinese government began a wider opening of the country's insurance market in the early 1990s. By the end of the decade, the government had granted licenses to a total of 16 companies—including such returning groups as Tai Ping Insurance Company and China Insurance Company. The increasingly competitive environment led to a need to change PICC's structure. In 1996, the company reorganized as a holding company, called PICC Group. Its operations were then broken up into three subsidiaries, PICC Life, PICC Property, and PICC Reinsurance. PICC Group initially operated under the control of the People's Bank of China.
Despite the restructuring, PICC Group was somewhat hampered in its growth. The arrival of AIG had introduced a new tied-agency system into the market, encouraging the development of branch networks. Yet PICC Group, as a state-owned enterprise, was initially barred from developing its own network of branch offices and tied agents. As a result, the company was forced to cede the leadership spot in two of the country's most important markets, Beijing, captured by Ping An, and Shanghai, taken by China Pacific.
In 1998, the Chinese government transferred oversight of the country's growing insurance market to a new body, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC). Under new rules, insurance companies were prohibited from operating in both the non-life and life insurance markets. As a result, PICC Group was broken up into its four primary components: PICC, which took over the company's general insurance business; China Re, for its reinsurance operations; China Insurance, which handled the group's international activities; and China Life. All four companies remained controlled by the Chinese state.
Yet the former members of PICC Group began moving toward an opening of its share capital at the beginning of the 2000s. In 2000, China Life announced its intention to diversify its own shareholding in advance of a future public offering. In the meantime, the company continued to build up its business across China, solidifying its dominant position in 29 of the country's 30 major markets. China Life also was helped by the government's rule for foreign corporations operating in China, which stipulated that all employees in these companies must be covered by unified insurance policies. In response, China Life concentrated its unified insurance operations at its Guangdong Branch, close to the rapidly expanding free-trade zone, in which the majority of foreign enterprises had set up their Chinese operations. By 2001, China Life had captured 80 percent of the unified insurance business for the top 500 foreign firms operating in China.
China Life then began petitioning the CIRC for authorization to go public, which was granted in June 2003. As part of the run up to the company's IPO, China Life restructured its operations, splitting into three entities: China Life Insurance Company and China Life Asset Management Company, both of which were placed under a new holding company, China Life Insurance Corporation.
In order to make its IPO more attractive, the parent holding transferred only long- and medium-term policies issued on or after June 10, 1999, to China Life. This move was made in order to avoid launching China Life with the burden of a large number of loss-making policies issued at return rates as high as 6.5 percent. The June 10, 1999 date corresponded to an emergency ruling by the CIRC, which lowered return rates to just 2.5 percent.
To attract as wide a pool of investors as possible, China Life launched its IPO on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange in December 2003. The IPO was a huge success, raising $3.5 billion and becoming the world's largest for that year. The retail offer had been oversubscribed by 172 times, and the total order had reached $80 billion.
The success of its IPO encouraged China Life to begin eyeing expansion into new markets in 2004. China Life's unlisted parent company announced its intention to diversify its insurance business to include property insurance and develop an insurance intermediary agent business as well as add other financial services. China Life itself announced its intention to diversify into new services, such as asset management, brokerage services, and banking in the near future. In the meantime, China Life had emerged as the dominant player in what many expected to become the world's fastest-growing and largest life insurance market.

It became a public-listed company on December 18, 2003, with a market capitalization of US$5,756 million as of August 31, 2005. ¥832.5Billion was frozen during the IPO. The domestic listing, the first by an insurer in China, drew bids for about 49 times the stock on offer. The gains allow China Life to pass ING Group NV, Allianz SE and Axa to become the world's no. 2 insurer with a market value of $129 billion, behind American International Group's $186 billion. China Life is also listed in China since Jan of 2007.
In 2006, the new Executive Board put forward the conglomeration strategy of “being exceptionally strong in core businesses and appropriately diversified in operation”. At the end of 2006, China Life Property & Casualty Insurance Company Limited and China Life Pension Company Limited were successively established. Meanwhile, restructuring was basically accomplished on China Life Insurance (Overseas) Company Limited, China Life Investment Holding Company Limited and Insurance Professional College. By then, a group layout took initial shape through integration of life insurance, property & casualty insurance, corporate annuity, capital management, industrial investment and insurance education.
On January 9, 2007, the Life Company returned successfully to China A share market in Shanghai, thus making itself China's only financial insurer triple-listed home and abroad. With such unchallenged position, China Life further defined its goal to build itself into a world-class financial and insurance group by implementing the conglomeration strategy of “being exceptionally strong in core businesses and appropriately diversified in operation”. To realize the goal, China Life clarified a scientific roadmap with its own characteristics, and put forward the strategic requirements of comprehensively enhancing integrated operation and management capability. China Life has strived to make itself even bigger, stronger and better in a more appropriate and faster way. [6]
There is no business relationship between China Life Insurance Company in Mainland China and Taiwan.
3.02 billion yuan in illegal activities[edit]
China's audit office said it uncovered "improper and illegal activities" involving 3.02 billion yuan at two of the country's largest insurers, People's Insurance Co. of China Ltd. and China Life Insurance Co., during an audit of their 2009 books. They are charged with offences including the illegal sale of policies, overstating policy sales, improper claim settlements, illegal distributions of commissions and "grey income" - off-the-books gains, some of which company officials pocketed among themselves.
These violations have raised concern amongst some Chinese citizens over the authenticity and legality of the policies they currently hold. They are worried about where their money is going and what it is being used for. Without transparency, trust is quickly evaporating from businesses that are found to be conducting shady business.[7]

Consumer Tip: Lifely Term is a term life insurance product issued with limited underwriting and limited medical evidence of insurability. You may be able to purchase other life insurance products (including our other term life products) for substantially less cost if you apply for a life insurance product with full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability. However, if you submit to full underwriting and/or provide medical evidence of insurability, you may be required to pay more for a fully underwritten product that if you purchased a Lifely Term policy.

FAQ
These FAQs provide some information about Lifely Term and about life insurance generally. Only a policy will have complete details on how the policy works, how to qualify for benefits, what restrictions or limitations apply, and terms for keeping the policy in effect. 
What else should I know about life insurance?


What is term insurance?

Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides protection for a set period of time. If you (the insured person) die during this period, the policy will pay a death benefit to the person or people you designate; these are called your beneficiaries. 
With Lifely Term, you can choose a term period of 10, 15, or 20 years. The policy and death benefit coverage end when the term period expires. The policy is not convertible to another policy, it does not have cash value and it does not have a return of premium feature.


What is a premium?

Premiums are the amounts you pay to begin your policy and keep it in effect. 
For Lifely Term, your premium is automatically deducted each month from the bank account you choose.

What happens if I miss a payment?

Your policy will enter a grace period. If you do not pay your premium by the end of the grace period shown in your policy, your policy will end without value and you will no longer be covered.

How do I know which term period to select?

Think about the reasons you’re purchasing the policy. Consider not only the expenses you want to help ensure your family will be able to pay without your income but also for how long they will still rely on your financial support.
Also consider that life insurance generally becomes more expensive as one gets older.  Once your policy ends, if you want to buy another policy, you typically will need to qualify again. In the time between policies, your health may change, perhaps causing you to pay a higher premium or even be denied coverage later on.

How do I know which death benefit payment period to choose?

For how many years after your death will your family need the financial support of this policy’s death benefit? The answer to this question will guide you.

How does the death benefit get paid to my beneficiaries?

The death benefit will be paid to your beneficiaries in monthly payments. These payments will be for the benefit amount you choose and for the number of years you select.
With Lifely Term, you can choose the benefit payment period—the number of years that you’d like your beneficiaries to receive payments from this policy if you pass away. You can choose benefit payment periods of 10, 15, 20, or 30 years. Please note that you cannot change the payment period after the policy is issued.

Will the monthly death benefit be taxed?

Yes. Although the death benefit of most other life insurance policies is paid out generally free of federal income tax, a portion of Lifely Term's benefit, which is paid out monthly as chosen when you apply, will be considered income to your beneficiary for income tax purposes. Please keep this in mind when considering Lifely Term.

Are death benefits paid out as the result of a suicide?

In general, if the insured person dies by suicide in the first two years from when the policy is issued, the policy will end and all premiums will be returned. A new suicide exclusion period may begin if we agree to reinstate a policy that ends because of a missed premium payment.

Why are you asking about my health and lifestyle?

We use information about your health and habits to determine your eligibility for the policy.

What if I want to change or add beneficiaries later?

As a policyholder, you can change your beneficiary designation at any time and as often as you’d like by contacting Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

If I die, when will my beneficiaries receive the money?

Monthly payment of benefits will begin after we receive proof of death and the forms we require.

When does my coverage start?

Assuming your policy is approved, coverage begins immediately once we have received your first payment and your signed acceptance of your policy.

Can I cancel my policy at any time?

Yes. Please refer to your policy for cancellation details or call Customer Service at 844-499-0771.

Where does the information come from?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

How can you check my identity online?

We are able to search public records, such as county or city records.  We do not access or affect your credit file.

What do you do with the answers?

What else should i know about life insurance?


THE BENEFITS OF LIFE INSURANCE
If you're like most people, you don't want to think about the possibility of dying. You expect to live for a long time and purchasing life insurance is not your first priority. But, have you considered the consequences of not having life insurance?   Because of the many different types of life insurance products available, making the right choice appears to be complicated, but it needn't be so. 


WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF INSURANCE?
There are two basic types of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance.  Term Life Insurance is an attractive solution to help protect you and your family with affordable and flexible policy options.
Term insurance can provide inexpensive coverage to meet specific needs.  It provides a stated benefit when you pass away, provided your death occurs within a specified time period. Term life insurance does not provide any benefits in case of disability or accidental injury.  In general, term products do not have cash values available for loan or withdrawal. Term life insurance premiums are generally lower for a period of time. After this period, some term policies end while others may be renewed, but with dramatically higher premiums. Purchasing a new policy after the end of your term period can be very expensive and you may have to have a medical exam to prove insurability.
Term is often considered appropriate when coverage is only required for a specific period of time; for instance, until your children graduate from college. The benefits can be used to replace income you would have earned to help pay off a mortgage or help maintain your family's lifestyle, for example. In addition, benefits can help cover funeral expenses.
Return of premium term is a slightly different type of term insurance. Premiums tend to be higher with the benefit being that the premiums paid are returned to you at the end of the level term period, provided you meet the conditions set by the insurance company.
Some term insurance policies include a conversion privilege. This benefit gives you the option to convert your term policy to a permanent policy before the end of the conversion period without having to take another medical exam to be approved for coverage. However, in most cases, premiums for the permanent policy will be higher than the premiums you've been paying for the term policy.
Permanent insurance can cover you for as long as you live (as long as you pay sufficient premiums and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals). The premiums are generally higher than term insurance during the term period. After this period, however, premiums for a permanent policy may be less than term policy premiums. 
Permanent insurance combines the security of insurance protection with the ability to accumulate some cash values inside the policy. These funds are generally allowed to grow within the policy on a tax-deferred basis and may be used to supplement income, or meet emergency or other financial needs in the future. These values may be accessed through policy loans or withdrawals during the insured's lifetime.  Please note that, although you can use the cash value of your whole life insurance for these purposes, the primary reason for purchasing life insurance should be for the death benefit it provides.
Also keep in mind that unpaid loans and withdrawals will reduce future cash value, policy benefits and guarantees. Under certain circumstances withdrawals may be taxable; loans are generally not taxable. Any loans that are outstanding when a policy lapses or is surrendered will cause immediate taxation on the amount loaned in excess of the premium paid¹.  Any outstanding loans at the time of death will be deducted from the proceeds of the death benefit along with any accrued interest on the loan.
There are three types of permanent life insurance: 1) traditional (or "classic" ); 2) universal (also called "flexible premium" or "adjustable" ); 3) variable.  All types offer cash values and guaranteed death benefits. Traditional and universal life policies offer cash values that are a combination of guaranteed and non-guaranteed elements. The non-guaranteed elements usually include any dividends earned (traditional) or earnings in excess of the contractually guaranteed cash values (universal).
While most variable life policies also provide a guaranteed death benefit, the cash value of a variable life insurance policy is not guaranteed and fluctuates based on the performance of the underlying investment options that you choose. Because you bear the investment risk as opposed to the insurance company, variable life is considered a "security," subject to federal securities laws and protections, and is sold by prospectus. With a variable life insurance policy, the guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the applicable issuing company and they do not apply to the investment performance or safety of the underlying subaccounts in the particular policy.


CONSIDERATIONS
There are some risks you should consider when purchasing life insurance.  These are:

Insurability Risk
Inadequate Coverage Risk
Premium Risk
Cash Value Accumulation Risk

Most people have a certain risk threshold - a comfort zone.  To manage your zone, it is helpful to understand the risks present in each situation and how they may apply to you.

Insurability Risk
Life insurance premiums are based on age and health.  The younger and healthier you are, the more inexpensive it is.  As you age, life insurance becomes more costly.  Typically you become less healthy over time; in addition, serious illnesses can strike at any time.  This could affect your ability to purchase life insurance in the future, or the premiums you pay.  This is called "insurability risk". 
Permanent insurance has a lower degree of insurability risk because coverage lasts throughout your lifetime without having to reapply, as long as you pay premiums when due and there are no substantial loans or withdrawals (though some variable life policies provide no guaranteed coverage). Buying permanent insurance when you are young and healthy can lock in lower premiums for life.
Some term insurance, with no conversion privilege, has a higher degree of insurability risk because your insurance coverage lasts for only a specified period of time (such as ten years). 

Inadequate Coverage Risk
Unfortunately death is a certainty.  Life insurance provides your beneficiaries with money to help meet their current and future financial obligations.  They may use the funds to pay off debts, cover college costs, continue your business or manage other financial obligations.  Without sufficient money to meet these obligations, your beneficiaries may be left with credit card bills or outstanding loans, or may be forced to alter their lifestyles significantly.
You have taken an important first step by considering the purchase of insurance at this time.  We encourage you to regularly and carefully evaluate whether your insurance portfolio is right for you given your financial status, objectives, obligations, and risk tolerance at any point in time.  It's no secret that as your life changes, your needs change too. 

Premium Risk
The two questions most people ask when considering the purchase of life insurance are: "How will I pay for this now?" and "Will I be able to afford this in the future?"
When considering which type of insurance is right for you, there are two risks associated with premium payments that you should think about: one, premiums may increase in the future; and two, premiums may need to be paid longer than you expected. These risks are called "premium risk".
From the perspective of being able to cover current premium payments, term insurance has a lower degree of premium risk because its initial cost is generally lower than of permanent insurance.  From the perspective of affording premium payments in the future, particularly if you need coverage longer than you initially thought, term insurance has a higher degree of premium risk.  The reason for this is that if you purchase new coverage in the future, as discussed earlier, premium costs become higher the older you become.  Health impairments may also increase the cost of new coverage.  And if you choose to keep your original term product, the premiums may increase sharply after the initial level term period.

Cash Value Accumulation Risk
If you are like most people, you have two distinct needs-one for a death benefit and the other to accumulate funds to meet life's expenses as they arise. A life insurance policy definitely meets the first need.  Although the primary reason to purchase life insurance is for the death benefit protection, some types of life insurance may also provide you the opportunity to accumulate accessible cash value within the policy itself. 
Permanent life insurance is the type of product that can accumulate cash values. These cash values may be accessed via loans and/or withdrawals to help in any number of ways, including paying off your mortgage early, supplementing your retirement income, or taking advantage of potential business opportunities. (Remember that withdrawals and loans will reduce policy cash values and the death benefit and may have tax consequences.)  However, you need to be aware of the costs and expenses that are associated with the policy that you purchase, and how these may impact the growth of your cash value.
Some types of permanent insurance actually allow you to pay more premiums than required to help give a boost to your cash values.  However , there is a limit on just how much you can pay into the policy; if you put in too much money, it becomes more expensive to access the cash values.  Your policy has now become a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC).  Instead of being able to withdraw up to basis (the amount equal to the premiums you have paid) and then borrow the balance of your accumulated cash values, all value you access will be taxable to the extent of income in the policy and there may be an additional 10% federal income tax on distributions prior to age 59½. 
One way that many people use to meet both their need of death benefit protection and their need for additional cash is to buy a lower cost term insurance product and then save or invest the difference between the term insurance cost and the permanent insurance cost.  The earlier you are able to put aside some funds the better as you may receive the positive affects of compound interest growth on your money.  The longer you delay, the greater your risk becomes in not being able to accumulate the funds you need.  This approach requires a commitment to regularly set money aside for savings.  This commitment may be difficult to meet when unexpected expenses arise and may not be for everyone.


MAKING YOUR DECISION
Now that you are a little more knowledgeable, take a look at your personal situation, consider the types of insurance available to you and make the decision that works for you and your family. 
Everyone has their own goals for personal financial security and the important thing is that you progress towards achieving your goals. You may wish to maximize your insurance coverage today or you may wish to purchase a policy you can "personalize" to meet your needs by adding riders that provide you with additional insurance coverage. You may wish to purchase a permanent life insurance policy and supplement it with term insurance for additional coverage during a particular period of time. For example, you may want extra protection during certain years such as coverage to help cover payments on a mortgage, or added protection for your children or spouse.
Look at your options and determine what works for you.  We're here to help.

Hi. Welcome to Lifely by Prudential! Thanks for stopping by.You may be wondering what Lifely is — and that's a good question. Lifely by Prudential is a program aimed to make purchasing life insurance easier.  We are trying to think differently about life insurance for today's consumer. To that end, we introduce Lifely Term, a policy offered by Pruco Life Insurance Company, a Prudential Financial company.  
 
When You Take Care of the Ones You Love, You Take Care of the World. 
 
There's an old adage in the insurance world that "Life insurance is sold, not bought." But we think that times are changing, and people today are more informed and more in control of their financial future. You know you need life insurance, right? So, we set out to design a way for you to be able to access, learn about, and purchase life insurance that makes it easy. We know that life insurance can be difficult to understand, can make you feel like you don't know where to start, and sometimes can turn people away (We have to mention "death." That’s uncomfortable.) 
So we're trying to change all of that. 
You are thinking big about your impact on the world and constantly looking for small ways to improve the world we live in. We want to help you understand that, by protecting the ones you love with life insurance, you can free them to go on to do great things for this world after you’re gone. Maybe even make all of humanity a little better. The way we see it, when you take care of the ones you love, you take care of the world. It's just that simple. 
 
Quick. Click. Insure our Humanity. 

Lifely Term is a practical life insurance policy designed with you in mind. The process is easy (online) and easy to understand (Just answer a few simple questions), and a policy is easy to purchase (Get it done today!). 
Right now, Lifely Term is available only in the state of California. (Sorry, remaining 49 states! We hope to be available to you soon!)
Thanks for coming by. We hope you stick around and maybe even help insure our humanity.
Lifely is a brand name of The Prudential Insurance Company of America and its subsidiaries.
Lifely Term (PCT-2016) is issued in California by the Pruco Life Insurance Company, located in Newark, NJ. The Pruco Life Insurance Company and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are Prudential Financial companies and each is solely responsible for its own financial condition and contractual obligations.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If you initiate arbitration, Healthplans.com will promptly reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under AAA Rules once you have notified Healthplans.com in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration proceedings.

The parties to this arbitration agreement acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is nonseverable from the agreement to arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot be enforced, then the parties’ agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST Healthplans.com IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU WOULD HAVE HAD A RIGHT TO LITIGATE THROUGH A COURT, TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. HOWEVER, YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.
You shall have thirty (30) days from the date that you submit your personally identifiable information to opt-out of this arbitration agreement. To opt out of arbitration you must email us at legal@healthplans.com. If more than thirty (30) days have passed, you are not eligible to opt out of arbitration.

Term Life Insurance
A Term Life policy offers coverage only if death occurs during a specific period of time, which coincides with the terms in which the insured member is required to make a monthly premium. A Term Life policy pays a benefit to the beneficiaries only if the policy holder dies during the time period for which the policy was initially contracted and has remained current on their annual or monthly premium payments.
This type of policy is beneficial for parents of young children, people with debt obligations and also home buyers. It can be renewed after the initial term has ended and it may also be converted to a whole life policy. The premiums are based on your age and your health status. Purchasing a new Term policy at the expiration of your existing policy will result in a higher premium and you may not qualify if you have disqualifying health issues.
Term Life is a "death benefit only" policy that you buy for a specified length of time. Think of it like leasing a car: you pay for the use of the car for a specified period and when the contract period is over, you return the car.
Term Life is referred to as "benefit only" insurance because unlike the various types of permanent life such as Whole Life, it carries no "cash surrender value". Because of this, Term Life insurance premiums tend to be very affordable. Young and relatively healthy individuals can often obtain a policy with limited or no medical background check. It is ideal for families that are just starting out, or for the family income provider who wants to make sure his or her family will be protected, but may not be able to afford, or desire a permanent life policy. However, understand that as a person ages over the period of the term, monthly premiums may increase.
It is often an ideal option to insure a second spouse, or for single people, even for children, just to make sure the often unexpectedly expensive costs of a funeral are covered. There are many insurance and financial professionals who suggest that those who purchase a Term Life policy can make up for the investment component of a Permanent Life insurance policy by investing the cost savings between the two on their own.
The earlier you purchase a term life policy and the healthier you are, the cheaper the premiums will be over the term of the policy.
Annual Renewable Term Life policies are those that are purchased year-by-year. The next year you do not have to prequalify. Simply choose to renew at what may or may not be an increased rate. Rates for Annual Renewable policies are at historic lows. A young healthy person can get $250,000.00 for only a few hundred dollars per year.
There are very good rates these days on Term Life. The premium is fixed and will not go up for the life of the term, usually 10,15, 20 or 30 years. It is not uncommon for a healthy non-smoking 40 year-old male to obtain a 20 or 30-year policy with a fixed premium of less than $30 per month.
So just how much Insurance should you buy? Many things factor into that answer, but at the minimum the experts say purchase enough insurance to equal at least 5-7 years of your present salary. If you have young children, make that around 10 years. So, if you make $50,000 a year that means at least $250,000 to $500,000 in coverage. Feel free to use our Life Insurance Calculator to help determine the right amount for your circumstances.
Term Life Insurance is an affordable life insurance product to ensure that your loved ones are protected in the event of your unexpected death, for a specific term period of time.

The Lowest Rates and Best Coverage

LifePlans.com is dedicated to helping you find the best life insurance policy, while saving you as much money as possible! How do we do that? Simply put, our technology and relationships are what enable us to pass the savings onto you.
Life insurance companies are constantly calculating and updating rates based on the changing demographics of the US population. LifePlans.com is connected to the databases of the leading carriers to help you find the best deal while using the most up-to-date rates.
What’s better is that our service is 100% free, and super-fast! All you have to do is:


1. Confirm your zip code.
2. Tell us about yourself and your coverage needs.
3. See your custom-results and start comparing multiple quotes.


As you are shopping around, there are certain questions that you should ask yourself. The best one to start with is: “How much coverage do I need?”  To give you an idea, most people opt for a Term Policy with about $250,000 in coverage. Why this amount or any amount for that matter? The answer is that it all depends on how much debt you would need to payoff and how much income you would need to replace in the event you are no longer around to provide for your loved ones.
Another good question to ask yourself, or one of the several qualified agents LifePlans.com can connect you with, is how long do want to be covered and whether an investment component in your policy is right for you. Unlike a term policy, which as its name suggests has rates and coverage based on a set term or number of years, a Permanent Policy does not expire. Typically, Whole Life, the most common type of permanent insurance, not only serves to pay-out your beneficiaries upon your passing, but also has a current cash value that can be borrowed against or cashed-out anytime. Essentially,               permanent policies are investments and can grow in value whereas term policies do not.  The catch is that they often have higher premiums. You can learn more about life insurance and policy types by clicking on the icons below.
So with flexible policy options plus the best rates and coverage, don’t wait any longer. Secure your coverage now with LifePlans.com and get back to living your life with those who matter most!

China Life Insurance Company Limited (short China Life, Chinese: 中国人寿保险; pinyin: Zhōngguó rénshòu bǎoxiǎn) is a Beijing-based China-incorporated company that provides life insurance and annuity products. China Life is ranked No. 94 on Fortune 2015 Global 500 Company list. [2] China Life, which is 70% state-owned, is the biggest life insurer in China, but is coming off a few rocky years. China's insurance market attracted dozens of new competitors after the Chinese government liberalized it, and China Life's market share has fallen by almost half since 2007, from 50% to around 26%, according to Morningstar. The company is completing a major restructuring, and the government assigned it a new CEO in 2014. A new sales push early this year (fueled by an army of newly hired agents) led to a big bump in net income in the first quarter of 2015. China Life is also ranked on Fortune China: 2015 Top 500 Chinese Enterprises at No.13.
China Life has more than 600,000 agents nationwide, making its cost of acquiring new customers relatively low. China Life has a substantial share of China's group life and health insurance business, and its government ties give it an inroad to help it build that business among state-owned enterprises.[3]
In 2015 China's government allowed Chinese insurance companies to invest in foreign real estate; China Life subsequently made its first such investment, in a Boston waterfront project. [4]

China Life Insurance Company Limited is the largest life insurer in the People's Republic of China. The company offers individual life insurance, group life, accident insurance, and health insurance policies. China Life commands 45 percent of that market, and holds the number one position in 29 of the country's 31 major markets—only Shanghai and Beijing, where the company nonetheless is number two, escape its dominance. Formed from the breakup of former government-owned monopoly People's Insurance Company of China, China Life is the only life insurance company in China with a national operating license, which has permitted it to develop a network of more than 8,000 field offices, 4,800 branch offices, 3,000 customer service offices, and 87,000 sales outlets in such locations as banks, post offices, hotels, airports, travel agents, and the like. The company's nearly 67,000 employees are complemented by a network of 650,000 exclusive independent sales agents. The company also operates a "one-stop" 24-hour telephone sales and service hotline. Together, China Life serves more than 100 million long-term policy holders and more than 150 million short-term policy holders, generating nearly CNY 51 billion ($6.2 billion) in net premiums and policy fees in 2003. The group's total sales topped $9.5 billion that year. China Life listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange at the end of 2003, raising $3.5 billion in that year's largest initial public offering (IPO). China has indicated its intention to expand into other financial areas, such as asset management, brokering, and banking.
Inheriting China's Pre-Revolution Insurance Industry The opening of China to the West in the early years of the 20th century led to a variety of new business opportunities. By the end of World War I, China, and especially Shanghai, had become a major center for international trade, although dominated by foreign interests. The lively commercial market in that city offered entrepreneurs seemingly unlimited potential; among these was the young C.V. Starr, an American, who founded an insurance agent's office in Shanghai in 1919. At first, Starr's company, American Asiatic Underwriters (AAU), served as a local representative for foreign insurers.
AAU originally dealt in fire and marine insurance policies. In the early 1920s, however, Starr recognized the vast potential for life insurance among the country's Chinese population. Starr set up a new company, Asia Life Insurance Company, which became the first to market life insurance products to the Chinese. The company's head start allowed it to build quickly into a leading insurance provider not only across the Chinese mainland, but throughout much of the Asian region. Starr's company eventually evolved into U.S. leader American Insurance Group. In the meantime, Asia Life's success inspired a raft of competitors. Most of these were local representatives of large foreign companies. A number of local groups appeared, however, and played an important role in developing the life insurance market among the indigenous population.
One of the earliest and most important of these companies was the Tai Ping Insurance Company, which was incorporated in Shanghai in 1929. Founded by Mr. H.N. Ting (Ting Hsieh Nung) with the help from the Chin Chen Bank Shanghai, the new company received start-up investments from a number of Chinese banks and began issuing general insurance policies. The following year, Tai Ping added a life insurance component, Tai Ping Life Insurance Company. Tai Ping developed strongly through the 1930s, adding nearly 20 branches in major cities in China as well as elsewhere in southeast Asia. The company also opened some 400 secondary offices across the Chinese mainland, before adding representative offices in Europe and in the Americas.
By the mid-1930s, Tai Ping had grown sufficiently large to become a member of the Shanghai Insurance Association, the only Chinese-owned company to be included in what had previously been an exclusive club for foreign insurers. Tai Ping's fortunes began to dwindle after the start of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and especially with the Mao-led Communist revolution in 1949.
Tai Ping in the meantime had been joined by a growing number of other Chinese-owned insurance companies. Among these were China Insurance Company, founded in 1931 in Shanghai, which opened a life insurance subsidiary, China Life Insurance Company in 1933. Later insurance market entries included Ming An Insurance Company, established in Hong Kong in 1949. By then, China boasted more than 240 insurance companies—some 180 of which were Chinese owned.
Following the revolution, the Mao government set up the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), which took over all insurance interests on the mainland. Tai Ping's leadership fled to Taiwan in 1950, reestablishing the company's operations there. Other companies, especially those that had set up foreign branches in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Saigon and elsewhere, withdrew from the mainland to rebuild their businesses around their foreign holdings. Foreign insurance companies were simply expelled outright, and their holdings regrouped under PICC as well.
At first the PICC monopoly continued to operate its various insurance services, integrating the assets of the former independent insurance sector. By 1952, PICC represented a national network of 1,300 branches and 3,000 agency outlets. Yet the Chinese government, in its effort to develop its regime, determined that insurance was superfluous in a state where the government was meant to provide for all social welfare for its citizens. In 1959, therefore, all domestic insurance business was ended. PICC's role was reduced to providing insurance covering the country's foreign policy needs, such as for the marine and aviation sectors. Following the reform, PICC was converted into a department of the government's central bank.
Reforming in the 1980s Economic reforms launched under Deng Xiaoping in 1978 paved the way to a rebirth in China's insurance sector. In 1979, the People's Insurance Company of China was separated from the central bank and reestablished as an independently operating, although state-controlled, company. In that year, PICC began offering general (i.e., non-life) insurance policies. In 1980, as the first initiatives to bring foreign investment capital in the country emerged, PICC formed a joint venture with American Insurance Group—allowing the American company to test the waters before making a broader return to the mainland insurance market in the 1990s.
PICC began offering life insurance policies again in 1982, targeting the small but growing numbers of middle-class and wealthy Chinese, as well as government officials. Nonetheless, the Chinese life insurance market remained tiny—as late as 2004, per capita spending on life insurance amounted to the equivalent of just $28, compared with average per capita spending of as much $2,800 or more in Japan, offering tantalizing prospects for future growth.
PICC officially retained its monopoly on the Chinese insurance market into the late 1980s. In 1988, however, the company's monopoly was abolished. Licenses were granted to the company's first competitors, including Ping An, which, established that year, grew into the country's second largest life insurer, with a dominance in the important Beijing market. Other early domestic competitors included China Pacific, based in Shanghai, which also started business in 1988, and American Insurance Group, which, in 1992, became the first foreign company to be granted a license to operate a self-standing business on the mainland (i.e., not as part of a joint venture with a local partner). Nonetheless, PICC remained the clear insurance champion on the mainland, with a strong national presence. The company also began opening offices overseas, adding locations in Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and London.
Public Company for the New Century The Chinese government began a wider opening of the country's insurance market in the early 1990s. By the end of the decade, the government had granted licenses to a total of 16 companies—including such returning groups as Tai Ping Insurance Company and China Insurance Company. The increasingly competitive environment led to a need to change PICC's structure. In 1996, the company reorganized as a holding company, called PICC Group. Its operations were then broken up into three subsidiaries, PICC Life, PICC Property, and PICC Reinsurance. PICC Group initially operated under the control of the People's Bank of China.
Despite the restructuring, PICC Group was somewhat hampered in its growth. The arrival of AIG had introduced a new tied-agency system into the market, encouraging the development of branch networks. Yet PICC Group, as a state-owned enterprise, was initially barred from developing its own network of branch offices and tied agents. As a result, the company was forced to cede the leadership spot in two of the country's most important markets, Beijing, captured by Ping An, and Shanghai, taken by China Pacific.
In 1998, the Chinese government transferred oversight of the country's growing insurance market to a new body, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC). Under new rules, insurance companies were prohibited from operating in both the non-life and life insurance markets. As a result, PICC Group was broken up into its four primary components: PICC, which took over the company's general insurance business; China Re, for its reinsurance operations; China Insurance, which handled the group's international activities; and China Life. All four companies remained controlled by the Chinese state.
Yet the former members of PICC Group began moving toward an opening of its share capital at the beginning of the 2000s. In 2000, China Life announced its intention to diversify its own shareholding in advance of a future public offering. In the meantime, the company continued to build up its business across China, solidifying its dominant position in 29 of the country's 30 major markets. China Life also was helped by the government's rule for foreign corporations operating in China, which stipulated that all employees in these companies must be covered by unified insurance policies. In response, China Life concentrated its unified insurance operations at its Guangdong Branch, close to the rapidly expanding free-trade zone, in which the majority of foreign enterprises had set up their Chinese operations. By 2001, China Life had captured 80 percent of the unified insurance business for the top 500 foreign firms operating in China.
China Life then began petitioning the CIRC for authorization to go public, which was granted in June 2003. As part of the run up to the company's IPO, China Life restructured its operations, splitting into three entities: China Life Insurance Company and China Life Asset Management Company, both of which were placed under a new holding company, China Life Insurance Corporation.
In order to make its IPO more attractive, the parent holding transferred only long- and medium-term policies issued on or after June 10, 1999, to China Life. This move was made in order to avoid launching China Life with the burden of a large number of loss-making policies issued at return rates as high as 6.5 percent. The June 10, 1999 date corresponded to an emergency ruling by the CIRC, which lowered return rates to just 2.5 percent.
To attract as wide a pool of investors as possible, China Life launched its IPO on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange in December 2003. The IPO was a huge success, raising $3.5 billion and becoming the world's largest for that year. The retail offer had been oversubscribed by 172 times, and the total order had reached $80 billion.
The success of its IPO encouraged China Life to begin eyeing expansion into new markets in 2004. China Life's unlisted parent company announced its intention to diversify its insurance business to include property insurance and develop an insurance intermediary agent business as well as add other financial services. China Life itself announced its intention to diversify into new services, such as asset management, brokerage services, and banking in the near future. In the meantime, China Life had emerged as the dominant player in what many expected to become the world's fastest-growing and largest life insurance market.
Principal Competitors: Ping An Insurance Company Ltd.; China Pacific Insurance Company Ltd.; AIG; AIU Insurance Co.; Allianz Dazhong Life Insurance Company Ltd.; Chubb Group of Insurance Cos.; Cigna Corporation; Manulife-Sinochem Life Insurance Company Ltd.[5]
It became a public-listed company on December 18, 2003, with a market capitalization of US$5,756 million as of August 31, 2005. ¥832.5Billion was frozen during the IPO. The domestic listing, the first by an insurer in China, drew bids for about 49 times the stock on offer. The gains allow China Life to pass ING Group NV, Allianz SE and Axa to become the world's no. 2 insurer with a market value of $129 billion, behind American International Group's $186 billion. China Life is also listed in China since Jan of 2007.
In 2006, the new Executive Board put forward the conglomeration strategy of “being exceptionally strong in core businesses and appropriately diversified in operation”. At the end of 2006, China Life Property & Casualty Insurance Company Limited and China Life Pension Company Limited were successively established. Meanwhile, restructuring was basically accomplished on China Life Insurance (Overseas) Company Limited, China Life Investment Holding Company Limited and Insurance Professional College. By then, a group layout took initial shape through integration of life insurance, property & casualty insurance, corporate annuity, capital management, industrial investment and insurance education.
On January 9, 2007, the Life Company returned successfully to China A share market in Shanghai, thus making itself China's only financial insurer triple-listed home and abroad. With such unchallenged position, China Life further defined its goal to build itself into a world-class financial and insurance group by implementing the conglomeration strategy of “being exceptionally strong in core businesses and appropriately diversified in operation”. To realize the goal, China Life clarified a scientific roadmap with its own characteristics, and put forward the strategic requirements of comprehensively enhancing integrated operation and management capability. China Life has strived to make itself even bigger, stronger and better in a more appropriate and faster way. [6]
There is no business relationship between China Life Insurance Company in Mainland China and Taiwan.
3.02 billion yuan in illegal activities[edit]
China's audit office said it uncovered "improper and illegal activities" involving 3.02 billion yuan at two of the country's largest insurers, People's Insurance Co. of China Ltd. and China Life Insurance Co., during an audit of their 2009 books. They are charged with offences including the illegal sale of policies, overstating policy sales, improper claim settlements, illegal distributions of commissions and "grey income" - off-the-books gains, some of which company officials pocketed among themselves.
These violations have raised concern amongst some Chinese citizens over the authenticity and legality of the policies they currently hold. They are worried about where their money is going and what it is being used for. Without transparency, trust is quickly evaporating from businesses that are found to be conducting shady business.[7]

China Life Insurance Company Limited (short China Life, Chinese: 中国人寿保险; pinyin: Zhōngguó rénshòu bǎoxiǎn) is a Beijing-based China-incorporated company that provides life insurance and annuity products. China Life is ranked No. 94 on Fortune 2015 Global 500 Company list. [2] China Life, which is 70% state-owned, is the biggest life insurer in China, but is coming off a few rocky years. China's insurance market attracted dozens of new competitors after the Chinese government liberalized it, and China Life's market share has fallen by almost half since 2007, from 50% to around 26%, according to Morningstar. The company is completing a major restructuring, and the government assigned it a new CEO in 2014. A new sales push early this year (fueled by an army of newly hired agents) led to a big bump in net income in the first quarter of 2015. China Life is also ranked on Fortune China: 2015 Top 500 Chinese Enterprises at No.13.
China Life has more than 600,000 agents nationwide, making its cost of acquiring new customers relatively low. China Life has a substantial share of China's group life and health insurance business, and its government ties give it an inroad to help it build that business among state-owned enterprises.[3]
In 2015 China's government allowed Chinese insurance companies to invest in foreign real estate; China Life subsequently made its first such investment, in a Boston waterfront project. [4]

China Life Insurance Company Limited is the largest life insurer in the People's Republic of China. The company offers individual life insurance, group life, accident insurance, and health insurance policies. China Life commands 45 percent of that market, and holds the number one position in 29 of the country's 31 major markets—only Shanghai and Beijing, where the company nonetheless is number two, escape its dominance. Formed from the breakup of former government-owned monopoly People's Insurance Company of China, China Life is the only life insurance company in China with a national operating license, which has permitted it to develop a network of more than 8,000 field offices, 4,800 branch offices, 3,000 customer service offices, and 87,000 sales outlets in such locations as banks, post offices, hotels, airports, travel agents, and the like. The company's nearly 67,000 employees are complemented by a network of 650,000 exclusive independent sales agents. The company also operates a "one-stop" 24-hour telephone sales and service hotline. Together, China Life serves more than 100 million long-term policy holders and more than 150 million short-term policy holders, generating nearly CNY 51 billion ($6.2 billion) in net premiums and policy fees in 2003. The group's total sales topped $9.5 billion that year. China Life listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange at the end of 2003, raising $3.5 billion in that year's largest initial public offering (IPO). China has indicated its intention to expand into other financial areas, such as asset management, brokering, and banking.
Inheriting China's Pre-Revolution Insurance Industry The opening of China to the West in the early years of the 20th century led to a variety of new business opportunities. By the end of World War I, China, and especially Shanghai, had become a major center for international trade, although dominated by foreign interests. The lively commercial market in that city offered entrepreneurs seemingly unlimited potential; among these was the young C.V. Starr, an American, who founded an insurance agent's office in Shanghai in 1919. At first, Starr's company, American Asiatic Underwriters (AAU), served as a local representative for foreign insurers.
AAU originally dealt in fire and marine insurance policies. In the early 1920s, however, Starr recognized the vast potential for life insurance among the country's Chinese population. Starr set up a new company, Asia Life Insurance Company, which became the first to market life insurance products to the Chinese. The company's head start allowed it to build quickly into a leading insurance provider not only across the Chinese mainland, but throughout much of the Asian region. Starr's company eventually evolved into U.S. leader American Insurance Group. In the meantime, Asia Life's success inspired a raft of competitors. Most of these were local representatives of large foreign companies. A number of local groups appeared, however, and played an important role in developing the life insurance market among the indigenous population.
One of the earliest and most important of these companies was the Tai Ping Insurance Company, which was incorporated in Shanghai in 1929. Founded by Mr. H.N. Ting (Ting Hsieh Nung) with the help from the Chin Chen Bank Shanghai, the new company received start-up investments from a number of Chinese banks and began issuing general insurance policies. The following year, Tai Ping added a life insurance component, Tai Ping Life Insurance Company. Tai Ping developed strongly through the 1930s, adding nearly 20 branches in major cities in China as well as elsewhere in southeast Asia. The company also opened some 400 secondary offices across the Chinese mainland, before adding representative offices in Europe and in the Americas.
By the mid-1930s, Tai Ping had grown sufficiently large to become a member of the Shanghai Insurance Association, the only Chinese-owned company to be included in what had previously been an exclusive club for foreign insurers. Tai Ping's fortunes began to dwindle after the start of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and especially with the Mao-led Communist revolution in 1949.
Tai Ping in the meantime had been joined by a growing number of other Chinese-owned insurance companies. Among these were China Insurance Company, founded in 1931 in Shanghai, which opened a life insurance subsidiary, China Life Insurance Company in 1933. Later insurance market entries included Ming An Insurance Company, established in Hong Kong in 1949. By then, China boasted more than 240 insurance companies—some 180 of which were Chinese owned.
Following the revolution, the Mao government set up the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), which took over all insurance interests on the mainland. Tai Ping's leadership fled to Taiwan in 1950, reestablishing the company's operations there. Other companies, especially those that had set up foreign branches in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Saigon and elsewhere, withdrew from the mainland to rebuild their businesses around their foreign holdings. Foreign insurance companies were simply expelled outright, and their holdings regrouped under PICC as well.
At first the PICC monopoly continued to operate its various insurance services, integrating the assets of the former independent insurance sector. By 1952, PICC represented a national network of 1,300 branches and 3,000 agency outlets. Yet the Chinese government, in its effort to develop its regime, determined that insurance was superfluous in a state where the government was meant to provide for all social welfare for its citizens. In 1959, therefore, all domestic insurance business was ended. PICC's role was reduced to providing insurance covering the country's foreign policy needs, such as for the marine and aviation sectors. Following the reform, PICC was converted into a department of the government's central bank.
Reforming in the 1980s Economic reforms launched under Deng Xiaoping in 1978 paved the way to a rebirth in China's insurance sector. In 1979, the People's Insurance Company of China was separated from the central bank and reestablished as an independently operating, although state-controlled, company. In that year, PICC began offering general (i.e., non-life) insurance policies. In 1980, as the first initiatives to bring foreign investment capital in the country emerged, PICC formed a joint venture with American Insurance Group—allowing the American company to test the waters before making a broader return to the mainland insurance market in the 1990s.
PICC began offering life insurance policies again in 1982, targeting the small but growing numbers of middle-class and wealthy Chinese, as well as government officials. Nonetheless, the Chinese life insurance market remained tiny—as late as 2004, per capita spending on life insurance amounted to the equivalent of just $28, compared with average per capita spending of as much $2,800 or more in Japan, offering tantalizing prospects for future growth.
PICC officially retained its monopoly on the Chinese insurance market into the late 1980s. In 1988, however, the company's monopoly was abolished. Licenses were granted to the company's first competitors, including Ping An, which, established that year, grew into the country's second largest life insurer, with a dominance in the important Beijing market. Other early domestic competitors included China Pacific, based in Shanghai, which also started business in 1988, and American Insurance Group, which, in 1992, became the first foreign company to be granted a license to operate a self-standing business on the mainland (i.e., not as part of a joint venture with a local partner). Nonetheless, PICC remained the clear insurance champion on the mainland, with a strong national presence. The company also began opening offices overseas, adding locations in Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and London.
Public Company for the New Century The Chinese government began a wider opening of the country's insurance market in the early 1990s. By the end of the decade, the government had granted licenses to a total of 16 companies—including such returning groups as Tai Ping Insurance Company and China Insurance Company. The increasingly competitive environment led to a need to change PICC's structure. In 1996, the company reorganized as a holding company, called PICC Group. Its operations were then broken up into three subsidiaries, PICC Life, PICC Property, and PICC Reinsurance. PICC Group initially operated under the control of the People's Bank of China.
Despite the restructuring, PICC Group was somewhat hampered in its growth. The arrival of AIG had introduced a new tied-agency system into the market, encouraging the development of branch networks. Yet PICC Group, as a state-owned enterprise, was initially barred from developing its own network of branch offices and tied agents. As a result, the company was forced to cede the leadership spot in two of the country's most important markets, Beijing, captured by Ping An, and Shanghai, taken by China Pacific.
In 1998, the Chinese government transferred oversight of the country's growing insurance market to a new body, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC). Under new rules, insurance companies were prohibited from operating in both the non-life and life insurance markets. As a result, PICC Group was broken up into its four primary components: PICC, which took over the company's general insurance business; China Re, for its reinsurance operations; China Insurance, which handled the group's international activities; and China Life. All four companies remained controlled by the Chinese state.
Yet the former members of PICC Group began moving toward an opening of its share capital at the beginning of the 2000s. In 2000, China Life announced its intention to diversify its own shareholding in advance of a future public offering. In the meantime, the company continued to build up its business across China, solidifying its dominant position in 29 of the country's 30 major markets. China Life also was helped by the government's rule for foreign corporations operating in China, which stipulated that all employees in these companies must be covered by unified insurance policies. In response, China Life concentrated its unified insurance operations at its Guangdong Branch, close to the rapidly expanding free-trade zone, in which the majority of foreign enterprises had set up their Chinese operations. By 2001, China Life had captured 80 percent of the unified insurance business for the top 500 foreign firms operating in China.
China Life then began petitioning the CIRC for authorization to go public, which was granted in June 2003. As part of the run up to the company's IPO, China Life restructured its operations, splitting into three entities: China Life Insurance Company and China Life Asset Management Company, both of which were placed under a new holding company, China Life Insurance Corporation.
In order to make its IPO more attractive, the parent holding transferred only long- and medium-term policies issued on or after June 10, 1999, to China Life. This move was made in order to avoid launching China Life with the burden of a large number of loss-making policies issued at return rates as high as 6.5 percent. The June 10, 1999 date corresponded to an emergency ruling by the CIRC, which lowered return rates to just 2.5 percent.
To attract as wide a pool of investors as possible, China Life launched its IPO on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange in December 2003. The IPO was a huge success, raising $3.5 billion and becoming the world's largest for that year. The retail offer had been oversubscribed by 172 times, and the total order had reached $80 billion.
The success of its IPO encouraged China Life to begin eyeing expansion into new markets in 2004. China Life's unlisted parent company announced its intention to diversify its insurance business to include property insurance and develop an insurance intermediary agent business as well as add other financial services. China Life itself announced its intention to diversify into new services, such as asset management, brokerage services, and banking in the near future. In the meantime, China Life had emerged as the dominant player in what many expected to become the world's fastest-growing and largest life insurance market.
Principal Competitors: Ping An Insurance Company Ltd.; China Pacific Insurance Company Ltd.; AIG; AIU Insurance Co.; Allianz Dazhong Life Insurance Company Ltd.; Chubb Group of Insurance Cos.; Cigna Corporation; Manulife-Sinochem Life Insurance Company Ltd.[5]
It became a public-listed company on December 18, 2003, with a market capitalization of US$5,756 million as of August 31, 2005. ¥832.5Billion was frozen during the IPO. The domestic listing, the first by an insurer in China, drew bids for about 49 times the stock on offer. The gains allow China Life to pass ING Group NV, Allianz SE and Axa to become the world's no. 2 insurer with a market value of $129 billion, behind American International Group's $186 billion. China Life is also listed in China since Jan of 2007.
In 2006, the new Executive Board put forward the conglomeration strategy of “being exceptionally strong in core businesses and appropriately diversified in operation”. At the end of 2006, China Life Property & Casualty Insurance Company Limited and China Life Pension Company Limited were successively established. Meanwhile, restructuring was basically accomplished on China Life Insurance (Overseas) Company Limited, China Life Investment Holding Company Limited and Insurance Professional College. By then, a group layout took initial shape through integration of life insurance, property & casualty insurance, corporate annuity, capital management, industrial investment and insurance education.
On January 9, 2007, the Life Company returned successfully to China A share market in Shanghai, thus making itself China's only financial insurer triple-listed home and abroad. With such unchallenged position, China Life further defined its goal to build itself into a world-class financial and insurance group by implementing the conglomeration strategy of “being exceptionally strong in core businesses and appropriately diversified in operation”. To realize the goal, China Life clarified a scientific roadmap with its own characteristics, and put forward the strategic requirements of comprehensively enhancing integrated operation and management capability. China Life has strived to make itself even bigger, stronger and better in a more appropriate and faster way. [6]
There is no business relationship between China Life Insurance Company in Mainland China and Taiwan.
3.02 billion yuan in illegal activities[edit]
China's audit office said it uncovered "improper and illegal activities" involving 3.02 billion yuan at two of the country's largest insurers, People's Insurance Co. of China Ltd. and China Life Insurance Co., during an audit of their 2009 books. They are charged with offences including the illegal sale of policies, overstating policy sales, improper claim settlements, illegal distributions of commissions and "grey income" - off-the-books gains, some of which company officials pocketed among themselves.
These violations have raised concern amongst some Chinese citizens over the authenticity and legality of the policies they currently hold. They are worried about where their money is going and what it is being used for. Without transparency, trust is quickly evaporating from businesses that are found to be conducting shady business.[7]

China Life Insurance Company Limited (short China Life, Chinese: 中国人寿保险; pinyin: Zhōngguó rénshòu bǎoxiǎn) is a Beijing-based China-incorporated company that provides life insurance and annuity products. China Life is ranked No. 94 on Fortune 2015 Global 500 Company list. [2] China Life, which is 70% state-owned, is the biggest life insurer in China, but is coming off a few rocky years. China's insurance market attracted dozens of new competitors after the Chinese government liberalized it, and China Life's market share has fallen by almost half since 2007, from 50% to around 26%, according to Morningstar. The company is completing a major restructuring, and the government assigned it a new CEO in 2014. A new sales push early this year (fueled by an army of newly hired agents) led to a big bump in net income in the first quarter of 2015. China Life is also ranked on Fortune China: 2015 Top 500 Chinese Enterprises at No.13.
China Life has more than 600,000 agents nationwide, making its cost of acquiring new customers relatively low. China Life has a substantial share of China's group life and health insurance business, and its government ties give it an inroad to help it build that business among state-owned enterprises.[3]
In 2015 China's government allowed Chinese insurance companies to invest in foreign real estate; China Life subsequently made its first such investment, in a Boston waterfront project. [4]

China Life Insurance Company Limited is the largest life insurer in the People's Republic of China. The company offers individual life insurance, group life, accident insurance, and health insurance policies. China Life commands 45 percent of that market, and holds the number one position in 29 of the country's 31 major markets—only Shanghai and Beijing, where the company nonetheless is number two, escape its dominance. Formed from the breakup of former government-owned monopoly People's Insurance Company of China, China Life is the only life insurance company in China with a national operating license, which has permitted it to develop a network of more than 8,000 field offices, 4,800 branch offices, 3,000 customer service offices, and 87,000 sales outlets in such locations as banks, post offices, hotels, airports, travel agents, and the like. The company's nearly 67,000 employees are complemented by a network of 650,000 exclusive independent sales agents. The company also operates a "one-stop" 24-hour telephone sales and service hotline. Together, China Life serves more than 100 million long-term policy holders and more than 150 million short-term policy holders, generating nearly CNY 51 billion ($6.2 billion) in net premiums and policy fees in 2003. The group's total sales topped $9.5 billion that year. China Life listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange at the end of 2003, raising $3.5 billion in that year's largest initial public offering (IPO). China has indicated its intention to expand into other financial areas, such as asset management, brokering, and banking.
Inheriting China's Pre-Revolution Insurance Industry The opening of China to the West in the early years of the 20th century led to a variety of new business opportunities. By the end of World War I, China, and especially Shanghai, had become a major center for international trade, although dominated by foreign interests. The lively commercial market in that city offered entrepreneurs seemingly unlimited potential; among these was the young C.V. Starr, an American, who founded an insurance agent's office in Shanghai in 1919. At first, Starr's company, American Asiatic Underwriters (AAU), served as a local representative for foreign insurers.
AAU originally dealt in fire and marine insurance policies. In the early 1920s, however, Starr recognized the vast potential for life insurance among the country's Chinese population. Starr set up a new company, Asia Life Insurance Company, which became the first to market life insurance products to the Chinese. The company's head start allowed it to build quickly into a leading insurance provider not only across the Chinese mainland, but throughout much of the Asian region. Starr's company eventually evolved into U.S. leader American Insurance Group. In the meantime, Asia Life's success inspired a raft of competitors. Most of these were local representatives of large foreign companies. A number of local groups appeared, however, and played an important role in developing the life insurance market among the indigenous population.
One of the earliest and most important of these companies was the Tai Ping Insurance Company, which was incorporated in Shanghai in 1929. Founded by Mr. H.N. Ting (Ting Hsieh Nung) with the help from the Chin Chen Bank Shanghai, the new company received start-up investments from a number of Chinese banks and began issuing general insurance policies. The following year, Tai Ping added a life insurance component, Tai Ping Life Insurance Company. Tai Ping developed strongly through the 1930s, adding nearly 20 branches in major cities in China as well as elsewhere in southeast Asia. The company also opened some 400 secondary offices across the Chinese mainland, before adding representative offices in Europe and in the Americas.
By the mid-1930s, Tai Ping had grown sufficiently large to become a member of the Shanghai Insurance Association, the only Chinese-owned company to be included in what had previously been an exclusive club for foreign insurers. Tai Ping's fortunes began to dwindle after the start of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, and especially with the Mao-led Communist revolution in 1949.
Tai Ping in the meantime had been joined by a growing number of other Chinese-owned insurance companies. Among these were China Insurance Company, founded in 1931 in Shanghai, which opened a life insurance subsidiary, China Life Insurance Company in 1933. Later insurance market entries included Ming An Insurance Company, established in Hong Kong in 1949. By then, China boasted more than 240 insurance companies—some 180 of which were Chinese owned.
Following the revolution, the Mao government set up the People's Insurance Company of China (PICC), which took over all insurance interests on the mainland. Tai Ping's leadership fled to Taiwan in 1950, reestablishing the company's operations there. Other companies, especially those that had set up foreign branches in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Saigon and elsewhere, withdrew from the mainland to rebuild their businesses around their foreign holdings. Foreign insurance companies were simply expelled outright, and their holdings regrouped under PICC as well.
At first the PICC monopoly continued to operate its various insurance services, integrating the assets of the former independent insurance sector. By 1952, PICC represented a national network of 1,300 branches and 3,000 agency outlets. Yet the Chinese government, in its effort to develop its regime, determined that insurance was superfluous in a state where the government was meant to provide for all social welfare for its citizens. In 1959, therefore, all domestic insurance business was ended. PICC's role was reduced to providing insurance covering the country's foreign policy needs, such as for the marine and aviation sectors. Following the reform, PICC was converted into a department of the government's central bank.
Reforming in the 1980s Economic reforms launched under Deng Xiaoping in 1978 paved the way to a rebirth in China's insurance sector. In 1979, the People's Insurance Company of China was separated from the central bank and reestablished as an independently operating, although state-controlled, company. In that year, PICC began offering general (i.e., non-life) insurance policies. In 1980, as the first initiatives to bring foreign investment capital in the country emerged, PICC formed a joint venture with American Insurance Group—allowing the American company to test the waters before making a broader return to the mainland insurance market in the 1990s.
PICC began offering life insurance policies again in 1982, targeting the small but growing numbers of middle-class and wealthy Chinese, as well as government officials. Nonetheless, the Chinese life insurance market remained tiny—as late as 2004, per capita spending on life insurance amounted to the equivalent of just $28, compared with average per capita spending of as much $2,800 or more in Japan, offering tantalizing prospects for future growth.
PICC officially retained its monopoly on the Chinese insurance market into the late 1980s. In 1988, however, the company's monopoly was abolished. Licenses were granted to the company's first competitors, including Ping An, which, established that year, grew into the country's second largest life insurer, with a dominance in the important Beijing market. Other early domestic competitors included China Pacific, based in Shanghai, which also started business in 1988, and American Insurance Group, which, in 1992, became the first foreign company to be granted a license to operate a self-standing business on the mainland (i.e., not as part of a joint venture with a local partner). Nonetheless, PICC remained the clear insurance champion on the mainland, with a strong national presence. The company also began opening offices overseas, adding locations in Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and London.
Public Company for the New Century The Chinese government began a wider opening of the country's insurance market in the early 1990s. By the end of the decade, the government had granted licenses to a total of 16 companies—including such returning groups as Tai Ping Insurance Company and China Insurance Company. The increasingly competitive environment led to a need to change PICC's structure. In 1996, the company reorganized as a holding company, called PICC Group. Its operations were then broken up into three subsidiaries, PICC Life, PICC Property, and PICC Reinsurance. PICC Group initially operated under the control of the People's Bank of China.
Despite the restructuring, PICC Group was somewhat hampered in its growth. The arrival of AIG had introduced a new tied-agency system into the market, encouraging the development of branch networks. Yet PICC Group, as a state-owned enterprise, was initially barred from developing its own network of branch offices and tied agents. As a result, the company was forced to cede the leadership spot in two of the country's most important markets, Beijing, captured by Ping An, and Shanghai, taken by China Pacific.
In 1998, the Chinese government transferred oversight of the country's growing insurance market to a new body, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC). Under new rules, insurance companies were prohibited from operating in both the non-life and life insurance markets. As a result, PICC Group was broken up into its four primary components: PICC, which took over the company's general insurance business; China Re, for its reinsurance operations; China Insurance, which handled the group's international activities; and China Life. All four companies remained controlled by the Chinese state.
Yet the former members of PICC Group began moving toward an opening of its share capital at the beginning of the 2000s. In 2000, China Life announced its intention to diversify its own shareholding in advance of a future public offering. In the meantime, the company continued to build up its business across China, solidifying its dominant position in 29 of the country's 30 major markets. China Life also was helped by the government's rule for foreign corporations operating in China, which stipulated that all employees in these companies must be covered by unified insurance policies. In response, China Life concentrated its unified insurance operations at its Guangdong Branch, close to the rapidly expanding free-trade zone, in which the majority of foreign enterprises had set up their Chinese operations. By 2001, China Life had captured 80 percent of the unified insurance business for the top 500 foreign firms operating in China.
China Life then began petitioning the CIRC for authorization to go public, which was granted in June 2003. As part of the run up to the company's IPO, China Life restructured its operations, splitting into three entities: China Life Insurance Company and China Life Asset Management Company, both of which were placed under a new holding company, China Life Insurance Corporation.
In order to make its IPO more attractive, the parent holding transferred only long- and medium-term policies issued on or after June 10, 1999, to China Life. This move was made in order to avoid launching China Life with the burden of a large number of loss-making policies issued at return rates as high as 6.5 percent. The June 10, 1999 date corresponded to an emergency ruling by the CIRC, which lowered return rates to just 2.5 percent.
To attract as wide a pool of investors as possible, China Life launched its IPO on both the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange in December 2003. The IPO was a huge success, raising $3.5 billion and becoming the world's largest for that year. The retail offer had been oversubscribed by 172 times, and the total order had reached $80 billion.
The success of its IPO encouraged China Life to begin eyeing expansion into new markets in 2004. China Life's unlisted parent company announced its intention to diversify its insurance business to include property insurance and develop an insurance intermediary agent business as well as add other financial services. China Life itself announced its intention to diversify into new services, such as asset management, brokerage services, and banking in the near future. In the meantime, China Life had emerged as the dominant player in what many expected to become the world's fastest-growing and largest life insurance market.
Principal Competitors: Ping An Insurance Company Ltd.; China Pacific Insurance Company Ltd.; AIG; AIU Insurance Co.; Allianz Dazhong Life Insurance Company Ltd.; Chubb Group of Insurance Cos.; Cigna Corporation; Manulife-Sinochem Life Insurance Company Ltd.[5]
It became a public-listed company on December 18, 2003, with a market capitalization of US$5,756 million as of August 31, 2005. ¥832.5Billion was frozen during the IPO. The domestic listing, the first by an insurer in China, drew bids for about 49 times the stock on offer. The gains allow China Life to pass ING Group NV, Allianz SE and Axa to become the world's no. 2 insurer with a market value of $129 billion, behind American International Group's $186 billion. China Life is also listed in China since Jan of 2007.
In 2006, the new Executive Board put forward the conglomeration strategy of “being exceptionally strong in core businesses and appropriately diversified in operation”. At the end of 2006, China Life Property & Casualty Insurance Company Limited and China Life Pension Company Limited were successively established. Meanwhile, restructuring was basically accomplished on China Life Insurance (Overseas) Company Limited, China Life Investment Holding Company Limited and Insurance Professional College. By then, a group layout took initial shape through integration of life insurance, property & casualty insurance, corporate annuity, capital management, industrial investment and insurance education.
On January 9, 2007, the Life Company returned successfully to China A share market in Shanghai, thus making itself China's only financial insurer triple-listed home and abroad. With such unchallenged position, China Life further defined its goal to build itself into a world-class financial and insurance group by implementing the conglomeration strategy of “being exceptionally strong in core businesses and appropriately diversified in operation”. To realize the goal, China Life clarified a scientific roadmap with its own characteristics, and put forward the strategic requirements of comprehensively enhancing integrated operation and management capability. China Life has strived to make itself even bigger, stronger and better in a more appropriate and faster way. [6]
There is no business relationship between China Life Insurance Company in Mainland China and Taiwan.
3.02 billion yuan in illegal activities[edit]
China's audit office said it uncovered "improper and illegal activities" involving 3.02 billion yuan at two of the country's largest insurers, People's Insurance Co. of China Ltd. and China Life Insurance Co., during an audit of their 2009 books. They are charged with offences including the illegal sale of policies, overstating policy sales, improper claim settlements, illegal distributions of commissions and "grey income" - off-the-books gains, some of which company officials pocketed among themselves.
These violations have raised concern amongst some Chinese citizens over the authenticity and legality of the policies they currently hold. They are worried about where their money is going and what it is being used for. Without transparency, trust is quickly evaporating from businesses that are found to be conducting shady business.[7]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

 Simplest Process


Hassle-free and 2x faster!

If you have a family, you don’t need us to tell you how busy life can get. That’s why we’ve created a No-Hassle application for term life insurance coverage of $500,000 or less. We’ve stripped away a lot of the extra fuss and scheduling required by most other carriers.
In fact, most of our No-Hassle policies are issued in 15 days or less — that’s 2 times faster than the industry average!1








“SBLI made the process easy and quick and their customer service was wonderful. I would definitely recommend them.”



~ Alex,
Camden, Arkansas




See what our customers are saying
Because we work so hard to take the hassle out of buying life insurance, we tend to hear things like this from our customers:

 

Trustpilot

 

Choosing your coverage amount

How much coverage do you need?

Too little and you’ll want more later. Too much and you’re overpaying. Fortunately, you can find out how much coverage you need to fully protect your loved ones in seconds.



Employer-paid coverage may not be enough
Most employee life insurance only offers 1-2 years of salary. But two years will go by faster than you think. Plus, that coverage lapses as soon as you change jobs. So protect your family on your terms with your own life insurance policy.

Be sure to think ahead
Do you know how much your financial obligations may increase over time? Once you factor in child care, mortgages, college expenses, healthcare costs, debt and inflation, what you need today may not necessarily be what your family will need tomorrow. So when considering coverage amount, be sure to think ahead.

 
 




1More than half of all SBLI guaranteed level premium term life insurance applications, completed using our Accelerated Underwriting process, are issued in 15 days or less. According to the LOMA (Life Office Management Association) 2013 Individual Life STTA Report, the national average to issue a term life insurance policy is 30.1 days.

Final Expenses - Finding The Right Policy

Years in the industry taught me a few things about burial insurance. First, everyone needs it. Burial insurance is simply good business. Whether you have money in savings, life insurance, or think your family will be able to “pull the funds together” from your assets, you need a final expense policy. 
 
While we all know our death will come at some point, the events leading to our deaths are never clear. Will we be in a horrible accident? Will we face a long-term illness? Will our death be swift and unexpected? In any of these scenarios, the cash you have on hand could be needed in order for your family to survive until they can resume their lives. If your funds are frozen or utilized elsewhere, what will your family use to pay the mortgage, car payment or college tuition for the children? Without those funds, can they cover their basic life sustaining needs?
 
If you are involved in an accident, there is always the chance of legal action taken against your estate. This means legal fees, court dates, and uncertainty.  These are unexpected expenses which your family will have to deal with.
 
There are also final expenses that must be dealt with through probate. While this rarely involves life insurance, the funds you think your family has to live on can be seriously affected in some situations. 
 
What if your death was caused by illness? Most people think if they have medical insurance  they are covered. This is not always true. A disease such as cancer will push your medical insurance to the edge and then some. Here are some of the costs that can drain you financially even if you are well insured:
 

Co-pays
Out of pocket expenses
Maximum payment limits of your policy
Out of network providers (who may be the specialist you need)
Medications that your insurance may not cover
The cost of in-home equipment to assist you in moving, sleeping, bathing, and walking
The cost of having in-home nursing, adult care, therapy, and transportation

 
These are expenses that drain your financial situation, before your death!
So I need final expense insurance, what now?
In order for you to get the proper policy, you need to know a few things about the differences in insurance policies. Some people think they simply need to find a cheap life insurance policy and everything is covered. 
 
There are policies that are a whole life insurance policy (which require no medical exam). These policies are costly compared to other policies. You pay them an inflated rate every month and when you die, they cut a check to your beneficiary for the amount of money you chose. That person has the right to do whatever they choose to do with the money. They do not have to use it to take care of your final expenses, pay for your funeral, or anything else if they choose not to. (Burial insurance is “funeral insurance”. It is money designated to pay for your funeral, period.) 
 
Death insurance (sometimes called Accidental Death or Dismemberment insurance) is cheaper than life insurance. It pays your beneficiary in the event of an accident that causes your death. Like life insurance, it will pay your beneficiary a lump sum amount. But it only pays if you die as the result of an accident. This can be a stand-alone policy or can be added to some life insurance policies. If you are part of an industry where people are often hurt or killed in job-related accidents, it could be worth your while to get a death insurance quote. 
 
Final expenses insurance is a loving way to help your family in the event of your death. Final expense rates are among the lowest insurance costs. This policy pays your loved ones, allowing them to pay for funeral-related expenses that your family could be expected to pay for out of pocket. While you are shopping for the best policy to fill in the gaps in your life, you should absolutely get a final expenses quote. 
 
We all hope we will not face anything at the end of our life that undoes all we worked for. We all want our families to be able to grieve our deaths and move on with their lives. The idea of them struggling financially and going through this frustration and grief at the same time is heartbreaking. A little preparation now ensures a less painful transition for those we leave behind. The costs are low and the payoff is priceless.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
