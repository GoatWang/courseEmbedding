Multi-Family Developer – Dallas, TX
A great opportunity to preserve cash flow for my business.
I have always had great experiences when I have used Tax Ease. The transactions are timely, and the loan officer is quick to follow up to make sure everything is going as expected. Tax Ease offers a great opportunity to preserve cash flow for my business. Having a Spanish speaking loan officer helped make the process easy.
