Joseph Leonard Goldstein (born April 18, 1940) is an American biochemist. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1985, along with fellow University of Texas researcher, Michael Brown, for their studies regarding cholesterol.[3] They discovered that human cells have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood and that when LDL receptors are not present in sufficient numbers, individuals develop hypercholesterolemia and become at risk for cholesterol related diseases, notably coronary heart disease.[4] Their studies led to the development of statin drugs.[3]

Life and career[edit]
Goldstein was born in Kingstree, South Carolina, the son of Fannie (Alpert) and Isadore E. Goldstein, who owned a clothing store. Goldstein received his BSci from Washington and Lee University in 1962, and his MD from Texas University's Southwestern Medical School in 1966.[3] Upon completion of his residency, Goldstein moved to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where he worked in biochemical genetics.[5] In 1972, Goldstein relocated back to the Southwestern Medical Center, accepting a post as the head of the Division of Medical Genetics.[5]
At the Southwestern Medical Center Goldstein collaborated extensively with Michael Brown, a fellow researcher at the center who had also worked at the NIH.[5] From 1973 to 1985, Goldstein and Brown together published over one hundred major papers.[6] They are both listed in Thomson Reuters’ index of highly cited authors.[7] Frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationally-prominent positions in scientific administration, Goldstein, like his colleague Michael Brown, chose to continue hands-on research.[8][9]
In 1993, their postdoctoral trainees, Wang Xiaodong and Michael Briggs, purified the Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs), a family of membrane-bound transcription factors. Since 1993, Goldstein, Brown, and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery that proteolytically releases the SREBPs from membranes, thus allowing their migration to the nucleus where they activate all the genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. The machinery for generating active SREBPs is tightly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism, which explains how cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances.[10][11][12]
Goldstein is Chair, Molecular Genetics at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Together, Goldstein and Brown lead a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees. They have trained over 145 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and five of their former postdoctoral fellows (Thomas C. Südhof, Wang Xiaodong, Helen H. Hobbs, David W. Russell, and Monty Krieger) have been elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.[13] Former postdoctoral fellow Thomas Südhof received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology[14] and Helen H. Hobbs received the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.[15][16]
In 1988 Goldstein received a National Medal of Science in the field of molecular genetics,[17] and in 2003 Goldstein and Brown won the Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research in recognition for their further work in understanding cholesterol and also the discovery of an insulin-sensitive regulator, which potentially could be used to develop treatments for diabetes mellitus.[18] Goldstein is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences [19] and the Institute of Medicine[20] and he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1991.[2]
Goldstein was appointed as Chairman of the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards jury in 1995,[21] and was a recipient of the award ten years earlier.[22] Since 2000, Goldstein has authored a series of essays on the deep relationship between art and science that appear in the annual Nature Medicine supplement that accompanies the Lasker Awards.[23]
Among his professional activities, Goldstein is a member of the Board of Trustees of The Howard Hughes Medical Institute[24] and of The Rockefeller University, where he was elected as a Life Trustee in 2015.[25] He also serves as Chairman of the Board of Scientific Counselors of the Broad Institute,[26] and is a member of the Board of Directors of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[27] He previously served on The Board of Scientific Governors of the Scripps Research Institute, a nonprofit institute that conducts biomedical research.[28]

Joseph Leonard Goldstein (born April 18, 1940) is an American biochemist. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1985, along with fellow University of Texas researcher, Michael Brown, for their studies regarding cholesterol.[3] They discovered that human cells have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood and that when LDL receptors are not present in sufficient numbers, individuals develop hypercholesterolemia and become at risk for cholesterol related diseases, notably coronary heart disease.[4] Their studies led to the development of statin drugs.[3]

Life and career[edit]
Goldstein was born in Kingstree, South Carolina, the son of Fannie (Alpert) and Isadore E. Goldstein, who owned a clothing store. Goldstein received his BSci from Washington and Lee University in 1962, and his MD from Texas University's Southwestern Medical School in 1966.[3] Upon completion of his residency, Goldstein moved to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where he worked in biochemical genetics.[5] In 1972, Goldstein relocated back to the Southwestern Medical Center, accepting a post as the head of the Division of Medical Genetics.[5]
At the Southwestern Medical Center Goldstein collaborated extensively with Michael Brown, a fellow researcher at the center who had also worked at the NIH.[5] From 1973 to 1985, Goldstein and Brown together published over one hundred major papers.[6] They are both listed in Thomson Reuters’ index of highly cited authors.[7] Frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationally-prominent positions in scientific administration, Goldstein, like his colleague Michael Brown, chose to continue hands-on research.[8][9]
In 1993, their postdoctoral trainees, Wang Xiaodong and Michael Briggs, purified the Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs), a family of membrane-bound transcription factors. Since 1993, Goldstein, Brown, and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery that proteolytically releases the SREBPs from membranes, thus allowing their migration to the nucleus where they activate all the genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. The machinery for generating active SREBPs is tightly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism, which explains how cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances.[10][11][12]
Goldstein is Chair, Molecular Genetics at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Together, Goldstein and Brown lead a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees. They have trained over 145 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and five of their former postdoctoral fellows (Thomas C. Südhof, Wang Xiaodong, Helen H. Hobbs, David W. Russell, and Monty Krieger) have been elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.[13] Former postdoctoral fellow Thomas Südhof received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology[14] and Helen H. Hobbs received the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.[15][16]
In 1988 Goldstein received a National Medal of Science in the field of molecular genetics,[17] and in 2003 Goldstein and Brown won the Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research in recognition for their further work in understanding cholesterol and also the discovery of an insulin-sensitive regulator, which potentially could be used to develop treatments for diabetes mellitus.[18] Goldstein is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences [19] and the Institute of Medicine[20] and he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1991.[2]
Goldstein was appointed as Chairman of the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards jury in 1995,[21] and was a recipient of the award ten years earlier.[22] Since 2000, Goldstein has authored a series of essays on the deep relationship between art and science that appear in the annual Nature Medicine supplement that accompanies the Lasker Awards.[23]
Among his professional activities, Goldstein is a member of the Board of Trustees of The Howard Hughes Medical Institute[24] and of The Rockefeller University, where he was elected as a Life Trustee in 2015.[25] He also serves as Chairman of the Board of Scientific Counselors of the Broad Institute,[26] and is a member of the Board of Directors of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[27] He previously served on The Board of Scientific Governors of the Scripps Research Institute, a nonprofit institute that conducts biomedical research.[28]

Joseph Leonard Goldstein (born April 18, 1940) is an American biochemist. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1985, along with fellow University of Texas researcher, Michael Brown, for their studies regarding cholesterol.[3] They discovered that human cells have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood and that when LDL receptors are not present in sufficient numbers, individuals develop hypercholesterolemia and become at risk for cholesterol related diseases, notably coronary heart disease.[4] Their studies led to the development of statin drugs.[3]

Life and career[edit]
Goldstein was born in Kingstree, South Carolina, the son of Fannie (Alpert) and Isadore E. Goldstein, who owned a clothing store. Goldstein received his BSci from Washington and Lee University in 1962, and his MD from Texas University's Southwestern Medical School in 1966.[3] Upon completion of his residency, Goldstein moved to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where he worked in biochemical genetics.[5] In 1972, Goldstein relocated back to the Southwestern Medical Center, accepting a post as the head of the Division of Medical Genetics.[5]
At the Southwestern Medical Center Goldstein collaborated extensively with Michael Brown, a fellow researcher at the center who had also worked at the NIH.[5] From 1973 to 1985, Goldstein and Brown together published over one hundred major papers.[6] They are both listed in Thomson Reuters’ index of highly cited authors.[7] Frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationally-prominent positions in scientific administration, Goldstein, like his colleague Michael Brown, chose to continue hands-on research.[8][9]
In 1993, their postdoctoral trainees, Wang Xiaodong and Michael Briggs, purified the Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs), a family of membrane-bound transcription factors. Since 1993, Goldstein, Brown, and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery that proteolytically releases the SREBPs from membranes, thus allowing their migration to the nucleus where they activate all the genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. The machinery for generating active SREBPs is tightly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism, which explains how cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances.[10][11][12]
Goldstein is Chair, Molecular Genetics at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Together, Goldstein and Brown lead a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees. They have trained over 145 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and five of their former postdoctoral fellows (Thomas C. Südhof, Wang Xiaodong, Helen H. Hobbs, David W. Russell, and Monty Krieger) have been elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.[13] Former postdoctoral fellow Thomas Südhof received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology[14] and Helen H. Hobbs received the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.[15][16]
In 1988 Goldstein received a National Medal of Science in the field of molecular genetics,[17] and in 2003 Goldstein and Brown won the Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research in recognition for their further work in understanding cholesterol and also the discovery of an insulin-sensitive regulator, which potentially could be used to develop treatments for diabetes mellitus.[18] Goldstein is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences [19] and the Institute of Medicine[20] and he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1991.[2]
Goldstein was appointed as Chairman of the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards jury in 1995,[21] and was a recipient of the award ten years earlier.[22] Since 2000, Goldstein has authored a series of essays on the deep relationship between art and science that appear in the annual Nature Medicine supplement that accompanies the Lasker Awards.[23]
Among his professional activities, Goldstein is a member of the Board of Trustees of The Howard Hughes Medical Institute[24] and of The Rockefeller University, where he was elected as a Life Trustee in 2015.[25] He also serves as Chairman of the Board of Scientific Counselors of the Broad Institute,[26] and is a member of the Board of Directors of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[27] He previously served on The Board of Scientific Governors of the Scripps Research Institute, a nonprofit institute that conducts biomedical research.[28]

Joseph Leonard Goldstein (born April 18, 1940) is an American biochemist. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1985, along with fellow University of Texas researcher, Michael Brown, for their studies regarding cholesterol.[3] They discovered that human cells have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood and that when LDL receptors are not present in sufficient numbers, individuals develop hypercholesterolemia and become at risk for cholesterol related diseases, notably coronary heart disease.[4] Their studies led to the development of statin drugs.[3]

Life and career[edit]
Goldstein was born in Kingstree, South Carolina, the son of Fannie (Alpert) and Isadore E. Goldstein, who owned a clothing store. Goldstein received his BSci from Washington and Lee University in 1962, and his MD from Texas University's Southwestern Medical School in 1966.[3] Upon completion of his residency, Goldstein moved to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where he worked in biochemical genetics.[5] In 1972, Goldstein relocated back to the Southwestern Medical Center, accepting a post as the head of the Division of Medical Genetics.[5]
At the Southwestern Medical Center Goldstein collaborated extensively with Michael Brown, a fellow researcher at the center who had also worked at the NIH.[5] From 1973 to 1985, Goldstein and Brown together published over one hundred major papers.[6] They are both listed in Thomson Reuters’ index of highly cited authors.[7] Frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationally-prominent positions in scientific administration, Goldstein, like his colleague Michael Brown, chose to continue hands-on research.[8][9]
In 1993, their postdoctoral trainees, Wang Xiaodong and Michael Briggs, purified the Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs), a family of membrane-bound transcription factors. Since 1993, Goldstein, Brown, and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery that proteolytically releases the SREBPs from membranes, thus allowing their migration to the nucleus where they activate all the genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. The machinery for generating active SREBPs is tightly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism, which explains how cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances.[10][11][12]
Goldstein is Chair, Molecular Genetics at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Together, Goldstein and Brown lead a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees. They have trained over 145 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and five of their former postdoctoral fellows (Thomas C. Südhof, Wang Xiaodong, Helen H. Hobbs, David W. Russell, and Monty Krieger) have been elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.[13] Former postdoctoral fellow Thomas Südhof received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology[14] and Helen H. Hobbs received the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.[15][16]
In 1988 Goldstein received a National Medal of Science in the field of molecular genetics,[17] and in 2003 Goldstein and Brown won the Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research in recognition for their further work in understanding cholesterol and also the discovery of an insulin-sensitive regulator, which potentially could be used to develop treatments for diabetes mellitus.[18] Goldstein is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences [19] and the Institute of Medicine[20] and he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1991.[2]
Goldstein was appointed as Chairman of the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards jury in 1995,[21] and was a recipient of the award ten years earlier.[22] Since 2000, Goldstein has authored a series of essays on the deep relationship between art and science that appear in the annual Nature Medicine supplement that accompanies the Lasker Awards.[23]
Among his professional activities, Goldstein is a member of the Board of Trustees of The Howard Hughes Medical Institute[24] and of The Rockefeller University, where he was elected as a Life Trustee in 2015.[25] He also serves as Chairman of the Board of Scientific Counselors of the Broad Institute,[26] and is a member of the Board of Directors of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[27] He previously served on The Board of Scientific Governors of the Scripps Research Institute, a nonprofit institute that conducts biomedical research.[28]

Joseph Leonard Goldstein (born April 18, 1940) is an American biochemist. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1985, along with fellow University of Texas researcher, Michael Brown, for their studies regarding cholesterol.[3] They discovered that human cells have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood and that when LDL receptors are not present in sufficient numbers, individuals develop hypercholesterolemia and become at risk for cholesterol related diseases, notably coronary heart disease.[4] Their studies led to the development of statin drugs.[3]

Life and career[edit]
Goldstein was born in Kingstree, South Carolina, the son of Fannie (Alpert) and Isadore E. Goldstein, who owned a clothing store. Goldstein received his BSci from Washington and Lee University in 1962, and his MD from Texas University's Southwestern Medical School in 1966.[3] Upon completion of his residency, Goldstein moved to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where he worked in biochemical genetics.[5] In 1972, Goldstein relocated back to the Southwestern Medical Center, accepting a post as the head of the Division of Medical Genetics.[5]
At the Southwestern Medical Center Goldstein collaborated extensively with Michael Brown, a fellow researcher at the center who had also worked at the NIH.[5] From 1973 to 1985, Goldstein and Brown together published over one hundred major papers.[6] They are both listed in Thomson Reuters’ index of highly cited authors.[7] Frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationally-prominent positions in scientific administration, Goldstein, like his colleague Michael Brown, chose to continue hands-on research.[8][9]
In 1993, their postdoctoral trainees, Wang Xiaodong and Michael Briggs, purified the Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs), a family of membrane-bound transcription factors. Since 1993, Goldstein, Brown, and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery that proteolytically releases the SREBPs from membranes, thus allowing their migration to the nucleus where they activate all the genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. The machinery for generating active SREBPs is tightly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism, which explains how cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances.[10][11][12]
Goldstein is Chair, Molecular Genetics at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Together, Goldstein and Brown lead a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees. They have trained over 145 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and five of their former postdoctoral fellows (Thomas C. Südhof, Wang Xiaodong, Helen H. Hobbs, David W. Russell, and Monty Krieger) have been elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.[13] Former postdoctoral fellow Thomas Südhof received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology[14] and Helen H. Hobbs received the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.[15][16]
In 1988 Goldstein received a National Medal of Science in the field of molecular genetics,[17] and in 2003 Goldstein and Brown won the Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research in recognition for their further work in understanding cholesterol and also the discovery of an insulin-sensitive regulator, which potentially could be used to develop treatments for diabetes mellitus.[18] Goldstein is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences [19] and the Institute of Medicine[20] and he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1991.[2]
Goldstein was appointed as Chairman of the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards jury in 1995,[21] and was a recipient of the award ten years earlier.[22] Since 2000, Goldstein has authored a series of essays on the deep relationship between art and science that appear in the annual Nature Medicine supplement that accompanies the Lasker Awards.[23]
Among his professional activities, Goldstein is a member of the Board of Trustees of The Howard Hughes Medical Institute[24] and of The Rockefeller University, where he was elected as a Life Trustee in 2015.[25] He also serves as Chairman of the Board of Scientific Counselors of the Broad Institute,[26] and is a member of the Board of Directors of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[27] He previously served on The Board of Scientific Governors of the Scripps Research Institute, a nonprofit institute that conducts biomedical research.[28]

Joseph Leonard Goldstein (born April 18, 1940) is an American biochemist. He received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1985, along with fellow University of Texas researcher, Michael Brown, for their studies regarding cholesterol.[3] They discovered that human cells have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors that remove cholesterol from the blood and that when LDL receptors are not present in sufficient numbers, individuals develop hypercholesterolemia and become at risk for cholesterol related diseases, notably coronary heart disease.[4] Their studies led to the development of statin drugs.[3]

Life and career[edit]
Goldstein was born in Kingstree, South Carolina, the son of Fannie (Alpert) and Isadore E. Goldstein, who owned a clothing store. Goldstein received his BSci from Washington and Lee University in 1962, and his MD from Texas University's Southwestern Medical School in 1966.[3] Upon completion of his residency, Goldstein moved to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where he worked in biochemical genetics.[5] In 1972, Goldstein relocated back to the Southwestern Medical Center, accepting a post as the head of the Division of Medical Genetics.[5]
At the Southwestern Medical Center Goldstein collaborated extensively with Michael Brown, a fellow researcher at the center who had also worked at the NIH.[5] From 1973 to 1985, Goldstein and Brown together published over one hundred major papers.[6] They are both listed in Thomson Reuters’ index of highly cited authors.[7] Frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationally-prominent positions in scientific administration, Goldstein, like his colleague Michael Brown, chose to continue hands-on research.[8][9]
In 1993, their postdoctoral trainees, Wang Xiaodong and Michael Briggs, purified the Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs), a family of membrane-bound transcription factors. Since 1993, Goldstein, Brown, and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery that proteolytically releases the SREBPs from membranes, thus allowing their migration to the nucleus where they activate all the genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. The machinery for generating active SREBPs is tightly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism, which explains how cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances.[10][11][12]
Goldstein is Chair, Molecular Genetics at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Together, Goldstein and Brown lead a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees. They have trained over 145 graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and five of their former postdoctoral fellows (Thomas C. Südhof, Wang Xiaodong, Helen H. Hobbs, David W. Russell, and Monty Krieger) have been elected to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences.[13] Former postdoctoral fellow Thomas Südhof received the 2013 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology[14] and Helen H. Hobbs received the 2015 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences.[15][16]
In 1988 Goldstein received a National Medal of Science in the field of molecular genetics,[17] and in 2003 Goldstein and Brown won the Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research in recognition for their further work in understanding cholesterol and also the discovery of an insulin-sensitive regulator, which potentially could be used to develop treatments for diabetes mellitus.[18] Goldstein is a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences [19] and the Institute of Medicine[20] and he was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1991.[2]
Goldstein was appointed as Chairman of the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards jury in 1995,[21] and was a recipient of the award ten years earlier.[22] Since 2000, Goldstein has authored a series of essays on the deep relationship between art and science that appear in the annual Nature Medicine supplement that accompanies the Lasker Awards.[23]
Among his professional activities, Goldstein is a member of the Board of Trustees of The Howard Hughes Medical Institute[24] and of The Rockefeller University, where he was elected as a Life Trustee in 2015.[25] He also serves as Chairman of the Board of Scientific Counselors of the Broad Institute,[26] and is a member of the Board of Directors of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.[27] He previously served on The Board of Scientific Governors of the Scripps Research Institute, a nonprofit institute that conducts biomedical research.[28]

                           More than one-third of all deaths in the United States are caused by heart attacks. The disease begins early in life when
                              cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins from the bloodstream enter the lining of the artery and initiate an inflammatory process
                              that leads over many years to a blood clot that stops the circulation. Why does blood contain lipoprotein levels that are
                              high enough to trigger this inflammatory process? This lecture reviews the 33-year journey that Dr. Joseph Goldstein and Dr.
                              Michael Brown took to answer this question, starting at the bedside with a pair of 6- and 8-year-old siblings who had massively
                              elevated blood cholesterol levels and had suffered heart attacks. Their work fostered the development of statins, cholesterol-lowering
                              drugs that are now taken by more than 20 million people worldwide

                           More than one-third of all deaths in the United States are caused by heart attacks. The disease begins early in life when
                              cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins from the bloodstream enter the lining of the artery and initiate an inflammatory process
                              that leads over many years to a blood clot that stops the circulation. Why does blood contain lipoprotein levels that are
                              high enough to trigger this inflammatory process? This lecture reviews the 33-year journey that Dr. Joseph Goldstein and Dr.
                              Michael Brown took to answer this question, starting at the bedside with a pair of 6- and 8-year-old siblings who had massively
                              elevated blood cholesterol levels and had suffered heart attacks. Their work fostered the development of statins, cholesterol-lowering
                              drugs that are now taken by more than 20 million people worldwide

Joseph L. Goldstein

Joseph L. Goldstein (b. April 18, 1940) from Kingstree, South Carolina is a Nobel Prize winning biochemist and geneticist, and a pioneer in the study of cholesterol metabolism. 

 Biography
Dr. Goldstein received a BS in chemistry from Washington and Lee University in 1962 and his M.D. from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in 1966.  In 1985 he received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (together with Michael S. Brown) for his research on the metabolism of low density lipoprotein (LDL), and has won numerous other awards for his contributions related to genetic diseases.  
Returning to the University of Texas Health Science Center in Dallas in 1972 (now called  UT Southwestern Medical Center) Goldstein and his close colleague Brown  researched cholesterol metabolism and discovered that human cells have low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors that extract cholesterol from the bloodstream. The lack of sufficient LDL receptors is the cause of familial hypercholesterolemia, which predisposes heavily for cholesterol-related diseases.  In addition to explaining the underlying pathology of the widely-observed link between high levels of circulating cholesterol as LDL and coronary artery disease, their work uncovered a previously-unappreciated, yet fundamental, aspect of cell biology - Receptor-mediated endocytosis.  
In addition to contributing fundamentally to our understanding of how the cells in our bodies work, Drs. Goldstein and Brown's findings led to the development of statin drugs, the cholesterol-lowering compounds that today are used by 16 million Americans and are the most widely prescribed medications in the United States. This crucial discovery is improving more lives every year. New federal cholesterol guidelines are expected to triple the number of Americans taking statin drugs to lower their cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke for countless people.  Despite the well-known negative health effects of the typical American diet, statins may well render death by coronary artery disease a rare event in the not-too-distant future.  Subsequently the team lead by Drs. Brown and Goldstein elucidated the role of lipid modification of proteins (protein prenylation) in cancer. 
In 1984 he was awarded the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University together with Michael S. Brown (Co-winner of 1985 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine). 
In 1988, Goldstein also received National Medal of Science, a highly acclaimed honor in the scientific world in the U.S. 
In 1993, their postdoctoral trainees Xiaodong Wang and Michael Briggs purified the Sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs).  Since 1993, Drs. Goldstein, Brown, and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery  by which cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances.  
Dr. Goldstein is a Regental Professor of the University of Texas, holds the Julie and Louis A. Beecherl Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Science, and the Paul J. Thomas Chair in Medicine.  Frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationally-prominent positions in scientific administration, Dr. Goldstein, like his colleague Michael S. Brown, elects to continue hands-on involvement with research.  Together, they lead a research team that typically includes a dozen doctoral and postdoctoral trainees.  He and his colleague are among the most highly cited scientists in the world.  For a look at Dr. Goldstein's current research, check out the Brown and Goldstein Lab home.

Biography



Joseph L. Goldstein is currently Chairman of the Department of Molecular Genetics at UT Southwestern Medical Center. In 1985, he was named Regental Professor of the University of Texas. He also holds the Paul J. Thomas Chair in Medicine and the Julie and Louis A. Beecherl Distinguished Chair in Biomedical Science. Dr. Goldstein and his colleague, Michael S. Brown, discovered the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and worked out how these receptors control cholesterol homeostasis. At the basic level, this work opened the field of receptor-mediated endocytosis, and at the clinical level it helped lay the conceptual groundwork for development of drugs called statins that lower blood LDL-cholesterol and prevent heart attacks.
Drs. Goldstein and Brown shared many awards for this work, including the Lasker Award in Basic Medical Research (1985), Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (1985), and National Medal of Science (1988). In recent work, Drs. Goldstein and Brown discovered the SREBP family of transcription factors and showed how these membrane-bound molecules control the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids through a newly described process of Regulated Intramembrane Proteolysis. For this work, Drs. Brown and Goldstein received the Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research (2003).
Dr. Goldstein is currently Chairman of the Albert Lasker Medical Research Awards Jury and is a member of the Boards of Trustees of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and The Rockefeller University. He also serves on the Scientific Advisory Boards of the Welch Foundation, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Scripps Research Institute, Van Andel Institute, and the Massachusetts General Hospital. He is a member of the US National Academy of Sciences and a Foreign Member of the Royal Society.
