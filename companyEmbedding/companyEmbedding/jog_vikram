Fluidigm Corporation. (10/19/16). "Press Release: Fluidigm Names S. Christopher Linthwaite as New CEO". South San Francisco, CA.
Fluidigm Corporation (NASDAQ:FLDM) today announced that its Board of Directors has appointed S. Christopher Linthwaite as Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors, effective immediately.  Linthwaite succeeds Gajus V. Worthington, who has stepped down as the CEO and Board member of Fluidigm.

�We are thrilled to have Chris as a seasoned executive leading Fluidigm to the next phase of its growth,� commented Samuel Colella, Chairman of the Fluidigm Board of Directors.  �Also, we are very thankful for Gajus�s 18 years of service.  He has been a visionary leader for the company, delivering incredible market innovation and customer engagement.�

Linthwaite joined Fluidigm as President and Chief Operating Officer in August 2016.  A life sciences industry veteran, Linthwaite served as a senior business executive with Invitrogen, Life Technologies and Thermo Fisher Scientific.  His significant leadership experience in genomics, bioprocessing, forensics, AgBio, and animal health testing underpin a track-record of delivering profitable growth.

�Fluidigm is a highly innovative company with a passion for enabling new breakthroughs in life sciences research and applied markets, and I am honored to lead this remarkable organization,� Linthwaite said. �The opportunity ahead for Fluidigm is immense, and realizing it will require continued focus on customer-centric innovation combined with a commitment to operational excellence.  A key part of my role as CEO will be to achieve sustainable growth while delivering high-quality, innovative solutions to our customers. I look forward to spending time with our customers and stockholders later this quarter to discuss our performance and plans in more detail.�

Chris Linthwaite and Vikram Jog, Fluidigm�s Chief Financial Officer, will provide detailed information on third quarter financial performance after the close of the markets on Thursday, November 3, 2016.
