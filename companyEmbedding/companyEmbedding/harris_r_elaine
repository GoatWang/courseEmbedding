I have seen her for 20 years and she diagnosed a very difficult problem I had that could have very much affected my life long term. Yes, sometimes a longer wait time, but it's always because she takes time with each patient, rather than limiting to 1 problem and a quick in and out. Love and respect Dr Harris very much!Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted March 18, 2017 5Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeMy family and I love Dr.Harris !! She delivered our youngest son last year. We had a Doctor from that clinic deliver our middle son and it wasn`t the best experience. I highly recommend Dr.Harris and my Husband would back that up !! I wish she was our family doctor! She is very to the point about things! we are hoping for Dr.Harris or Dr.Peacock for this delivery *fingers crossed*Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted June 3, 2013 5Staff 4Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeI'm very lucky to have Dr. Eleanor Harris as my family doctor for more than 9 years. I find her very helpful, patience and knowledgeable to answer all my medical questions. I hope she is not retiring anytime soon, or else, I would be in trouble to find another good doctor like her.Was this rating useful? 0 Submitted August 3, 2011 4Staff 5Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5Knowledgebest GP around in Calgary. Always willing to take the time needed to make it personalWas this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted June 11, 2011 2Staff 2Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDr Elaine Harris has been a wonderful doctor to my family, she delivered my baby boy and was AMAZING. She has a fantastic sense of humour and always talks to me in a way that I understand rather then huge words that mean nothing to someone that is not a doctor. I was sad to hear that she was leaving and she would no longer be our family doctor, not to mention the fact that we were not told until I went to book an appointment for my very sick son. When I did call the staff spoke to me like I was stupid for not knowing. Either way, I am planning to expand my family and am hoping to have Dr Elaine Harris delivery my second child. Good luck Girl:)Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted December 6, 2010 4Staff 1Punctuality 1Helpfulness 1KnowledgeI have tried to give Dr Harris the benefit of the doubt but I am not able to do this any longer. If you get a morning appointment (first thing) her personality is great - however later in the day as her work load gets busier she is rude, and very unhelpful. I don't like going to a doctor that doesn't listen and certainly doesn't seem to have any concern for her patient. Perhaps if Dr. Harris didn't have so many patients she could give the ones that have been with her for 15 years a little more care.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted August 10, 2010 2Staff 2Punctuality 2Helpfulness 2KnowledgeThe reception is very cold in the office and Dr. Harris's workload seems to effect her personality and work ability - at times she is very personable while at others she is curt and quite rude. I have been mis-diagnosed by Dr. Harris on several occasions and have since found a new Doctor. Not a good experience.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted May 6, 2010 5Staff 4Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeWonderful Doctor. She has taken care of my daughter and I and throughout my pregnancy and I couldn't ask for a better doctor to take care of us!Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted April 9, 2010 3Staff 2Punctuality 2Helpfulness 2KnowledgeDo not recommend her. Seems very bored, rushed and apathetic towards her patients. Shows little concern or insight towards medical problems. I am searching for a new doctorWas this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted March 18, 2010 5Staff 2Punctuality 5Helpfulness 5KnowledgeDoctor Elaine is a fabulous Doctor. I went to her for 12 years. She delivered 2 of my 3 kids. She is very proactive in her practice. I will miss her greatly. When we found out that she was closing her family practice, I was devistated. I did find a new doctor by being proactive myself and having the office staff help me also. I just asked. Doctor Elaine has always be an outstanding doctor and I have huge expectations of my new doctor because of her. She never left me lingering, I often got phone calls later in the evening because a test came in that was not right. She will be dearly missed. I only wish her all the best. Anyone who gets her to deliver their baby is in excellent hands. You will love her. She has a good sence of humour and is easy to talk with. I trusted her with myself and my kids health care. Good Luck Doctor Elaine. I hope you have found what you were wanting. Trust me, you are missed with your family practice. All the best to you.Was this rating useful? 0 flag | Submitted January 14, 2010 Rate this DoctorDr. Elaine Harris's Credentials Facility AffiliationsNorton Rose FulbrightRockyview General Hospital48 reviews Accepting New PatientsUnavailable BiographyUnavailable LanguagesUnavailable EducationUnavailable Other SpecialtiesUnavailable Areas of ExpertiseUnavailable Awards & RecognitionsUnavailable Publications & ResearchUnavailableInsurance accepted by this DoctorOther patients have successfully used these insurance providers, please call the Doctor's office to find out if your insurance plan is accepted.Blue Cross / Blue Shield
