SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Schiff Nutrition International, Inc., (NYSE: WNI), acquired Airborne, 
      Inc., a leading provider of immune support products on March 30, 2012 
      for $150 million in cash, subject to certain adjustments.
    


      “Schiff is focused on building premium brands and leading innovation,” 
      stated Tarang Amin, president and chief executive officer. “We are 
      excited about the Airborne acquisition, which fits well with our 
      strategy and establishes Schiff as a leader in the immune support 
      segment. Airborne is a strong brand and will make an excellent addition 
      to Schiff’s portfolio, and we plan to leverage our science, innovation, 
      marketing and sales capabilities to further its growth.”
    

      Airborne develops and sells innovative dietary supplements throughout 
      the United States and Canada, as well as online. Its Airborne health 
      formula is designed to support customers’ immune systems through its 
      unique combination of vitamins, nutrients and proprietary blend of 
      herbal extracts. Its immune support products include iconic effervescent 
      tablets, new chewable tablets and on-the-go packets, all in a variety of 
      flavors. Airborne can be visited online at www.airbornehealth.com.
    

      Marti Morfitt, Airborne, Inc.’s chief executive officer, stated: “I am 
      very proud of the work the Airborne team has done over the past three 
      years to re-establish the growth of the brand and to develop a strong 
      pipeline of new products and marketing programs designed to support the 
      future growth of the business. We are happy to see our business move to 
      the team at Schiff – they bring great talent and resources to the 
      business and share our passion for building a leading immune support 
      brand.”
    

      “Schiff intends to couple Airborne’s leading brand and product portfolio 
      with our strong capabilities in science and innovation,” continued Amin. 
      “For example, there has been promising scientific research into the 
      potential relationship between BC30, the proprietary 
      probiotics technology we acquired rights to last year, and supporting 
      the immune system. We are currently conducting a study with Dr. Glenn R. 
      Gibson at The University of Reading in the UK on the effects of BC30 
      on the immune function of healthy elderly persons. This is but one of 
      the many potential opportunities to bring science and innovation to 
      Airborne.”
    

Terms of Deal and Financial Impact


      Under the terms of the purchase agreement, Schiff acquired 100% of 
      Airborne’s stock from GF Capital Private Equity Fund, LP for $150 
      million, subject to certain adjustments. Schiff funded the all-cash 
      transaction through a combination of a new debt facility and cash on its 
      balance sheet.
    

      Airborne, Inc. generated net revenue of approximately $70 million for 
      the twelve months ended February 29, 2012. Preliminarily, the company 
      expects to recognize transaction related costs of approximately $4.5 
      million in fiscal 2012, of which $0.9 million was recognized during the 
      third fiscal quarter.
    

      The transaction is expected to become accretive during the first half of 
      fiscal year 2014. The company is in the process of finalizing its 
      overall cost of capital, completing its valuation of the acquired 
      business, including allocation of purchase price to primarily intangible 
      assets, and determining the expected timing of certain synergies. 
      Management expects to further address the overall impact of the 
      acquisition on its financial results and future outlook when it 
      announces its fourth quarter and fiscal 2012 financial results.
    

      Houlihan Lokey acted as financial advisor to Schiff in connection with 
      the transaction.

      appropriately respond to changing consumer preferences and demand for 
      new products, the inability to gain or maintain market distribution for

      business recently acquired from Airborne), the inability to maintain or 
      attract key personnel, interruptions to our information technology 
      systems, control by our principal stockholders, and other factors

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
