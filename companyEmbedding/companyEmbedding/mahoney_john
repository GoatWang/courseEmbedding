As a commemorative boxed set  of the entire series of Frasier is released, here are five things you didn’t know about the show: Kelsey Grammer's 20-year reign makes Frasier Crane the joint longest-running TV character in the U.S. alongside James Arness as Marshal Matt Dillon in Gunsmoke. Grammer is the only actor to earn an Emmy nomination for playing the same role in three different shows — Cheers, Frasier and Wings. After 11 seasons and 264 episodes Frasier won 37 Emmys in total.British-born John Mahoney, 73, who played Frasier’s father, Marty, became the highest-paid British star on U.S. TV — by 2004, he was earning more than £400,000 an episode. Marty's beloved Jack Russell terrier was played by canine star Moose, who ‘wasn’t particularly friendly’ admits Mahoney. ‘When they wanted him to lick me, they’d put sardine oil on my face, and when they wanted him to lick Niles (David Hyde Pierce), they’d put liver pate behind his ears.’Callers to Frasier’s radio show were voiced by stars including Kevin Bacon, Billy Crystal, Stephen King and Halle Berry, while Sir Derek Jacobi and the late Bob Hoskins had small roles in front of camera.

[FREE] Sports Marketing EPUB
Sports Marketing presents this field as a new discipline, helping readers gain a stronger understanding of how to apply marketing strategies and tactics within the sports marketing environment. Sam Fullerton crafted this text to present the discipline of sports marketing in two broad perspectives.  The first part of the text provides an introduction to the field of sports marketing and examines how marketers use sports as a platform for developing their strategies and tactics.  The second part of the text provides detailed coverage of the marketing of sports products, increasing media audiences and live attendance, the selling of sports-related products, and more. This is not simply a basic marketing text using sports examples.  Sports Marketing fills a gap for this newly recognized course area by presenting a strong business perspective through its content.  It looks at the economic impact of the industry and identifies an array of career opportunities for students interested in sports marketing.  There is comprehensive coverage of how sports are used as a marketing platform and an abundance of real-world national and international examples to support the material.

no highlighting or marks in the book when i rented it.  fair price to rent a book at.  confusion as how/when to return the books to amazon but i figured it out by searching the help section.  should be easier to find but that doesnt affect the book.  order it if you need it.
