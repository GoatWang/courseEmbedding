BioSpecifics Technologies Corp. is a biopharmaceutical company that has developed injectable collagenase for twelve clinical indications to date. Injectable collagenase is marketed as XIAFLEX® in the U.S. for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease by BioSpecifics' partner, Endo International plc (Endo). XIAFLEX® is also commercialized in Japan, Europe, Canada and Australia for Dupuytren’s contracture and also for Peyronie's disease in Europe and Australia.
Endo has the following partnerships outside the U.S. for these two indications; Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB has marketing rights for Xiapex® (the European tradename for XIAFLEX) in certain Eurasian countries and Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation has marking rights in Japan. Sobi is selling Xiapex in Europe for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease. Asahi is selling XIAFLEX for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture in Japan. The XIAFLEX research and development pipeline includes several additional promising indications. Endo is currently managing development for Dupuytren's nodules, cellulite, adhesive capsulitis, human and canine lipoma, lateral hip fat and plantar fibromatosis. BioSpecifics is managing the development of CCH for uterine fibroids and initiated its Phase 1 clinical trial in the second quarter of 2017.

Uterine Fibroids

PipelineDupuytren's ContracturePeyronie's DiseaseAdhesive CapsulitisLipomaCelluliteUterine FibroidsAdditional Indications









Uterine fibroids are benign tumors that form in the reproductive tract and contain large amounts of collagen which cause pelvic discomfort and pain, decreased fertility, pregnancy complications, miscarriage, heavy bleeding and frequent urination. Uterine fibroids are the primary indication for hysterectomy in the U.S., accounting for approximately 200,000 hysterectomies and 30,000 myomectomies each year. There are up to a $9.4 billion in annual direct costs (surgery, hospital admissions, outpatient visits, medications).
BioSpecifics supported preclinical research with highly purified collagenase as an early step in the potential treatment for uterine fibroids. Studies at Duke Medicine indicate that the use of highly purified collagenase can reduce the stiffness of human uterine fibroid tissue in laboratory experiments. Increased tissue rigidity has been implicated as a cause of the morbidity associated with uterine fibroids. Laboratory research shows that treatment of fibroids with determined doses of purified collagenase causes a statistically significant decrease in the stiffness or the tissue and suggests that XIAFLEX could potentially be a minimally invasive treatment for this condition.
In October 2014, promising preclinical data from this collaborative study with Duke Medicine were presented at the Mechanotransduction in the Reproductive Tract conference. The data demonstrated that XIAFLEX can reduce the rigidity of human uterine fibroid tissue, potentially shrink uterine fibroid tumors and lend further support to continued research on the potential treatment of XIAFLEX in uterine fibroids.
In May 2016, BioSpecifics announced the publication of data highlighting the efficacy of collagenase clostridium histolyticum (CCH) for the treatment of uterine fibroids in the May 2016 issue of the American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology in an article titled, "Loss of Stiffness in Collagen-Rich Uterine Fibroids after Digestion with Purified Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum." The data show that highly purified CCH can reduce the stiffness of human uterine fibroids ex-vivo and potentially decrease their size.
In March 2017, the potential use of XIAFLEX for the treatment of uterine fibroids was highlighted at the Uterine Fibroids 2017 Conference: A Case for Women's Health Conference, in Durham, NC. The investigator, Dr. James Segars, Director of Reproductive Science and Women's Health Research at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, presented data in a presentation titled, "An Injectable Drug to Treat Fibroids: A Phase 1 clinical trial," demonstrating accuracy of the injection technique in three patients.
BioSpecifics has developed a clinical protocol with investigators from John Hopkins for a pilot safety and tolerability study in this indication and a Phase 1 clinical trial was initiated in the second quarter of 2017. The Phase 1 open-label dose escalation study in fifteen female subjects treated prior to hysterectomy is taking place at the Department of Gynecology & Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University. Three subjects have been injected with saline to evaluate the accuracy of the injection method prior to the first patient being dosed with XIAFLEX, 12 subjects will receive XIAFLEX. The primary endpoint will assess the safety and tolerability of CCH following a one-time injection directly into uterine leiomyomas at three doses under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The secondary endpoints will assess symptoms of pain and bleeding, quality of life throughout the study, shrinkage of CCH treated fibroids in size, increased rates of apoptosis in treated fibroids and the collagen content of treated fibroids.

Dupuytren's Contracture










In this section...
PipelineDupuytren's ContracturePeyronie's DiseaseAdhesive CapsulitisLipomaCelluliteUterine FibroidsAdditional Indications









Dupuytren's contracture is a deforming condition of the hand in which one or more fingers contract toward the palm, often resulting in physical disability. The onset of Dupuytren's contracture is characterized by the formation of nodules in the palm that are composed primarily of collagen. As the disease progresses, the collagen nodules begin to form a cord causing the patient's finger(s) to contract, making it impossible to open the hand fully. This disease has a debilitating effect on quality of life, and patients often complain about their inability to perform necessary daily activities like washing their hands, wearing gloves or grasping objects. Dupuytren's contracture has a genetic basis and is most prevalent in individuals of northern European ancestry.
XIAFLEX® is the first and only FDA- and EMA-approved nonsurgical treatment for Dupuytren's contracture patients with a palpable cord.

Data from Year 3 of CORDLESS (Collagenase Optimal Reduction of Dupuytren's - Long-term Evaluation of Success Study) indicate that 87.2% of joints that achieved clinical success from XIAFLEX did not require further surgery or medical intervention. Additionally, a surveillance study based on three years of post-approval use of XIAFLEX indicates a safety profile with no clinically meaningful changes relative to the one year results. Adverse events were the most commonly localized, non-serious reactions to the injections.

Canine lipomas are encapsulated fat deposits that occur under the skin and affect 1.7 million dogs in the U.S. BioSpecifics anticipates that it will complete this study in the first half 2013. “We are happy to report the initiation of Chien-804 as we believe there is strong potential for injectable collagenase in the treatment of lipomas in canines and a high interest among veterinarians in the product to treat this condition,” said Thomas Wegman, President of BioSpecifics. “Canine lipomas represent a large market opportunity, with 1 million potential injections in the U.S. annually. In addition, we look forward to the initiation of our Phase II dose escalation clinical trial of XIAFLEX for human lipomas shortly.”This single injection study will evaluate 32 dogs randomized 1:1 XIAFLEX to placebo. The lipoma volume will be measured at baseline, 1 month and 3 months.The primary efficacy endpoint is the relative change from baseline for lipoma volume at the 3 month visit as determined by CT scan. The secondary efficacy endpoints include an analysis of responders at 1 month and 3 months. A responder is defined as a canine with a ≥50% decrease in the volume of the lipoma under study relative to baseline as measured by CT scan. The additional secondary efficacy endpoints are the relative change from baseline for lipoma volume at the 1 month visit as determined by CT scan, relative change from baseline for lipoma surface area at the 1 month and 3 month visits as determined by caliper measurements, lipoma texture and hardness and dog owner satisfaction as determined from a questionnaire. The study is being conducted at the California Veterinary Specialists, Carlsbad Hospital and is being led by investigator Sarit Dhupa, DVM, BVSc. Dr. Dhupa is a Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Surgeons. California Veterinary Specialists is one of the nation’s leading providers of advanced veterinary services for animals in need of critical emergency care and treatment of serious acute and chronic illnesses.BioSpecifics’ partner, Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Auxilium), has the option to license development and marketing rights to this indication, which would trigger an opt-in payment and potential future milestone payments from Auxilium to BioSpecifics.About Chien-802 Clinical TrialPrior to the initiation of Chien-804, BioSpecifics conducted the Chien-802 trial, which was an open label trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of injectable collagenase in canine lipoma in healthy dogs with subcutaneous lipomas. Inclusion criteria required the lipoma to be benign, superficial and easily measureable. All dogs had a second lipoma that was untreated and used as a control. At 3 months post-injection, the lipoma size in the three evaluable dogs was reduced to 0%, 0% or 7% of the original size as measured by a CT scan. By contrast, the untreated lipomas were 129%, 113% and 128% of the original size at day 90. Thus, the treated lipomas showed on average a 97% reduction in the size of the lipoma versus an increase on average in the size of the untreated controls of 23%.About Canine LipomasLipomas are encapsulated fat deposits that occur under the skin. Lipomas restrict motion in older dogs, and surgical excision of the lipoma is the only proven therapy. Surgical excision requires the use of general anesthesia and it has been estimated that up to 2% of sick dogs die as a complication of general anesthesia.1 Lipomas occur in 2.3% of the dog population2 or in approximately 1.7 million dogs in the U.S.3About BioSpecifics Technologies Corp. BioSpecifics Technologies Corp. is a biopharmaceutical company that has developed injectable collagenase for twelve clinical indications. Today, injectable collagenase, registered as XIAFLEX®, is marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture in adults with a palpable cord by the Company’s partner Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Auxilium) and is marketed in Europe under the trademark XIAPEX® by Pfizer Ltd. (Pfizer). XIAFLEX will be tested in the clinic for six promising indications during 2012: Auxilium is developing XIAFLEX for the treatment of Peyronie's disease, which is currently in Phase III pivotal clinical trials, as well as for frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) and cellulite, which are in Phase II and Phase I, respectively. Auxilium is also conducting a Phase IIIb trial of XIAFLEX for Dupuytren's contracture patients with multiple palpable cords. BioSpecifics is developing XIAFLEX for human and canine lipomas. Pfizer has development and commercialization rights for XIAPEX for Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease in the 27 European Union member countries and 19 other European and Eurasian countries. Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation has development and commercialization rights for XIAFLEX for the same two indications in Japan, and Actelion Pharmaceuticals has development and commercialization rights for XIAFLEX for these two indications in Canada, Australia, Brazil and Mexico.

BioSpecifics Technologies Corp. Initiates Phase 1 Clinical Trial of XIAFLEX for Treatment of Uterine Fibroids
Apr 18, 2017




LYNBROOK, N.Y., April 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- BioSpecifics Technologies Corp. (NASDAQ: BSTC), a biopharmaceutical company that originated and continues to develop collagenase based-therapies with a first in class collagenase-based product marketed as XIAFLEX® in the U.S. and Xiapex® in Europe, today announced that it has initiated an open-label, dose escalation Phase 1 clinical trial of XIAFLEX for the treatment of uterine fibroids. 



"The treatment of our first patient in this trial for uterine fibroids is an important milestone for BioSpecifics and supports our business objective to develop XIAFLEX for medically necessary indications," commented Thomas L. Wegman, President of BioSpecifics. "We believe there are strong benefits to XIAFLEX as a potential non-surgical treatment for uterine fibroid patients and that achieving a reduction in the size and stiffness of the fibroids will decrease symptoms of pain and bleeding, avoid the need for surgical procedures and result in a better quality of life for affected women." 
The Phase 1 open-label dose escalation study is being conducted at the Department of Gynecology & Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University and will enroll 15 female subjects treated prior to hysterectomy. Three subjects have been injected with saline only to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the injection method and the remaining 12 subjects will now be injected with increasing doses of XIAFLEX. The primary endpoint will assess the safety and tolerability of a single injection of XIAFLEX directly into the uterine fibroids at three doses under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The secondary endpoints will assess symptoms of pain and bleeding, quality of life throughout the study, shrinkage of XIAFLEX treated fibroids in size, increased rates of apoptosis in treated fibroids and a decrease in the collagen content of treated fibroids. 
About Uterine Fibroids Uterine fibroids are very common benign tumors in the reproductive tract that contain large amounts of collagen which may cause pelvic discomfort and pain, decreased fertility, pregnancy complications, an increased rate of miscarriage, uterine bleeding, prolonged menstrual bleeding and frequent urination. Uterine fibroids are the leading cause of hysterectomies in the U.S., accounting for about 250,000 hysterectomies and 30,000 myomectomies performed each year. Uterine fibroids have been estimated to cost up to $9.4 billion annually in direct costs in the U.S. and there is a high level of recurrence with current treatment options.
About BioSpecifics Technologies Corp. BioSpecifics Technologies Corp. is a biopharmaceutical company that has developed injectable collagenase for twelve clinical indications to date. Injectable collagenase is marketed as XIAFLEX® in the U.S. for the treatment of Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease by BioSpecifics' partner, Endo International plc (Endo). XIAFLEX® is also commercialized in Japan, Europe, Canada and Australia for Dupuytren's contracture and for Peyronie's disease in Europe and Australia. Endo is partnered with Sobi, Actelion and Asahi Kasei for Dupuytren's contracture and Peyronie's disease outside the U.S. The XIAFLEX research and development pipeline includes several additional promising indications. BioSpecifics is managing the development of XIAFLEX for uterine fibroids and is conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial. For more information, please visit www.biospecifics.com.
