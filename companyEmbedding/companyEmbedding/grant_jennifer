Product DescriptionEvery child wonders where God lives or what God is like. In Maybe God Is Like That Too, a young boy asks his grandma where God is in their city. She invites him to pay attention to where he sees the fruit of the Spirit. Where love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control are, there too is God. The boy sees God in the kindness of a doorman holding the door for a man using a wheelchair, in the patience of his teacher helping him tie his shoes, and in the love, faithfulness, and gentleness of his grandma. An ordinary day in his city opens this young boy's eyes to God's Spirit at work all around him.More Product InformationPublisher: Sparkhouse Family

Publisher's Description▼▲
Celebrating the joyous art of being a mother, MOMumental offers an inspiring, honest, and infectiously humorous look at the perils and pleasures of raising a family in the real world.Once a devout believer in the myth of the perfect mother, author Jennifer Grant now has a more realistic yet still upbeat view of parenting and families. Instead of focusing on creating a conflict-free home, raising picture-perfect kids, and being an ideal mother, Grant offers a wiser and more down-to-earth way to love your children that makes room for mistakes and imperfections. She says, "I share stories about family life and how Ive come to appreciate the mess of it. I am grateful for my own happy, idiosyncratic, and imperfect family."MOMumental is one mothers account of the unpredictable, creative, sometimes hilarious, and always rewarding process of raising a family. Its filled with funny and poignant stories from her everyday lifea life that mothers everywhere can identify with.MOMumental is a book about parenting, family, and intentional relationships for readers who normally avoid such fare like an overzealous street evangelist. (Raises hand.) Its wit and wisdom completely enraptured me. A delightful and surprising gift to us all.Cathleen Falsaniaward-winning journalist and author 


About the Author▼▲
Jennifer Grant is mother to four children and author of Love You More: The Divine Surprise of Adopting My Daughter (2011).  For more than a decade she wrote for the Chicago Sun-Times.  Currently she writes a column and features for the Chicago Tribune.  Grant is a Wheaton College graduate who received her Masters in English and Creative Writing from SMU.  She lives in Chicago, IL.

Jennifer Grant's "Velveteen Parenting" Guidelines▼▲

Choose your battles. 
Develop priorities in your family's life, such as treating each other with respect, eating together whenever possible, and attending church together. 
Ask questions such as, "What do I want our family to be like? What are our individual gifts and perspectives? What connects us as a family and brings us joy?" 
Remind yourself that children are not mini-adults, but are uniquely suited to grow, learn, and enjoy life in ways that many of us adults don't remember. Look with a critical - and often delighted - eye at what the culture is dishing up to your children. Teach your children to do the same. 
Don't be so hard on yourself. Moms often judge themselves too harshly and then are quick to judge and label other mothers who are fumbling along just like they are.

            It has been my experience that most parenting books want to tell you that your baby or child must do: A, B, C. And to do this, as the parent, you must do: X, Y, Z. If it fails, then you must assume that you are doing something wrong.


I learned during my early days of parenting that these books aren't worth the paper they're printed on.


However, if you're looking for guidance in the parenting department, starting with MOMumental is not a bad idea. This book is different. It's a lighthearted, humorous view on parenthood (because, really, there are time we have to laugh to stop us from crying). And Ms. Grant quickly become an ally in parenting. This is not another 'mom vs. mom' fire ignite (think Time magazine) or someone spouting off a list of dos and don'ts. Instead, Grant is a mom who has been there, lived through the early years of parenthood with a handful of kids, and is here to tell us that the feelings and thoughts we have, especially in the early years, are normal. And we will survive.


Grant does not paint herself as a perfect parent. Oh, she did have dreams of being a perfect parent, especially as a child. Her childhood, being raised in a single parent home after her parent divorced and her dad fell out of the picture, led her to have a fantasy about her future life with her future family. The reality is a much different life than the envisioned future of a young girl living through a family torn apart. But Grand is quick to remind us that reality does not equate "bad." Parenthood may not be easy, but it can turn out okay.


I'm usually hesitant about reading "parenting" or "mom" books I'm happy I gave this one a chance. In a world where moms have to be perfect with perfect children or face the harshness of other moms and society in general, MOMumental is a breath of fresh air. It is a reminder that no mom or dad is prefect and that we will make mistakes. Grant also reminds us that we shouldn't feel guilty of these mistakes because most will not have any long term effects upon the children. Having a fantasy family is just that--a fantasy. But with hard work, and some stumbles along the way, we can create something wonderful within our family. And reading Grant's book is like sitting around with your girlfriends over a cup of coffee, sharing your parenting dirt with sympathetic compassion instead of condemnation.

            I wasn't really looking for another book on parenting to review as I've received several of these in the last while. However, when I was given the opportunity to read MOMumental: Adventures in the Messy Art of Raising a Family by Jennifer Grant, I jumped at the chance. My parenting leans heavily toward the messy side and I have found parenting to be one adventure after another - how could I resist such a book?


Grant opens the door to her life as a mother raising four children and honestly shares her struggles and successes. I particularly appreciated how she directs the focus toward being more intentional with our children. This has been a recurring theme in my life and it is great to have it reinforced again. Life happens at such a frantic pace, and I have found many parents who are struggling to remember to stop and live "in the moment" with their children.


The writing is conversational and casual, and the chapters are short enough to read during quiet moments snatched throughout the day. Grant gently guides the reader to remember God's grace in their parenting and challenges parents to keep God as the primary focus in their children's lives. She even includes a prayer from the Episcopalian Book of Common Prayer for parents to rip out of the back of the book and post on the fridge.


MOMumental is not so much a how-to book as it is an encouraging and comforting story of one mom trying her best and getting it right, and a challenge for us to do the sameÃ¢â¬âall while getting messy and loving the adventure.


I give this book 5 stars out of 5.


I received this book free from Worthy Publishing. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

            Momumental is a well-written, smoothly flowing book that will have you smiling, laughing, and nodding along with the author in agreement with her bang-on assessment of life and the joys and pitfalls of parenting. Jennifer Grant has written a treasure, a book that assures parents, and obviously moms in particular, that it's okay not to be perfect and that they are not alone. I utterly appreciated Grant's ability to speak to the reader in a manner that makes you feel like you are sitting down having coffee with her and comparing notes on the craziness and beauty of guiding the next generation. The book is chock-full of wisdom, yet it is delivered with such wit and realness and in such a non-judgemental manner that you cannot help but soak it up and think about how you could apply it to your own life. What I most take away is the assurance that despite our mistakes, that as we parent our children with love "our children will keep growing and changing, becoming more independent, more empathetic, more the people God has created them to be". Sometimes it's easy to forget that we are not parenting alone, but that God is right there along side us and that he has an even better plan than we do for their lives. I thank the author for the courage in sharing so much of her life with us readers, and blessing us in the process.


I strongly recommend this book and give it a rating of 4.5 out of 5 stars.

                This review was written for MOMumental: Adventures in the Messy Art of Raising a Family - eBook.
            
 
            Jennifer Grant shares her perspective and her stories on motherhood and raising a family. Let me share with you a few sentences.


These days, instead of focusing on creating a conflict-free home, raising picture-perfect kids, and being an ideal mother-comprised of equal parts of June Cleaver, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Angelina Jolie- I have embraced a more realistic view of what I can and cannot do as a parent. this reality-based, "Velveteen parenting", includes, but is not limited to, the following general guidelines:"


After reading this statement and adding Angelina Jolie into the women as ideal mothers, she totally lost me. I was a bit let down as I read this book. I was expecting more and was left feeling a little empty as I closed the last page.


What did I take away from these pages? It's okay that we are not perfect parents. No matter how much we try it just simply isn't going to happen. God's grace washes over us and the more we can draw near to Him the better people we truly are. The most important lesson is not to compare yourself to another. We take the good, the bad and the ugly and reach for God's grace.


Jennifer Grant shares humorous stories about her family and does give some good advice throughout the book, but for the most part, it just wasn't for me. You may pick up this book and just love it and soak in the words and gain great insight. Remember, this is just my thoughts about the book.


This book was a gift from Worthy Publishers for it's review.

Publisher's Description▼▲
A Stirring Memoir on Parenthood and the Invisible Threads that Bind Us to Those We Are Meant to Love The obstacles, surprises, and moments of grace that Jennifer Grant experienced, working through the adoption process to bring home her daughter from Guatemala, forever changed her life. Love You More tells Grants deeply personal story of adopting her daughter, Mia. The process confronted her notions about what family means, pushed her into uncomfortable places, anddespite the waiting, adjustments, and challenges of a blended familybrought abiding joy. Written for all parents but especially those interested in adoption, Love You More includes discussion questions, tips for prospective adoptive parents, and suggestions for readers on how to reach out in love and support for the worlds most vulnerable people, including orphans.  From page one of her courageously vulnerable, intoxicatingly funny memoir about faith and family, Jennifer Grant finds the God of grace in each pot of macaroni and cheese, sticky little hand, doctors visit, late-night lawn mowing, and unlikely friend-turned-family-member that decorate her life.Cathleen Falsani, author, Sin Boldly So much written about adoption seems to overlook this essential truth: adoption is about love. Jennifer Grants story demonstrates this in every sentence and paragraph and on every page. She tells a story that is smart, funny, and brutally honest.Jessica ODwyer, author, Mamalita

            Jennifer Grant beautifully tells the story of her family's journey to adoption-She shares what it was like adopting from another country, I found this book inviting and endearing. was very interesting to read. As someone who hopes to one day adopt I found the book very insightful. Jennifer Grant take you on her family's journey of adoption, in a very real and candid way, but she made me look at things through an entirely different lens, this book would be great for people considering adoption, people curious about the adoption process, family member who have other family members adopting, I would recommend it to anyone; whether they are looking into the process or not. Grant also includes numerous resources on adoption at the back of the book. I found myself unwilling to put it down, and read it in just a couple of days.

            Love you more is one of the most honest and inspiring books I have read lately. It is the author's story of adopting a daughter from Guatemala, into the her family of 3 biological children.


I have always been intriqued by adoption, and after reading this book I feel like a have a truer glimpse into the emotional journey adoption puts parents through. I treasured this book as I read it. Loving the beauty of her diverse family and proud of the author for her challenge to "broaden the image of what family looks like". The tenderness she felt in her heart for a Ã¢â¬Ëfourth child that seemed to be missing', was a beautiful picture. Her honesty about her imperfections as a mom and the also the challenges & emotions through the adoption process made her seem like a good friend as I read. I particularly liked reading about the blending of family and the learning all the children experinced while they welcomed a new sister.


I have recommended this book to friends who have considered adoption, and this book continues to put questions in my own mind about the role chrisitians can play in touching lives through opeing our homes.


I received this book free from the publisher through the BookSneezeÃÂ®.com book review bloggers program. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

            This book will captivate you every second! I could not put the book down until the next sequel... This one will gonna captive your heart, the author portrays a genuine story of acceptiveness. I would definitely recommend this book. Grant gently guides the reader to remember God's grace in their parenting and challenges parents to keep God as the primary and I had hoped there would be a big meeting of the two families, or perhaps a happy ending involving Jennifer, but I was still left with a sense of hope that things were changing.


This book was all about telling a story good enough to sell and you have to have bad guys. I would have blown part of that story out of the water for both. This book offers that gift page by page, along with valuable insights about how to love those closest to you. I felt compelled to close my eyes for a moment and take a deep breath before reading on. She is so open and unafraid to let you into her home that you feel like a close friend who has dropped by for a visit. I am just a few chapters form the end and I cannot make myself finish it. I love that she tells what makes her cry in frustration, what makes her laugh and the honest stories. She is a great writer who lets you know it's not just open your house and it makes a family.

            I always love books about adoption stories. Every story is unique but has common ties to other adoption stories. This is Grant's story of her family's adoption of a little girl from Guatemala named Mia. It details the journey that God took her family on as they researched and waited and shared with others along the way. Since our family has also adopted internationally, I could identify with all the emotions and the process - it brought back those emotions and memories for me. Her writing flowed easily to share her story, capturing the details and feelings, so that others could experience it with her.


I also appreciated how she shared how God opened her eyes to caring for orphans beyond just her adoption. The same has been true for our family. I love to see how God tells His story through our stories.


This book also includes tips for prospective adoptive parents, resources, and discussion questions at the end. I would enjoy reading this book with a book club some time. I have already shared it with our adoption support group.

                This review was written for Love You More: The Divine Surprise of Adopting My Daughter.
            
 
            Following the invisible thread of connection between people who are seemingly intended to become family, journalist Jennifer Grant shares the deeply personal, often humorous story of adopting a fifteen-month-old girl from Guatemala when she was already the mother of three very young children.


Her family's journey is captured in stories that will encourage not only adoptive families but those who are curious about adoption or whose lives have been indirectly touched by it. Love You More explores universal themes such as parenthood, marriage, miscarriage, infertility, connection, destiny, true self, failure and stumbling, and redemption.

I decided to review this book from Thomas Nelson because I was interested in adoption, and I love reading other people's trials, stories, and how God works in them.


This book was heartwarming and interesting, though I had a hard time getting into it at first. It's a great way to learn about the trials and joys of adoption (and how God sometimes wants you to step out of your comfort zone).


I'd give this book 4 out of 5 "hearts".

Product DescriptionFrom writer and veteran columnist Jennifer Grant comes an unflinching and spirited look at the transitions of midlife. When Did Everybody Else Get So Old? plumbs the physical, spiritual, and emotional changes unique to the middle years: from the emptying nest to the sagging effects of aging. Grant acknowledges the complexities and loss inherent in midlife and tells stories of sustaining disappointment, taking hard blows to the ego, undergoing a crisis of faith, and grieving the deaths not only of illusions but of loved ones. Yet she illuminates the confidence and grace that this season of life can also bring. Magnetic, good-humored, and full of hope in the sustaining power of the Spirit, this is a must-read for anyone facing the flux and flow of middle age.More Product InformationPublisher: Herald Press (VA)
