 Fourthstone Opportunity Fund LP
 Fourthstone LLC


Company Overview 


Fourthstone LLC was spun out of a NY family office.


Fund Strategy 


Fourthstone is a long/short fund focusing on banks, thrifts and other select investments.  The firm's Managing Partner was formerly CIO of a family office where he ran this strategy internally from 2010-2013.  The fund was launched in January 2014 with support from the family office and delivered 44% net returns in 2016, 24% net returns in 2015, and 19.5% net in 2014.  The fund employs a combination of buy-and-hold and short-term trading strategies to deliver absolute returns in both up and down markets.  Shorts are typically individual names and the strategy does not rely upon M&A activity or interest rate rises to generate returns.  Portfolio construction is based on both “bottom-up” research on individual companies and macro-level research on the U.S. and global economy.  Holdings are currently Level 1 equities of various market caps.  The fund seeks to be tax efficient where feasible.
