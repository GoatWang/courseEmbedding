The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

What makes Zumper a unique place to work at?



August 2015





First, the cross-pollination between our teams. We still don't have a single full-time product person at the company because our teams work so well together. On a daily basis you'll see an engineer talking to the support team, or one of our growth team leading up a project with our designer, all pulling in the same direction. It works really well.

Second, the camaraderie. We've built a culture where people love working and hanging out with each other. And that's a very special thing that we didn't always have, and that most startups never enjoy amidst the mania of growth.

On a daily basis you'll see an engineer talking to the support team, or one of our growth team leading up a project with our designer, all pulling in the same direction. It works really well.
