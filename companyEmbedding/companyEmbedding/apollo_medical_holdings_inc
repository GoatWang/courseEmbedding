Integrated Healthcare for Better Outcomes 
		

At ApolloMed, we focus on each patient’s healthcare
needs through our integrated network of high-quality
healthcare services.

Integrated Care SolutionsIntegrated Care Solutions is our strategy to partner with local providers to improve care Inpatient SolutionsInpatient Solutions is our care coordination and transitional care management system Physician Alignment SolutionsPhysician Alignment Solution is our range of full-risk solutions for Health Plans and Hospitals ApolloMed is a leading physician-driven, patient centric, integrated healthcare company providing inpatient and outpatient care for physicians and large patient populations.NEW! ApolloCareConnectApollo Care Connect is a clinically driven population health management solution for value-based care. Click below for more information:

Why ApolloMed?The high cost of healthcare is prompting a search for affordable, quality-care solutions that satisfy patient needs and expectations. Healthcare costs continue to rise, driven in part by increasing numbers of older Americans who account for high levels of healthcare expenditures, and by more Americans gaining healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
Fee-for-service healthcare plans lead to inefficiencies based on the absence of a comprehensive, integrated approach. Health plans are moving away from the fee-for-service framework to a more integrated accountable care model.
ApolloMed has built a platform of integrated healthcare services that promote efficiencies in fee-for-service, managed care and integrated healthcare environments.
Rapid growth and changing dynamics will drive the healthcare market.
We work collaboratively with patient care as our top priority.











 






Providing superior medical management for the efficient delivery of high-quality healthcare.

Our Integrated Care Solutions work to identify and manage patients who are at-risk for chronic conditions. Since 2001, we have proven that we are able to coordinate care across multiple facilities to reduce the overall cost of managing these patients at home and in alternative settings. ApolloMed also offers inpatient solutions through the management and delivery of hospital medicine and care.

Overview
Apollo Medical Holdings (ApolloMed) is a leading integrated healthcare company providing solutions to hospitals, health plans, physicians, and other health providers to provide cost-effective, quality healthcare. We work with providers and hospitals to coordinate care with local primary care physicians to reduce preventable hospital admissions and re-admissions, best in class patient centric care, and avoidable emergency room visits.
Our Integrated Care Solutions work to identify and manage patients who are at-risk for chronic conditions. Since 2001, we have proven that we are able to coordinate care across multiple facilities to reduce the overall cost of managing these patients at home and in alternative settings. ApolloMed also offers inpatient solutions through the management and delivery of hospital medicine and care.
Currently, our customers and integrated care network consists of more than 1,000 physicians and more than 50 hospitals and skilled nursing facilities. We also manage and operate four primary care clinics that are on the front-line of preventive and transitional care.

GLENDALE, Calif., Jan. 12, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc. ("ApolloMed" or "the Company") (AMEH), an integrated population health management company, is pleased to announce that Apollo Care Connect, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ApolloMed, has acquired the population health management technology and operating platform of Healarium, Inc.  The acquisition expands ApolloMed's medical management and care coordination capabilities and positions the company for further market expansion. 
Healarium, founded in 2009, provides a cloud and mobile-based population health management platform, with an emphasis on chronic care management and total patient engagement.  Among its distinctive components are a Care Management Dashboard which allows care managers to quickly focus on high-risk patients, Digital Care Plans which use evidence-based protocols, and a Personal Health Assistant, accessible via mobile or web, that allows patients to view their health data, care plans, receive alerts and to track goal progress.  With one click, physicians and care managers can prescribe patients a clinically appropriate and comprehensive treatment plan. This care plan is personalized and includes daily regimens which leverage ApolloMed's expertise in clinical care, care coordination and medical risk management.  Healarium's platform has reduced expenditures in patients with chronic conditions and also reduced hospital readmissions and emergency room visits.  Additionally, the platform supports the requirements to satisfy the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS") Chronic Care Management ("CCM") reimbursements for those Medicare enrollees with two or more chronic conditions.  Healarium has the capability to aggregate data from multiple sources, including hospital and physician electronic health records.  Healarium will continue to support Apollo Care Connect's growth.
"We believe that engaging patients in their own care is an important part of the changing landscape of healthcare," stated Warren Hosseinion, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc.  "Healarium's technology platform will further enable us to meet the new challenges in the evolving world of value-based reimbursements."
"Combining ApolloMed's clinical expertise and performance-based financial models with a robust chronic care management software platform is a powerful solution to today's healthcare needs," stated Gary Augusta, Executive Chairman of Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc.  "We look forward to working with our existing and future hospital, health plan and medical group partners who are looking to transition to a value-based care model."
About Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc. (ApolloMed)
Headquartered in Glendale, California, ApolloMed is a leading integrated population health management company committed to providing exceptional multi-disciplinary care in the communities it serves.  ApolloMed is addressing the healthcare needs of its patients by leveraging its integrated healthcare delivery platform comprised of six affiliated and complementary physician groups:  ApolloMed Hospitalists, ApolloMed ACO (Accountable Care Organization), Maverick Medical Group, AKM Medical Group, ApolloMed Care Clinics and Apollo Palliative Services. ApolloMed strives to improve medical outcomes with high-quality, cost-efficient care.  For more information, please visit www.apollomed.net

Why ApolloMed?The high cost of healthcare is prompting a search for affordable, quality-care solutions that satisfy patient needs and expectations. Healthcare costs continue to rise, driven in part by increasing numbers of older Americans who account for high levels of healthcare expenditures, and by more Americans gaining healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act.
Fee-for-service healthcare plans lead to inefficiencies based on the absence of a comprehensive, integrated approach. Health plans are moving away from the fee-for-service framework to a more integrated accountable care model.
ApolloMed has built a platform of integrated healthcare services that promote efficiencies in fee-for-service, managed care and integrated healthcare environments.
Rapid growth and changing dynamics will drive the healthcare market.
We work collaboratively with patient care as our top priority.
