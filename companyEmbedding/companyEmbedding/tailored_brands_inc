Tailored Brands - Misunderstood And Grossly Undervalued - Tailored Brands, Inc (NYSE:TLRD) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGOÂ»Tailored Brands - Misunderstood And Grossly UndervaluedJul. 4.17 | About: Tailored Brands, (TLRD) Casita Capital Deep Value, long/short equitySummaryCompany has the biggest market share in tuxedo rentals, a sector that has proven difficult for online only competitors and has an inelastic customer demand profile.Management is focused on reducing leverage.Company is free from headline distractions such as American Airlines/Twin Hill and the failed Macy's partnership.The Good Stuff Here is where I think Tailored Brands (NYSE: TLRD) stock can go in the next 6-12 months. Base Case (60% probability) = $20/share Bear Case (10% probability) = $8/share Bull Case (30% probability) = $30/share Company Overview Tailored Brands is a mens specialty apparel retailer offering formal clothing, business casual, sportswear, outerwear, shoes and accessories and tuxedo rentals. The company currently operates through 5 primary segments  Men's Wearhouse targets male customers aged 25-55 and offers a selection of exclusive and non-exclusive merchandise. Jos. A. Banks targets male customers aged 35-59 and offers tailored and business casual clothing and accessories, substantially all under the Jos. A. Bank label. Moores is a Canadian retail store chain offering a similar product as Men's Wearhouse stores as well as tuxedo rentals. K&G offers value-oriented superstore approach to appeal to price sensitive male and female customers in the apparel market. Corporate Apparel (Twin Hill and Dimensions UK) provides corporate clothing uniforms for workforces (e.g. British Airways, UPS (NYSE:UPS), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD)).  The company makes money through these brands by renting tuxedos, selling apparel and accessories, and providing corporate apparel. The bulk of my piece is focused on tuxedos because that is where I see the core value. Why is this business valuable? The underlying value for Tailored Brands lies in its rental offering. The company maintains a substantial share of the market, with close to 1/3rd of the $1.2bn industry in the US. This business is largely wedding and prom related, making the demand for such services more inelastic/recession proof. In the midst of a recession, high school students still go to proms and a groom's wedding party will require formalwear (a relatively minor expense compared to other aspects of the wedding.
 From a financial standpoint, the company is able to make compelling returns on its investments in tuxedo product from multiple rentals. For example, the company has recently been investing <$50mm in new working capital for cash gross margins of ~$400mm from tuxedo rentals. This does not include rent for the stores out of which they operate, but highlights the direct return on investment for the specific product. 

 Why is tuxedo rental important to valuation?  It's recession proof (or at least more so than most retail offerings). Department stores are risky because they sell apparel that a consumer can easily cut spending on when times get tough. They also get a material % of revenue from credit card income, which is linked to store credit cards and are susceptible to higher consumer default rates in a downturn. The opposite is true for tuxedo rentals given the more inelastic demand profile of prom and wedding party attendees. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Every business in retail needs to prove how it can compete vs. Amazon long term. Men's Wearhouse is able to compete today because of its national footprint that allows wedding parties to go into any store and get measured by a tailor for tuxedos in the same style for an event. Current online competitors have not been able to get critical capacity because they lack the footprint of Men's Wearhouse/Jos. A. Bank in the US. I estimate the combined revenue of online competitors (e.g. Black Tux, Menguin, and Generation Tux) to be <$25mm, a far cry from TLRD's $400mm business. In fact, Black Tux just announced a recent partnership with Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN) to have a shop-in-shop experience. This is interesting because it highlights the need for an in-store experience and because TLRD recently had trouble making a partnership with Macy's (NYSE:M) profitable. TLRD was attracted to Macy's bridal registry business as a way to drive traffic, but it did not pan out as anticipated. It will be exciting to see how Black Tux fares in Nordstrom, but the most recent example shows that the concept doesn't work well in a department store. 
 Why is the stock near all-time lows? Idiosyncratic and macro headlines have plagued the stock over the past 6 months.  The apparel sector showed weakness starting in December as holiday sales were weaker than anticipated across the board. That weakness persisted into 2017 as tax refund delays materially impacted January and February sales for most retailers. Additionally, the fear of Amazon has only grown and the launch of Prime Wardrobe and corresponding selloff across apparel retailers is just another sign of investor anxiety. However, I believe that the tuxedo rental business and tailored suiting will protect TLRD vs. Amazon for the foreseeable future. The Macy's partnership was a huge drag on fiscal 2017 guidance when TLRD reported Q4'2016 results in March. At the time, the company estimated a $20mm negative to operating income as a result of the partnership, or roughly $0.25 EPS (taking EPS to the range of $1.45-$1.75 vs. $1.70-$2.00). In May, they announced they were able to exit the partnership and would realize one-time charges to do so. The revised guidance still includes a $7-8mm loss from the partnership's operating loss YTD. If that loss is excluded, (given its non-recurring nature), the EPS range is comparable to the $1.75-$2.00/share range that I back into in Q4 excluding similar charges. As a note, it was rare this earnings season to find a retailer that beat Q1 EPS consensus estimates and at least maintained full year guidance, both of which TLRD achieved. American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL)/Twin Hill. There has been a large amount of press on the health issues AA flight staff have raised over the corporate apparel rollout that Twin Hill provided. At the end of the day, Twin Hill maintained proper standards and further tests did not reveal any illegal actions or poor standards. From AA's perspective, that doesn't resolve an unhappy workforce and they caved to their demands to explore other providers of uniforms in the future as these complaints did not seem to die down. The financial impact to TLRD is minimal. The EBITDA from AA given its replenishment nature (TLRD already sold them the product and are just maintaining it now) is minimal, around <2% of total company EBITDA by my estimates. In fact, the entire corporate apparel segment was only $13.7mm EBITDA of the $421mm EBITDA in fiscal 2015, or 3.2%. The company did not shift fiscal guidance when the non-renewal of the contract was announced, likely showing the impact is negligible. TLRD was also able to win a contract as 1 of 3 suppliers for McDonald's USA uniforms in the midst of the negative AA publicity. That highlights TLRD's ability to compete and the sustainability of its reputation. My view is that TLRD views corporate apparel as non-core and may be looking to sell that business to a larger player and use the funds to delever the balance sheet. Lastly, the company's CFO and general counsel both bought shares in the open market the day before the Twin Hill/American Air contract non-renewal was announced, again highlighting its negligible impact (why would they buy before instead of after if it's materially negative?). Eminence exit. Eminence capital is a hedge that had a 14.9% stake in TLRD. The firm's CIO was nominated by TLRD's BoD this year to join them. Instead, he withdrew his candidacy and his firm sold their stake close to $13/share after paying nearly $20/share for the last 1mm shares a few months prior. The market may have taken that as a negative signal that a large hedge fund that's backing the company and its story was effectively pulling its support by selling its position. I disagree as it was Eminence's push that (click on link and start at 22mins) was a primary reason why Men's Wearhouse eventually overpaid for Jos. A. Banks. 
 I don't believe these distractions suggest a deterioration in the core tuxedo rental or tailored offering of TLRD. One could argue that top brass, especially the CEO given his tenure, may be at fault for letting these distractions happen in the first place. I believe not even current management could ruin the value of the business. Balance Sheet TLRD is over-levered today for a retailer. However, the company's excess cash flow has been earmarked for debt reduction and management has proven they are committed to reducing debt. In the past 12 months, TLRD has repurchased $50mm bonds in the open market at a discount to par, reducing the note outstanding to $550mm from $600mm. They have also made excess cash flow sweep payments (as mandated by the credit agreement) on the floating rate term loan. Currently, they maintain a dividend of around $35mm per year. They could allocate that cash to debt repayment, but management likely does not want to send an erroneous message that they are worried about liquidity. Given the most recent forecast for improved cash flow YoY in 2017, the company should be able to generate $100mm of cash, after the dividend and mandatory term loan amortization payments. That is ample cash for near-term debt reduction, further reducing leverage and interest expense. An interesting item to keep track of is how resistant bond prices have been compared to the stock. It's unusual to see a dramatic divergence in bond/equity prices in a leveraged retailer with no hard assets (e.g. real estate), but I think it demonstrates that bond investors have a better understanding of the value and cash flow nature of the business than equity investors at the moment. 

 Other items to keep track of are (1) maturities aren't a risk as the nearest term facility is the term loan in 2021, (2) the ABL facility remains undrawn and (3) the company has sizable credit facility baskets that would allow it to tap the secured debt markets if the business got worse and it needed the cash. That last point is important when considering the downside, as it allows the company to maintain a lifeline in a bearish scenario.
 

 Valuation In the current market environment, retailers' P/E and EBITDA multiples have come under pressure. Investors' group think has left them to believe that most of the businesses won't survive an Amazon world (or more likely, in my view, the next economic downturn). That means that despite the fact a retailer has an attractive valuation, either on a historical basis or relative to other competitors, investors have shied away. Given my view that TLRD's core business is defensible, I think it has the merits of a value investment and not a value trap. The company will be able to generate $150mm of cash flow to equity this year (~25% free cash flow to equity), assuming mid $300mm of EBITDA, $100mm capex, $85mm cash interest, and $7mm of mandatory term loan paydowns. It trades at 6.5x the low end of my EPS for 2017 ($1.70/share), comparable to GNC which is a business in a much worse place as far as fundamentals and balance sheet. TLRD also continues to pay an above market dividend (6%+). In my view, a QoQ uptick in comps into Q2 in addition to investor awareness of the true value of TLRD will lead to a massive appreciation in the stock over the next 6-12 months. My base case price is $20/share based on an 11x P/E ratio of my 2018 EPS forecast, as investors realize how defensible the business model is. My bullish case sees shares trading closer to $30/share. Lastly, and important to any investor in a retail stock, I see downside at $7-8/share given the value in tux and liquidity/balance sheet strength. The next important catalyst is Q2 earnings in September followed by a likely management roadshow with institutional investors on the east coast, the first one in some time. 


 Many retailers have free cash flow yields in the 10+% context, likely a result of investor fear of declining cash flows in the near-to-medium term due to a variety of reasons (Amazon, economic concerns, high fixed expense due to leased stores). If we were to value TLRD in that range, here is a sensitivity for share price to different free cash flow and free cash flow yields. Keep in mind my estimate of $150mm free cash flow in 2017. 

 Other Items Short interest is upwards of 30%, due in part because of its classification as an apparel retailer and market group think to short all brick and mortar retailers. As the business moves past the American Air and Macy's distractions, comps begin to stabilize, cash flow improves, and management meets investors, I think a short squeeze could significantly amplify a rally in this name as it did in Q2 and Q3 in 2016. Finally, the sell side research on this stock is limited at best. Only three firms' equity research departments publish on TLRD (DB, Wunderlich, and Johnson Rice). I would argue that one reason this long opportunity exists is that so few eyeballs are paying attention to it.

Our Story
In 1854, Alexandra was established in Bristol as a linen drapery and rapidly grew into a thriving department store. Throughout the twentieth century, the business developed a market-leading range of stock-backed workwear and uniforms, heavily marketed through catalogs and retail shops, and eventually became a PLC. By the end of the 1990s, Alexandra had become the largest single provider of workwear, corporate uniforms and nursing wear in the UK. In 2010, Alexandra was acquired by The Menâs Wearhouse, Inc.
Alexandra invests in developing digital solutions to improve the customer experience at every touchpoint.Â Our core strategies of accelerating product lifecycles and continually updating classic styles remain our focus today. By leveraging existing reach and distribution to service core sectors, Alexandra continues to build a substantial position in the UK, while also expanding further into targeted International markets.

Men's Wearhouse parent Tailored Brands shares lower after Q1 revenue miss
Tailored Brands Inc.  shares turned lower late Wednesday after the company, the parent of men's apparel retailer Jos. A. Banks, Men's Wearhouse, and others, reported fiscal first-quarter per-share earnings well above Wall Street expectations but missed revenue forecasts. Tailored Brands said it earned $1.8 million, or 4 cents a share, in the quarter, compared with $1.6 million, or 3 cents a share, for the same quarter last year. Adjusted for one-time items, the company earned $13.1 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with $13.9 million, or 29 cents a share, a year ago. Sales reached $782.9 million, down 5% from a year ago. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected the company to report adjusted earnings of 19 cents a share on sales of $793 million. The agreement with Macy's Inc.  to wind down a tuxedo rental partnership "eliminates the risk of extended future operating losses and enables us to focus on our rental business at Men's Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and Moores," the company said in a statement. The company reaffirmed the EPS outlook for fiscal 2017 it had provided last month, forecasting earnings between $1.37 and $1.67 a share for the year. As previously announced, all 170 tuxedo shops at Macy's will be closed in the second quarter, the company said. The shares ended the regular session up 5.8%.

Tailored Brands shares spike after full-year guidance revised
Tailored Brands Inc.  shares jumped nearly 8% in late-Wednesday trading after the company updated its fiscal 2017 guidance. The revision was due to earlier news that it had ended its tuxedo rental partnership with Macy's Inc. . Tailored Brands now expects to report one-time charges of about $17.0 million. The company forecasts earnings per share in the range of $1.37 to $1.67, down from previous guidance of $1.45 to $1.75. Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.90. The FactSet consensus is for EPS of $1.72. Tailored Brands shares are down 50.7% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index  is up 6.7% for the period.

Macy's and Men's Wearhouse parent Tailored Brands to end tuxedo rental partnership
Macy's Inc.  and Tailored Brands Inc.  announced Wednesday that they are winding down their tuxedo rental license agreement, established with Men's Wearhouse on June 9, 2015. The Tuxedo Shops will take new reservations until June 1, 2017, with operations ending by July 14, 2017. All customers with rentals after this period will be offered the option to transfer the reservation to a nearby Men's Wearhouse or Jos. A Bank. In March, Tailored Brands reported a $14 million charge after expecting startup losses of $10 million. The increase was due to missing the bulk of wedding season, said Tailored Brands Chief Executive Douglas Ewert on the earnings call. Macy's shares are down 0.2% in late-Wednesday trading, and down 26.2% for the past year. Tailored Brands is up 7.1% in after hours trading, but down 26.4% for the last year. The S&P 500 index  is up 15.7% for the last 12 months.

Men's Wearhouse in Miamisburg, Ohio


Tailored Brands, Inc. is a U.S.-based, retail holding company for various men's apparel stores, including the Men's Wearhouse and Joseph A. Bank brands. [2]
The company is headquartered in Fremont, California, with additional corporate offices in the Westchase area of Houston, Texas. [3] It is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol, TLRD.
History and operations[edit]
Tailored Brands, Inc. was established in January 2016, by Men's Wearhouse, as a holding company for the Men's Wearhouse brand and other brands owned by it. [2]




Men's Wearhouse in Saugus, Massachusetts


Founded in 1973, by George Zimmer, as a retail men's clothing store, Zimmer turned Men's Wearhouse into an industry consolidator, acquiring numerous competitors throughout his tenure leading the firm. Today, as Tailored Brands, the company operates Men's Wearhouse, Men's Wearhouse & Tux, K&G Superstores (an off-price retail chain), Moores Clothing for Men (a Canadian chain of men's clothing stores), Twin Hill Corporate clothing, MW Cleaners in the Houston and Austin areas, and Jos A. Bank. In 1997, it purchased, then liquidated, the bankrupt Kuppenheimer chain.[4]
Men's Wearhouse notably ran television and radio commercials featuring Zimmer, and the oft-repeated slogan, "You're going to like the way you look; I guarantee it."[5] According to Business Week, Men's Wearhouse targets the common man, with "the neatly displayed clothes in Zimmer's stores [being] designed to cater to the unpretentious guy who wants to do as little as possible to maintain his wardrobe."[6]
On November 17, 2006, Men's Wearhouse acquired After Hours Formalwear, a clothier specializing in black tie formalwear, from Federated Department Stores, the parent company of department store company Macy's. After Hours Formalwear was originally rebranded MW Tux, but has now been rolled up under the Men's Wearhouse brand. The formalwear group within Men's Wearhouse specializes in tuxedo rentals for men and boys for black tie events.
In 2009, Men's Wearhouse became a major sponsor of the United Football League and continued to sponsor the league in 2010. In that same year, the company acquired the trade and assets of Alexandra plc, which was in administration and Dimensions Corporatewear to develop its presence in Europe.
In 2013, the company acquired the Joseph Abboud brand to its lineup. [7]




"You're gonna like the way you look. I guarantee it."


On June 19, 2013, the company dismissed founder and Executive Chairman George Zimmer for undisclosed reasons.[8] The company later stated that Zimmer was dismissed due to "difficulty accepting the fact that Men's Wearhouse is a public company with an independent board of directors and that he has not been the chief executive officer for two years. He advocated for significant changes that would enable him to regain control."[9]
Acquisition of Jos. A. Bank[edit]
In October 2013, Menâs Wearhouse received a $2.4Â billion acquisition offer from smaller rival Jos. A. Bank.[10] Menâs Wearhouse countered with an offer of its own, which sparked a five-month takeover battle between the two menswear retailers. After Jos. A. Bank rejected the initial counteroffer, Menâs Wearhouse announced that it would increase its all-cash bid if Jos. A. Bank revealed limited financial information and entered into negotiations.[11] In an attempt to dilute shares and become too large for Menâs Wearhouse to purchase, Jos. A. Bank agreed to acquire the menâs outdoor clothing company Eddie Bauer for $825 million.[12] Menâs Wearhouse immediately responded by filing a lawsuit to block the proposed acquisition, which was expedited by Delaware Judge J. Travis Laster.â[13] The lawsuit required Jos. A. Bank to disclose documents relating to the deal and prevented it from closing the deal without giving Menâs Wearhouse 10 days' notice.
On November 12, 2013, Ricky Sandler, CEO of Eminence Capital LLC, published a letter he sent to Men's Wearhouse CEO Douglas Ewert discussing a merger with Joseph. A. Bank Clothiers Inc.[14] On November 15, 2013, Joseph A. Bank Clothiers Inc. withdrew "its all-cash proposal to purchase Men's Wearhouse for $48 a share after its self-imposed November 14 deadline".[15]
In March 2014, Menâs Wearhouse reached an agreement to acquire Jos. A. Bank for $1.8Â billion, on the condition that it dropped its acquisition bid for Eddie Bauer.[16] A Federal Trade Commission investigation into the deal concluded in April 2014, concluding that the merger was "not likely to harm consumers"; the completion of this investigation was required for the merger to go forward.[17]

Reports Fiscal 2016 Fourth Quarter And Full Year ResultsPR NewswireMarch 8, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareFREMONT, Calif., March 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Tailored Brands, Inc. (TLRD) today announced consolidated financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year ended January 28, 2017 and provided its outlook for fiscal 2017.Fourth quarter 2016 GAAP diluted loss per share was $0.62, compared to a loss of $21.86 in the same period a year ago.Â  Fourth quarter 2016 GAAP operating loss includes a $14 million non-cash impairment charge related to fixed assets in our Macy's tuxedo stores. Last year's fourth quarter results included approximately $1.18 billion of goodwill, intangible asset and other impairment charges primarily related to Jos. A. Bank.Â  Excluding certain items(1), fourth quarter 2016 adjusted diluted loss per share(1) was $0.19, compared to adjusted diluted loss per share of $0.30 in the fourth quarter of 2015.Â Full year 2016 GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.51,Â compared to GAAP loss per share of $21.26 last year. Fiscal 2016 adjusted diluted EPS(1) was $1.76, compared to adjusted diluted EPS of $1.80 last year.MANAGEMENT COMMENTARYDoug Ewert, president and chief executive officer of Tailored Brands, stated, "Fiscal 2016 was a year of significant strategic progress for Tailored Brands as we executed on our plans to right-size our store base, optimize our cost structure, and return Jos. A. Bank to a path of sustained profitable growth.Â  I am pleased with our delivery on our operational initiatives that we established for 2016. Â We closed 233 stores under our store rationalization program, we achieved over $60 million in cost savings through our profit improvement plan, and we stabilized and began to turn around Jos. A. Bank. Â With a focus on continued operational excellence, we have built a strong foundation for future growth."Unfortunately, the challenging retail environment resulted in soft traffic across our retail brands, which drove lower than anticipated fourth quarter and full year net sales and gross margins.Â  Despite this, we delivered near the mid-point of our full year adjusted EPS guidance through disciplined expense management and a lower effective tax rate. We also generated $243 million of cash flow from operations in 2016."While we are striving for improved performance in 2017, in anticipation of a continuation of current business trends, we project diluted EPS in the range of $1.45 to $1.75 for fiscal 2017.Â  Our outlook assumes Men's Wearhouse comparable sales down low-single digits, Jos. A. Bank comparable sales up mid-single digits, and Moores and K&G comparable sales down mid-single-digits in 2017.Â  Our outlook for 2017 also assumes a decline in our Corporate Apparel business as we lap the large airline uniform program we rolled out in 2016," said Ewert."Our 2017 plan includes reinvestment of some of the cost savings we achieved to support our omni-channel strategies.Â  The demand for convenience, a more personalized experience and casual wardrobe options has never been more pronounced.Â  In response, we are accelerating our efforts to translate our high-service, in-store experience online and to drive additional traffic to our stores.Â "In addition, our outlook includes an estimated operating loss of between $19 million and $20 million from the Macy's tuxedo business.Â  During 2016, our Macy's tuxedo business did not ramp as expected. Â We are actively engaged in discussions with Macy's to restructure our agreement.Â  Due to the early stages of our negotiations, our current 2017 plan assumes no further Macy's store expansion and that adjusted operating losses grow from $14 million in 2016 to between $19 million to $20 million in 2017 under the terms of the current agreement.Â  Given current and forecasted results, and the likelihood that a restructured agreement will involve a different operating model, we recorded an asset impairment charge of $14 million in the fourth quarter related to fixed assets in the Macy's stores," said Ewert."We remain focused on delivering long-term value to our shareholders with disciplined capital management and prudent investment in our organic growth strategies. In 2017, we plan to invest approximately $90 million in capital expenditures and to use free cash flow to pay down debt."Read More  (1)   See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information on items excluded from adjusted EPS.Â  These items primarily consist of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, costs related to our store rationalization and profit improvement initiatives, non-cash asset impairment charges and integration costs related to Jos. A. Bank.Â  Non-GAAP adjusted EPS is referred to as "adjusted EPS" for simplicity.  SALES REVIEWThe table that follows is a summary of total net sales for the fourth quarter and full year ended January 28, 2017.Â  The dollars shown are U.S. dollars in millions and, due to rounded numbers, may not sum.Â  Comparable sales exclude the net sales of a store for any month of one period if the store was not owned or open throughout the same month of the prior period and include e-commerce net sales.Â  The Moores comparable sales change is based on the Canadian dollar.Â  In addition, Jos. A. Bank comparable sales exclude factory stores. Â Fiscal 2015 comparable sales shown below for Jos. A. Bank are based on a comparison to Jos. A. Bank's fiscal 2014 sales, a portion of which was prior to the acquisition on June 18, 2014.Â Â   Fourth Quarter Net Sales Summary â Fiscal 2016       Net Sales   Comparable Sales Change      Net Sales Change   CurrentQuarter   % of Total Sales   Current Quarter   Prior YearQuarter     Retail Segment   (3.9%)   ($29.6)   $738.3   93.1%   (1.2%)   (10.4%)     Â Â Â Â Â Â  Men's Wearhouse   (3.7%)   ($14.8)   $384.6   48.5%   (2.2%)   4.3%     Â Â Â Â Â Â  Jos.

A. Bank comparable sales for the fourth quarter increased 3.6% primarily due to increases in both average transactions per store and units per transaction, partially offset by a decrease in average unit retail.Â  Jos. A. Bank net sales for the fourth quarter decreased 4.7% due to significant store closures in 2016 as part of the Company's store rationalization program that more than offset comparable sales increases.K&G comparable sales for the fourth quarter decreased 5.2% primarily due to lower average transactions per store partially offset by an increase in units per transaction and average unit retail.Â Moores comparable sales for the fourth quarter decreased 5.4% primarily due to decreases in both average transactions per store and units per transaction partially offset by an increase in average unit retail.Â  However, total net sales for Moores decreased only 2.1% primarily due to favorable currency fluctuations.Net sales for the Corporate Apparel segment for the fourth quarter decreased 4.8% primarily due to unfavorable currency fluctuations partially offset by higher U.S. sales.FOURTH QUARTER GAAP RESULTSBelow is a comparison table and discussion of the consolidated fourth quarter FY 2016 to fourth quarter FY 2015 operating results.Â   Consolidated Fourth Quarter FY 2016 Comparison to Fourth Quarter FY 2015 Operating Results                 Q4 FY16   Q4 FY16   Q4 FY15   Q4 FY15   Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Variance        $   % of Sales   $   % of Sales   Dollar   %      Net sales:            Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Retail clothing product   $639,262   80.6%   $ Â  Â 668,008   80.9%   $(28,746)   -4.3%      Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Rental services   53,880   6.8%   50,669   6.1%   3,211   6.3%      Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Alteration and other servicesÂ Â Â    45,147   5.7%   49,226   6.0%   (4,079)   -8.3%      Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Total retail sales   738,289   93.1%   767,903   93.0%   (29,614)   -3.9%      Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Corporate apparel clothing product   54,974   6.9%   57,759   7.0%   (2,785)   -4.8%      Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Total net sales   793,263   100.0%   825,662   100.0%   (32,399)   -3.9%                Gross margin(1):            Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Retail clothing product   341,838   53.5%   358,467   53.7%   (16,629)   -4.6%      Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Rental services   37,059   68.8%   36,809   72.6%   250   0.7%      Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Alteration and other services   12,328   27.3%   12,902   26.2%   (574)   -4.4%      Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Occupancy costs   (103,625)   -14.0%   (113,506)   -14.8%   9,881   8.7%      Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Total retail gross margin   287,600   39.0%   294,672   38.4%   (7,072)   -2.4%      Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Corporate apparel clothing product   14,517   26.4%   16,527   28.6%   (2,010)   -12.2%      Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Total gross margin   302,117   38.1%   311,199   37.7%   (9,082)   -2.9%                Advertising expense   51,409   6.5%   61,357   7.4%   (9,948)   -16.2%      Selling, general and administrative expenses   254,499   32.1%   265,110   32.1%   (10,611)   -4.0%      Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges   -   -   1,153,254   139.7%   (1,153,254)   -100.0%      Asset impairment charges   15,065   1.9%   25,785   3.1%   (10,720)   -41.6%                Operating loss   $(18,856)   -2.4%   $(1,194,307)   -144.6%   $1,175,451   -98.4%                Summary of Operating Income (Loss) by Reportable Segment         Retail   $ 29,552   4.0%   $(1,152,936)   150.1%   $1,182,488   Â Â Â Â  NM      Corporate apparel   1,027   1.9%   1,338   2.3%   (311)   -23.2%      Shared services   (49,435)   -6.2%   (42,709)   -5.2%   (6,726)   15.7%                Total operating loss   $(18,856)   -2.4%   $(1,194,307)   -144.6%   $1,175,451   -98.4%                    Â (1) As a percent of related sales.

A. Bank.Â  Management uses these adjusted results to assess the Company's performance, to make decisions about how to allocate resources and to develop expectations for future operating performance.Â  In addition, adjusted EPS is used as a performance measure in the Company's executive compensation program to determine the number of performance units that are ultimately earned for certain equity awards.The non-GAAP financial information should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or as being superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.Â  Management strongly encourages investors and shareholders to review the Company's financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.Â Reconciliations of non-GAAP information to our actual results follow and amounts may not sum due to rounded numbers.Â  In addition, only the line items affected by adjustments are shown in the tables.Â   GAAP to Non-GAAP Adjusted Consolidated Statements of Earnings Information          GAAP to Non-GAAP Adjusted - Three Months Ended January 28, 2017      Consolidated Results   GAAP Results   Jos.
