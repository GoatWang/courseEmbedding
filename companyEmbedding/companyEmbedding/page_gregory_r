About the Author(s)
Robert Gregory earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Minnesota where he absorbed a healthy respect for the value of empiricism in psychological testing.  He taught at the University of Idaho for 23 years where he also developed a private practice in assessment.  In his practice, he specialized in the evaluation of intellectual disability and cognitive impairment.  His academic research centered on assessment topics such as subtle cognitive differences in left-handers, the impact of subclinical lead exposure on intelligence, the psychometric qualities of a wide variety of cognitive and personality tests, and meta-analysis.  In one phase of his assessment career, he estimates evaluating more than 100 applicants for law enforcement positions.  He has taught psychological assessment for 40 years.  On 50 separate occasions, he has offered a course featuring one or another of the Wechsler scales (“Now do this one as quickly as you can, and be sure to tell me when you are finished”).  He was professor of psychology at Wheaton College (Illinois) for seventeen years, including eight years as department chair, and five years as director of their doctoral program (Psy.D.) in clinical psychology.  In his spare time he is an ambivalent jogger (motto: “Start slow and taper off”).  He also does watercolors (motto: “Ability is over-rated”) which he stores in a secret compartment in his basement.  He practices mindfulness-based meditation on a regular basis (seriously).  He resides in the Seattle area and maintains an active interest in testing and clinical psychology.  He is Professor Emeritus at Wheaton College (IL).

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
