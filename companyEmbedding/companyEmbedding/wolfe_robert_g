A motor vehicle accident that leads to a neck injury can result in cervical vertigo. Along with dizziness, cervical vertigo symptoms may include neck pain, decreased neck range of motion, pain in the shoulders or into your shoulder blades and headache. By treating the cause of the neck pain and headaches, along with improving neck range of motion, patients experience a decrease in occurrences of dizziness.Joint ReplacementPodiatristsPlantar FasciitisDermatologistsLesionsLesions in the vestibular system may impact the messages sent to the brain regarding your body’s position in space resulting in decreased balance, reduction in the ability to focus on an object, and a lower tolerance to motion2. Physical therapy treatment will include exercises to improve balance, habituate head with body motions, and stabilization of visual focus on both moving and stationary objects.Physical TherapistsShoulder PainSports MedicineTroy attends continuing education regularly.

Combination stretches into multiple planes of motion target the sternocleidomstoid muscle in supine, prone, sitting and side lying positions. One on one techniques utilize bilateral upper extremity task completion including fine motor skills and scapular stabilization.GeriatricsNeck PainBack PainPhysical TherapyHave you ever stood up and experienced the sensation that the room is spinning around you? Most often this is a result of standing too quickly, standing too long, or low blood sugar. Usually the symptoms pass quickly, and there are no long term implications. Unfortunately many individuals endure these sensations on a daily basis as a result of a more complex diagnosis. The good news is many causes of dizziness are successfully treated by physical therapy.Send to PhoneWolfe, Robert G510 Towne Dr # 100, Fayetteville, NY 13066(315) 637-4747Send this business listing as a text message to a mobile phone.I agree to the Terms and ConditionsCancelSendYour text message was sent.To opt out at anytime, send the word STOP to YP411.To get a help message, send the word HELP to YP411.There was an error sending your text.Please try again.E-MailWolfe, Robert G510 Towne Dr # 100, Fayetteville, NY 13066(315) 637-4747Send this business details to yourself or up to 5 friends.Up to 5 email addresses, separate addresses with a commaSend Yourself a CopyCancelSend
