and Whitebox Hedged High Yield Advisors, LLC (“Whitebox Hedged”), by their

undersigned attorneys, for their claims against Defendant CompuCredit Holdings

Corporation (“CompuCredit” or “the Company”), states and alleges as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1.

Plaintiffs collectively own or have an interest in a majority of the 3.625%

convertible senior notes due 2025 issued by CompuCredit pursuant to an indenture dated

May 27, 2005 (“3.625% Notes) and 5.875% convertible senior notes due 2035 issued by

CompuCredit pursuant to an indenture dated November 23, 2005 (“5.875% Notes)

(collectively, the “Notes”). All beneficial holders of the Notes are referred to herein as

the “Noteholders.”

2.

CompuCredit, a subprime financial services provider, is a public company

owned primarily by David Hanna, the CEO, his brother Frank, and other corporate

insiders. In its latest quarterly filing on November 9, 2009, the Company once again

-2-

Case 0:09-cv-03664-JMR-FLN Document 1 Filed 12/21/09 Page 3 of 18

emphasized to the marketplace that it is in severe financial distress. The Company

reported plunging asset values on its balance sheet, alarming and increasing losses, a

disturbing lack of liquidity and, perhaps most disturbingly, the possibility that the

Company will not be in a position to meet its obligation to repay more than $230 million

of Notes in 2012.

3.

One thing that the Company’s filings clearly did not suggest was that

shareholders should anticipate distributions any time soon, particularly in light of the

Company’s significant debt obligations. CompuCredit has approximately $390 million in

Notes outstanding, of which $231.5 million are due to be repurchased by the Company in

May 2012 at par – a responsibility which, as mentioned above, the Company indicated

that it does not believe it can meet given its current circumstances.

4.

Less than a month after the above filing, however, the Company revealed a

startling response to the challenges it faced: a decision to funnel as much cash and assets

to management and other corporate insiders as possible, while leaving the holders of the

Company’s Notes holding the bag. In a December 3, 2009 press release (attached hereto

as Ex. A), the Company announced a massive cash dividend of almost $25 million – an

amount that constituted over twenty percent of the market capitalization of the Company

at the time (and nearly twenty-five percent of its last reported available cash). It was the

first dividend the Company had ever declared, which was astonishing in light of the

Company’s stated liquidity crisis, its staggering ongoing losses, and its 2012 repurchase

obligation. In the same press release the Company, once again ignoring its obligations to

-3-

Case 0:09-cv-03664-JMR-FLN Document 1 Filed 12/21/09 Page 4 of 18

its creditors, also indicated that corporate insiders should expect additional cash

dividends to be issued in the future.

5.

The Company didn’t stop there, however. In addition to announcing its

intention to issue a dividend that exceeded twenty percent of its current capitalization, the

Company also announced its intention to spin off the microloan segment of its business –

the only segment of the Company’s business that is currently generating a profit. Like

the dividend, this asset would go to CompuCredit shareholders and therefore primarily to

the CEO, his brother, and other corporate insiders.

6.

The Company has thus embarked on a deliberate strategy of stripping itself

of assets, distributing those assets to insiders, and disabling itself from meeting its

obligations to its creditors. There is a phrase for such a strategy: the phrase is “fraudulent

transfer,” which the law does not permit in the guise of a dividend or otherwise.

7.

Finally, on a pro-forma balance sheet basis, the liabilities already exceed

the Company’s assets and its insolvency is imminent absent an unexpected resurgence in

operations. As a result, the Plaintiffs have determined that it is necessary to bring this

action to protect the holders of the Notes by seeking an immediate halt to the Company’s

unlawful course of conduct before any of the proposed, unlawful transfers are

consummated.

CompuCredit Holdings Corporation. CompuCredit Corporation and CompuCredit

Holdings Corporation are collectively referred to herein as “CompuCredit.”

VENUE AND JURISDICTION

21.

This court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332(a)

because this action is between citizens of different states and of foreign states and the

amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

22.

This court has personal jurisdiction over Defendant because CompuCredit,

or a closely integrated subsidiary acting on its behalf, has substantial operations and

conducts substantial business in Minnesota. One of the six office locations listed on

CompuCredit’s website is in St. Cloud, Minnesota. As a result, CompuCredit has such

systematic and continuous contacts with Minnesota that it is subject to the general

jurisdiction of Minnesota’s courts.

23.

Furthermore, with respect to the Notes that underlie this suit, CompuCredit

has and continues to direct activities toward Minnesota through its relationship with the

indenture trustee, U.S. Bank. On information and belief, U.S. Bank services the Notes

through its offices in Minnesota, including receiving fees and any payments to

Noteholders.

24.

Venue is appropriate in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(a) a

substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in this district and this

action concerns Notes which are administered by an indenture trustee sitting in this

district.

-7-

Case 0:09-cv-03664-JMR-FLN Document 1 Filed 12/21/09 Page 8 of 18

FACTS

25.

CompuCredit is, according to its investor relations website, “a provider of

various credit and related financial services and products to or associated with the

underserved, or sub-prime, consumer credit market.” Within this sub-prime consumer

credit market, CompuCredit has four main business segments: (1) credit cards, (2) auto

lending, (3) retail micro-loans, and (4) Jefferson Capital Systems, LLC, a “subsidiary that

provides innovative and non-traditional debt recovery solutions.”

26.

CompuCredit, while its stock is publicly traded on NASDAQ under the

ticker symbol “CCRT”, is primarily owned by corporate insiders. The Company’s

Chairman and CEO, David Hanna, together with his brother, owns approximately 54% of

the Company’s equity, and the Chief Operating Officer and an outside director together

own nearly 9% of the Company’s stock (although they each disclaim beneficial

ownership of at least some portion of their holdings).

27.

Upon information and belief, neither CompuCredit Holdings nor its

predecessor corporation has ever paid a dividend to stockholders. In fact, CompuCredit’s

Investor Relations website continues to state that the Company has a policy of not paying

dividends. Specifically, CompuCredit’s website states:

Does CompuCredit pay dividends? Does CompuCredit have a dividend
reinvestment plan?

CompuCredit currently does not pay dividends. We are guided by a strategy
focusing on long-term success and believe the best opportunity for long-
term appreciation of our capital is continue to finance our operations and
growth[.]

-8-

Case 0:09-cv-03664-JMR-FLN Document 1 Filed 12/21/09 Page 9 of 18

“Investors FAQ,” available at
http://investor.compucredit.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=115652&p=irol-faq, last
accessed December 20, 2009.

COMPUCREDIT IS ADMITTEDLY HEMORRHAGING CASH AND
FACING A LIQUIDITY CRISIS.

28.

The widespread and well-known problems in the subprime financial

services sectors have hit CompuCredit especially hard, as the Company made clear when

it declared that it is facing a liquidity crisis in its most recent 10-Q quarterly filing with

the SEC, dated November 9, 2009 (the “November 10-Q”). Specifically, the Company

declared that “we have no meaningful access to liquidity,” and that “significant

uncertainties” exist as to when liquidity markets will improve.

29.

In the November 10-Q, the Company also declared that it had lost $239

million in the last quarter, and a total of $487 million in the last year to date. It stated that

as of September 30, 2009, the Company’s shareholders possessed only $238 million in

equity, a number which (if it is not overstated) only narrowly exceeds the amount it has

lost in the last quarter.

30. Moreover, on 

information and belief, 

reasonable adjustments 

to

CompuCredit’s reported equity, based upon disclosures regarding its off-balance sheet

risks and non-cash adjustments, renders its liabilities greater than its assets by

approximately $186 million. Thus, on a pro-forma balance sheet basis, the company is

insolvent or imminently so. The ability of CompuCredit to pay debts generally as they

become due is increasingly in doubt absent extreme, unexpected and immediate

improvement in its operations.

-9-

Case 0:09-cv-03664-JMR-FLN Document 1 Filed 12/21/09 Page 10 of 18

31.

Given these dramatic losses, the Company repeatedly emphasized the need

to preserve its remaining capital in the November 10-Q. For instance, the Company

reduced operating expenses resulting from “decreases in marketing and solicitation costs

due to our desire to preserve capital given the ongoing dislocation of the liquidity

markets and our corresponding scale back of our credit card marketing efforts… ” The

Company further stated that “[g]iven our current focus on cost-cutting and capital

preservation in light of the continuing dislocation in the liquidity markets and significant

uncertainties as to when those markets will improve, we expect further reductions in

marketing efforts and expense levels and in most other cost categories … in the next

several quarters.” (emphasis added). The Company further stated that it was managing

its business “with the assumption that the liquidity markets will not return to more

traditional levels in the near term.”

32.

CompuCredit’s near term financial outlook is particularly bleak in light of

imminent substantial financial obligations. In January 2010, the Company’s $750 million

credit facility (its largest) expires. CompuCredit has disclosed that “our failure to renew

or replace a maturing financing or securitization facility (except where the facility may

represent excess and unneeded capacity) could potentially result in (1) asset seizures by

our lenders or investors, which in turn would result in impairments to the book value of

our equity, and/or (2) accelerated repayment amortization schedules, including early

amortization, which over time could impair the profitability of the assets underlying the

facility.” In the face of the abysmal credit environment for CompuCredit’s business, the

Company’s heavy dependence on securitizations and other borrowings to finance its

-10-

Case 0:09-cv-03664-JMR-FLN Document 1 Filed 12/21/09 Page 11 of 18

operations greatly increases the risk of asset fire sales and other measures detrimental to

its financial viability.

33.

As CompuCredit is aware, the holders of the 3.675% Notes have a right to

put those Notes in May 2012. In the November 10-Q, CompuCredit indicated that it will

not be able to meet that obligation through operation of its business, given the current

financial state of the Company (even before announcing the Dividend), and must rely on

the speculative possibility that it can raise the money through securities offerings.

Specifically, CompuCredit stated that “given our current liquidity position and future

liquidity prospects … , we may need to rely on debt or equity issuances or possible

exchange offerings, none of which are assured, in order to meet our May 2012

obligation to satisfy, in cash payments, conversions of” the 3.675% Notes, “of which

$231.5 million in face amount is outstanding.” (emphasis added)

34.

In the November 10-Q, CompuCredit stated that it intended to pursue a

strategy to compromise the rights of the Noteholders. Specifically, the Company assured

shareholders that it would “evaluate and pursue additional opportunities to repurchase our

convertible senior notes … at discounts to face amounts.”

COMPUCREDIT ANNOUNCES PLAN TO STRIP THE COMPANY’S
CASH AND SPIN OFF ONLY PROFITABLE SEGMENT.

35.

Less than a month after declaring that the Company was “focus[ed] on cost-

cutting and capital preservation” and in spite of its stated policy not to pay dividends,

CompuCredit issued a press release on December 3, 2009 (the “Press Release”)

announcing that “its Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $.50 per share payable

-11-

Case 0:09-cv-03664-JMR-FLN Document 1 Filed 12/21/09 Page 12 of 18

to holders of record as of the close of trading on December 31, 2009,” to be paid “on or

after December 31, 2009, but not later than February 28, 2010.” The Press Release also

stated that the Company’s board “also is evaluating the declaration of additional cash

dividends in the future.”

36. With nearly 50 million shares currently outstanding, this announced

dividend will result in the stripping of almost $25 million of the Company’s rapidly

dwindling assets, with over half of that amount going to corporate insiders.

37.

The announced dividend flies in the face of the Company’s staggering

ongoing losses, its acknowledgement of the dire credit environment in which it is

operating, and its stated goal of preserving capital to shore up its operations.

38.

The announced dividend is transparently intended to force the Noteholders

to convert the Notes at a significant discount by telling them that the Company has no

interest in fulfilling its obligations under the Notes just as the Company suggested that it

would do in the November 10-Q. The Press Release is not bashful about the Company’s

intentions to shortchange Noteholders stating that “[t]he payment of this cash dividend

will entitle holders of the Company's convertible notes to convert their notes and receive,

using an assumed December 2, 2009 closing trading price of the Company’s stock, either

approximately $74.79 or approximately $61.46 for each $1,000 face amount of notes,

depending upon which series is held.”

39.

Just in case Noteholders did not get the message that CompuCredit did not

intend to fulfill its obligations under the Notes, the Company also announced in the Press

Release that “it is considering a tax-free spin-off of its U.S. and U.K. micro-loan

-12-

Case 0:09-cv-03664-JMR-FLN Document 1 Filed 12/21/09 Page 13 of 18

businesses into a publicly-traded company called Purpose Financial Holdings, Inc.”

According to the Press Release, “[t]he businesses to be evaluated for spin-off had

revenues of approximately $98.4 million and $107.2 million for the nine months ended

September 30, 2009 and year ended December 31, 2008, respectively.”

40.

In other words, the Press Release told Noteholders that while the Company

as a whole was losing money to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars per quarter,

the Company was proposing to spin off the only portion of the business that had been

generating revenue (over $100 million in annual revenues) and take another $25 million

out of the corporate coffers primarily for the benefit of insiders. The message to

Noteholders is clear: convert your Notes, because the Company’s management has no

interest in leaving the Company with enough assets to pay you what you are due. These

actions are not only an unfair inversion of the traditional preference for debt holders over

equity holders, they are barred by the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act and the Georgia

Corporate Code.

COUNT I

Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act

41.

Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-40 as though set forth fully

herein.

42.

The Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act provides in section 4 that a transfer

made by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor if the debtor made the transfer “without

receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfer or obligation” –

surely the case here – and the debtor either: “was engaged or was about to engage in a

-13-

Case 0:09-cv-03664-JMR-FLN Document 1 Filed 12/21/09 Page 14 of 18

business or a transaction for which the remaining assets of the debtor were unreasonably

small in relation to the business or transaction”; or “[i]ntended to incur, or believed or

reasonably should have believed that he or she would incur, debts beyond his or her

ability to pay as they became due.”

43.

The Transaction is a fraudulent transfer because the Company is planning

the Transaction to purposefully divert cash and assets to insiders, leaving “remaining

assets” that are “unreasonably small” and debts that are “beyond [the Company’s] ability

to pay.” Each element of the Transaction individually constitutes a fraudulent transfer for

the same reasons.

44.

Alternatively, section four of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act provides

that a transfer is fraudulent if made “[w]ith actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any

creditor of the debtor.”

45.

The Transaction is a fraudulent transfer because it is intended to enrich the

insiders of the Company and to hinder the creditors, especially the Noteholders. Each

element of the Transaction individually constitutes a fraudulent transfer for the same

reasons.

46. Moreover, as to the Noteholders, whose claims arose prior to the

Transaction, a transfer is fraudulent under section five “if the debtor made the transfer or

incurred the obligation without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for

the transfer … and the debtor was insolvent at that time or the debtor became insolvent as

a result of the transfer.”

-14-

Case 0:09-cv-03664-JMR-FLN Document 1 Filed 12/21/09 Page 15 of 18

47.

The Transaction is a fraudulent transfer under section five because

CompuCredit is not receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the

Transaction and CompuCredit is insolvent or will become insolvent as a result of the

Transaction. Each element of the Transaction individually constitutes a fraudulent

transfer for the same reasons.

48.

Section seven of the Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act entitles Plaintiff to

relief, including “[a]voidance of the transfer or obligation to the extent necessary to

satisfy the creditor’s claim”, “[a]n injunction against further disposition by the debtor …

of the asset transferred or of other property”, or “[a]ny other relief the circumstances may

require.”

49.

Plaintiffs are entitled to both a preliminary and permanent injunction

enjoining the Transaction.

a. Plaintiffs will establish on the merits that the Transaction constitutes an

illegal fraudulent transfer.

b. Because the Transaction will serve to dissipate the Company’s assets

and cripple its ability to earn future revenue, if it is allowed to proceed,

Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable injury and will be left without any

adequate remedy at law.

c. The potential harm to Plaintiffs outweighs any harm likely to be

suffered by the Defendant by an injunction barring the Transaction.

d. An 

injunction barring the Company from proceeding with the

Transaction will not be adverse to the public interest.

-15-

Case 0:09-cv-03664-JMR-FLN Document 1 Filed 12/21/09 Page 16 of 18

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs requests a preliminary and permanent injunction barring

the Company from proceeding with the Dividend and the Spin Off or any other transfer

of assets without approval of the Court, as well as an award of any damages and costs.

COUNT II

Georgia Corporate Code

50.

Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-49 as though set forth fully

herein.

51.

The Georgia corporate code does not permit dividends if after the dividend

is paid, the Company would be insolvent on a balance sheet or cash flow basis.

Specifically, a dividend may not be made if, after distribution of the dividend, “[t]he

corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of

business” or “[t]he corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total

liabilities… ” Ga. Code Ann. § 14-2-640(c).

52.

The Company will not be able to meet its obligations under the Notes if it

makes the announced Dividend and/or the Company’s total assets would be less than the

sum of its total liabilities.

53.

Plaintiffs are entitled to both a preliminary and permanent injunction

enjoining the Dividend.

a. Plaintiffs will establish on the merits that the Dividend is barred by the

Georgia corporate code.

-16-

Case 0:09-cv-03664-JMR-FLN Document 1 Filed 12/21/09 Page 17 of 18

b. Because the Dividend will serve to dissipate the Company’s rapidly

dwindling assets, if it is allowed to proceed, Plaintiffs will suffer

irreparable injury and will be left without any adequate remedy at law.

c. The potential harm to Plaintiffs outweighs any harm likely to be

suffered by the Defendant by an injunction barring the Dividend.

d. An injunction barring the Company from proceeding with the Dividend

will not be adverse to the public interest.

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request a preliminary and permanent injunction barring

the Company from proceeding with the Dividend, as well as an award of any damages

and costs.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court:

1.

2.

3.

4.

Enter judgment in favor of Plaintiffs and against Defendant;

Grant Plaintiffs preliminary and permanent injunctive relief barring

Defendant from proceeding with the Dividend and the Spin Off or any

other transfer of assets without approval of the Court;

Award Plaintiffs their costs, disbursements, attorneys’ fees and witness fees

herein; and

Grant Plaintiffs such other and further relief as is just and equitable.

MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER TRANSFERING VENUE
JOHN R. TUNHEIM, District Judge.
The question before the Court is whether exercising jurisdiction over a lawsuit filed in Minnesota, while the same parties are currently involved in litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia after a venue change, is proper. The Court ordered the parties to submit simultaneous supplemental briefing on the issues of jurisdiction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 13(a), compulsory counter claims, and the doctrine of abstention, as outlined in Colorado River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976); see also Mo. ex rel. Nixon v. Prudential Health Care Plan, Inc., 259 F.3d 949, 953 (8th Cir. 2001). Both parties have responded. For the reasons set forth below, the Court transfers venue to the Northern District of Georgia.
BACKGROUND
The defendants in this litigation (collectively, "Noteholders") were plaintiffs in an earlier action brought in the District of Minnesota against CompuCredit Holdings Corporation ("CompuCredit"), who is the plaintiff in this action. Akanthos Capital Mgmt., LLC et al. v. CompuCredit Holdings Corp., Case No. 09-cv-3664 (D. Minn. Dec. 21, 2009) (hereinafter, the "Georgia litigation"). In that litigation, CompuCredit moved for a transfer of venue under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a), citing expense and the convenience of the parties. The Court granted the request for a change of venue to the Northern District of Georgia.
Within weeks of the transfer, CompuCredit filed suit in Minnesota alleging antitrust violations (the "Minnesota litigation"). (Docket No. 1.) The allegations in the Minnesota litigation are closely related to the issues in the Georgia litigation. For example, Noteholders' complaint in the Georgia litigation alleges that on December 3, 2009, CompuCredit announced a plan to give away $24 million and spin off a profitable subsidiary primarily to insiders. (Compl. ¶ 21-26, Docket No. 1). This announcement resulted in a dramatic drop in the trading prices of CompuCredit notes. After the drop in prices, CompuCredit initiated a tender offer for the notes at the lower prices. Noteholders boycotted this tender offer, which is a key fact in CompuCredit's antitrust claims in the Minnesota litigation. (Id.) Noteholders initiated the Georgia litigation to try to protect the value of their shares and were required to enter into settlement negotiations with CompuCredit, portions of which are now a part of the allegations of conspiracy in the Minnesota litigation. (Id. ¶78-79.)
DISCUSSION
"[A] district court should . . . consider[] abstaining from exercising jurisdiction in [a] case where a parallel . . . lawsuit is pending. Th[e] court may raise the issue of the appropriateness of abstention sua sponte." Cincinnati Indem. Co. v. A & K Const. Co., 542 F.3d 623, 624-25 (8th Cir. 2008) (discussing abstention in a case involving parallel federal and state claims) (internal citations omitted). Courts in other jurisdictions have similarly noted that federal courts should avoid duplicitous litigation ongoing in other federal courts, particularly when potentially compulsory counterclaims are involved. Nat'l Equip. Rental, Ltd. v. Fowler, 287 F.2d 43, 46 (2d Cir. 1961).
Further, 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a),1 the general transfer provision, provides: "For the convenience of the parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought." In analyzing a motion to transfer under § 1404(a), a district court employs a three-factor balancing test that considers "(1) the convenience of the parties, (2) the convenience of the witnesses, and (3) the interests of justice." Terra Int'l Inc. v. Miss. Chem. Corp., 119 F.3d 688, 691 (8th Cir. 1997). These factors are not exclusive, and a district court's decision on a motion to transfer "require[s] a case-by-case evaluation of the particular circumstances at hand and a consideration of all relevant factors." Id. Ultimately, a district court enjoys "much discretion" when deciding whether to grant a motion to transfer. Id. at 697. See also Cent. Reg'l Emps. Benefit Fund v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., No. 09-2125, 2010 WL 3515693, at *1 (D. Minn. Aug. 21, 2010).
In the instant case, the Court finds that the relevant factors to the decision to transfer venue are whether the issues raised in the Minnesota litigation could be considered compulsory counterclaims and whether the Colorado River doctrine of abstention is implicated.
I. Venue Considerations
In the Georgia litigation, the Court found that venue transfer was warranted primarily for the expense and convenience of the parties. Regarding the first factor of the balancing test, the Court noted that all of the parties are corporations, more than two-thirds of whom have no ties to Minnesota at all. Hr'g on Mot. to Change Venue at 34:19-20 (Docket No. 81), Akanthos Capital Mgmt., LLC et al., No. 09-cv-3664 (D. Minn. Mar. 19, 2010). Further, Noteholders claimed CompuCredit was insolvent, so the Court found that none of the parties would be served by the increased expense of litigating in Minnesota as opposed to Georgia, where CompuCredit is located. Id. at 34:15-20. Regarding the second factor, the Court also noted that the primary witnesses in the case were located in Georgia and that no fact witnesses were located in Minnesota. Id. at 35:18-36:6.
Finally, on the third factor, the Court noted the considerations for evaluating the interests of justice are "the relative familiarity of the two courts with the law to be applied, the relative ability of the parties to bear the expenses of litigating in a distant forum, judicial economy, the plaintiff's choice of forum, obstacles to a fair trial, and each party's ability to enforce a judgment." Id. at 36:7-17 (citing Graff v. Qwest Commc'ns Corp., 33 F.Supp.2d 1117, 1122 (D. Minn. 1999)). The Court determined the last consideration was not relevant and the others either carried no weight or were equally balanced, with the exception of the ability to bear the costs of the litigation. Id. at 36:18-39:4. Again, the Court cited CompuCredit's potential insolvency as determinative on this point. Id.
The Court finds that the earlier determination on these three factors is applicable to the instant litigation since the parties are the same and the issues to be litigated revolve around the same factual scenarios. The Court notes that the instant litigation presents further issues related to judicial economy and the interests of justice that support a transfer of venue that were not present in the Georgia litigation: the potential of compulsory counterclaims and Colorado River concerns of duplicative litigation.
II. Compulsory Counterclaims
While a claim that could be a compulsory counterclaim in a different litigation does not necessarily make venue improper, courts have noted that when "[t]here undoubtedly are judicial economy and preclusion issues involved . . . the availability of a counterclaim in [another court] is a factor to consider in determining whether to transfer the case pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a)." Jomico, LLC v. Traxys N. Am., LLC, No. 09-342, 2010 WL 2640100, at *4 (E.D. Okla. June 29, 2010) (emphasis omitted). Without determining precisely if claims were compulsory counterclaims, other courts have transferred cases to districts with pending litigation in part because "[e]ven if the cases are not ultimately consolidated, having the matters resolved in the same forum will increase the probability of consistent results." Neb. Beef, Ltd. v. Advanced Food Co., Inc., No. 8:09CV107, 2009 WL 2225816, at *3 (D. Neb. July 17, 2009); see also Avaya, Inc. v. Mitel Networks Corp., 460 F.Supp.2d 690, 692 (E.D. Va. 2006).
The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure state:
A pleading must state as a counterclaim any claim that — at the time of its service — the pleader has against an opposing party if the claim:
(A) arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim; and
(B) does not require adding another party over whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a)(1).
The allegations in the Minnesota litigation are factually intertwined with the claims asserted in the Georgia litigation. Indeed, one portion of the instant motion concerns settlement negotiations that occurred in the Georgia litigation prior to the venue transfer. The Eighth Circuit applies the "logical relation test" to determine if a counterclaim is mandatory. Tullos v. Parks, 915 F.2d 1192, 1195 (8th Cir. 1990). Under that test, compulsory counterclaims "may comprehend a series of many occurrences, depending not so much upon the immediateness of their connection as upon their logical relationship." Id. (citing Moore v. N. Y. Cotton Exch., 270 U.S. 593, 610 (1926)).
Under this test, the allegations in this complaint are logically related to those in the Georgia litigation since they are the reactions of two parties to each other's actions around the sale of the notes at issue. In this manner, the two lawsuits are intrinsically intertwined. The Court declines to determine whether the claims in the Minnesota litigation are actually compulsory counterclaims — this determination properly belongs with the court hearing the underlying claims. However, the Court finds that the probability that the Minnesota claims are compulsory in the Georgia litigation weighs in favor of transferring venue in the interests of justice.
III. Colorado River
The Supreme Court has noted that when an action in federal court is closely related to an action already pending in state court, prudential factors should be considered when deciding whether to exercise federal jurisdiction. Colo. River, 424 U.S. at 817-20. The principle of avoiding duplicative litigation is even stronger with regard to parallel proceedings in two federal courts. Id. at 817; see also Mo. ex rel. Nixon, 259 F.3d at 952-53. When faced with duplicative litigation, a court has at its disposal a "variety of mechanisms . . . to deal with this issue [such as] venue transfer . . . ." Mastro v. Momot, No. 09-01076, 2009 WL 1993772, at *2 (D. Ariz. July 9, 2009); see also Haworth, Inc. v. Herman Miller, Inc., 821 F.Supp. 1476, 1482 (N.D. Ga. 1992) ("Where exceptional circumstances, grounded on considerations of wise judicial administration, giving regard to conservation of judicial resources and comprehensive disposition of litigation, exist, a district court may decline to review a case where proper jurisdiction exists or transfer the case to a more appropriate venue." (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Colorado River, 424 U.S. at 817)). Given identical parties and the similarity of issues presented in the instant case, the Court finds that the Colorado River principle of avoiding duplicative litigation is a relevant factor in the interests of justice weighing in favor of venue transfer.
In sum, the Court determines that the convenience of the parties and witnesses weighs in favor of venue transfer. Further, for the interests of justice, the purpose of judicial economy, and to avoid potentially duplicitous proceedings with contradictory outcomes, the Court transfers venue for the instant case to United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia through its discretionary power under 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a).
ORDER
Based on the above considerations, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that this case is transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia.


FootNotes 
1. Under Section 1404(a), a court must first determine whether the action "might have been brought" in the proposed transferee district. However, given that the Minnesota District Court previously reached this conclusion with regard to the same parties and over intrinsically similar factual allegations, this Court does not repeat this analysis. Hr'g on Mot. to Change Venue, Akanthos Capital Mgmt., LLC et al., Case No. 09-cv-3664 (D. Minn. Mar. 19, 2010).
