Mitchell Feiger
Okay. Thank you, Austin. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us again today. I think this morning Randy is going to lead off our call providing the detail that you need to better understand our recent operating performance. Then I'll make an attempt to put a strategic context around that performance. And lastly, as usual, we’ll make a valiant attempt to answer every one of your questions, so Randy?
Randall Conte
Thanks Mitch, and good morning, everyone. So I'm going to jump right in since I’d like to highlight some specific items that we tried to call out in our release, but I wanted to make sure you got my perspective as well as a little more detail. So operating earnings for the second quarter were $47.8 million and the operating earnings per common share were $0.54. This was a 10% decrease from the $0.60 per share in Q1 on its face and deserves some explanation.
So first of all, the $6 million increase in provision, which was entirely associated with our loan growth in the quarter in excess of loan growth in Q1 had a $0.04 impact on our operating earnings per common share. Increased tax expense of $2.5 million in the quarter, resulting from a reduction in the tax benefit recorded on our stock-based compensation had a $0.03 impact on our operating earnings per common share. And a $4.3 million decrease in promotional income in our Leasing Segment which is lumpy each quarter had a $0.03 impact on our operating earnings per common share. These negative items were offset by $6 million increase in net interest income, which had a positive $0.04 impact on our operating earnings per common share. The net result of these items is a negative $0.06 impact which is the difference between the two quarters.
Although not an increase from Q1, this is not the big decline shown on the face of our earnings release especially when one considers the excellent loan growth and the impact that the growth will have in our future. The continued outstanding credit quality, the growth in our net interest margin, which is in line with our guidance. As I will explain a little later, the well-controlled core non-interest expense which is also in line with our guidance and expectations.

Let's talk a little bit more about our net interest margin, which increased 4 basis points to 3.54% excluding accretion. Our earning asset yields were up 9 basis points almost entirely due to the increased interest rates. The impact of our loan growth had a more limited impact on net interest margin as much of our growth was late in the quarter.
Prepayment penalties and reaccruals of interest income associated with loans coming out of non-accrual status, where the lowest they’ve been in the last eight plus quarters. They were $1.5 million of the average this quarter which was a 3 basis point impact on our net interest margin. That’s a good thing. However, the average cost of funds was up 6 basis points as a result of an unfavorable shift in our liability mix and increased rates in interest sensitive deposits in wholesale funds.
Specifically, although we had solid growth in low cost deposits of approximately $179 million in the quarter that growth was far short of our loan growth, which resulted in a $443 million increase in short-term borrowings with a weighted average cost of 1.09% at June 30.
Additionally, we have experienced increasing pricing pressure in our marketplace as more customers are starting to react to rising interest rates. In Q1, Mitch highlighted deposit growth is one of the biggest issues facing banks are size and how right it was. Growing low cost deposit, it is strategic priority for us in our Banking Segment, as this is the pursue to customers and business opportunities that key type balances of low cost deposits.
Our prepaid card business is a great example of this, with non-interest bearing deposits of over $300 million as of June 30. Loan growth already highlighted, but it's worth repeating was $675 million in the quarter with over $450 million from our commercial businesses, spread nicely across a middle market, C&I, specialty lending, commercial real estate leasing and asset-based lending businesses.
Residential real estate loans increased as well by $184 million point-to-point and our in direct loans we're up $54 million. We do not expect residential real estate loans to grow at this pace in the second half of the year. Expectation is for the growth to be well below $100 million in future quarters. Credit quality continues to be excellent and nearly all fronts with no issues to know in the quarter. And earlier in my comments, I mentioned that I wanted to go a little deeper on expenses. So I’m going to do that now.
On the surface core and non-interest expense after adjusting for merger and repositioning expenses has grown by approximately 2% as compared to last quarter. But this is not the entire story. Adjusting for the number of days in the quarter and excluding commissions in OREO gains and losses in the last three quarters, our non-interest expense is increased 1% in Q2. But more importantly, it's down 1.3% from Q4.
I continue to expect expense growth to be in the low single-digits for the year. And before I forget, since I called out computer expenses in Q1 and they did tick up a little this quarter, I feel compelled to point out that those expenses are well below the last two quarters of 2016. But it's important to know that almost all of this increase expense in the second quarter is due to the earlier than projected use of our commercial on line banking system.
In essence, this means that we were paying for two systems during the quarter. We will only be paying for one system in Q3 and beyond. That's what I wanted to cover at the top of the house just a little more on our Leasing and Mortgage Segments as a general banking highlights they already covered equally applied to our Banking Segment.
Other than I did want to mention that our new commercial on line banking system implementation was completed in the second quarter is advertised when we last spoke, and it's been a great success so far. Our new technology is ease-to-use, it's intuitive and its industry-leading when we feel like this is now puts as a competitive advantage and I believe it's indicative of things to come on the technology front for MB.

On our Leasing Segment, we set for a long time that the way to look at this business is to look over a longer time horizon and they can be a little lumpy. So here's the short version. Operating earnings were down $1.8 million from Q1 and essentially flat year-to-date as compared to the prior year.
However, the $4.3 million decrease in promotional revenue in the quarter I mentioned earlier accounts for all of that more as promotional revenue was unusually high in Q1 and unusually low in Q2. By the way in three out of the last four years, our promotional revenue was low in Q2. All other leasing revenue excluding promotional revenue is actually up 10% in Q2 and 16% as compared to the first half of 2016.
Absent and surprised by year-end, we believe our Leasing Segment will show a nice improvement in revenue and profit over 2016, and the significant investments that we've made in business development should keep the Leasing Segment continue to grow. As we said many times, we like this business. Total assets have grown 18% in the last 12 months and the returns on equity are substantial.
Lastly, our Mortgage Segments net income of $2.4 million for the quarter and $4.1 million year-to-date is on the low end of our expectations. Like much of the industry, production volumes for us were up compared to Q1, but down from last year. Gain on sale margin was down 9 basis points at 1.38%, which is about half of the increase from the fourth to the first quarter.
But our business mix is headed in the right direction as we continue to see increased purchase volume as well as an increased contribution from our retail and consumer direct channels to total division production both of which are key strategic goals for our mortgage business.
Lastly, we continue to be very focused on lowering our fixed and our variable cost to perform acceptably in all rate environments. Before I close, we expect our net interest margin to be flat to slightly increasing in Q3, as we get the full benefit of the June rate increase, but we caution that this could be offset by deposit pricing pressures and possibly unfavorable mix change, especially if long growth continues at the same pace as it did in the second quarter. Mitch?
Mitchell Feiger
Okay. Thank you, Randy. There are several things I like about our performance in the second quarter. One is obviously a loan growth. We've worked hard to improve our loan origination capability and it paid off this quarter. Furthermore, the number of business units we have that can drive loan growth and our ability to dial up and dial down the volume of new adjustable rate residential loans we retained in our balance sheet makes me feel quite good about our loan growth prospects going forward.
This is a new thing for me and I think it adds a new performance dimension to our Company. The great funding base, great fee businesses, and an ability to grow loan seems like a powerful combination to me. Another thing I liked about our quarter is that we're doing a good job sticking to the strategic plan we've been telling you about for years and it’s working. Our core goal is to build a higher return lower risk business. This means having a balance sheet with superior profitability and lower risk and ability to consistently grow high quality loans at a healthy pace really helps.
It also means having a great funding pace. Great banks have great deposit basis. By the way building a great very low cost deposit base is getting harder. And I think it will continue to get harder perhaps much harder as very large banks steadily increase their share of the consumer banking market. At the end of the second quarter, 45% of our deposits were non-interest bearing. In addition, non-interest bearing deposits grew by around 11% annualized in the quarter.

Half the acquisitions have helped built our deposit base, of course, but our focus on growing businesses and products that generate low cost deposits as well as fees has helped a lot. Furthermore, those businesses are getting bigger as is their ability to contribute to our deposit fee and profit growth.
Our strategy calls for controlled risk loans and low credit costs. No issues here, credit quality is great. I think we all need to remember that the economic environment including steadily increasing asset prices has made seemingly good credit easy and mask poor credit practices. One day those poor credit practices will come to light.
I should also comment that we're trying to maintain conservative principles regarding provisioning for loan losses. We intend to maintain a healthy allowance for loan losses considering the entire loan lifecycle. For commercial related loans which are 82% of our loans outstanding and a greater percentage of loan commitments.
For commercial related loans, we reserve at the time of loan origination for losses over the life of the loan. The actual percentage reserve depends on loan mix, but in the second quarter we reserved on average around 1.35% of the balance of each new commercial loan originated.
Thus the large increase in our provision for loan loss at this quarter is loan growth was very strong. Our strategy calls for great high return fee businesses. In this regard, we are focusing on leasing, capital markets, international banking, cards, treasury management, wealth management and mortgage and we are making good progress in all of them. They [don't know all] - produce steady unchanging profits each quarter, but I'd rather have a business that produces a 30% return on capital at one quarter and 40% another than one that produces 8% steady.
Finally, we continue to invest aggressively in human talent. Our investment is centered on sales and sales support staff in a number of key business lines. We've also focused on technology and projects support staff, and as always our leadership development program, which trains college graduates in the broad art of Commercial Banking.
All right. That's our report to you this quarter. At this time, we’re happy to take your question. So Austin, if you can open the line for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Sure. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Young with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Michael Young
Hey, good morning.
Mitchell Feiger
Good morning.
Randall Conte
Good Morning.
Michael Young
Randy, I wondered if we could start maybe just on the mortgage side. Can you talk a little bit about - just provide a little more color on the gain on sale compression and without any efforts by you all to take market share or something else?
Randall Conte
Sure. We can certainly hit on that. Well, first of all, I think compression is - we're trying to be competitive in the marketplace for sure. But we don't have any special pricing coming on in terms of trying to go after market share. So you have to remember our mix of business is - although, it changed positively as I pointed out from what was an 80%, 83% wholesale to retail business.
Our wholesale business being the 83%, 80%, it's now much less than that. But the margins in the wholesale business are much tighter than retail. And as we shift our mix towards retail, we expect our gain on sale to increase accordingly. But right now, even if I look at Q1 to Q2, the reduction in margin is much more substantial on the wholesale side of the business than it is in retail. But to come back to your question, we're not pricing that take share per se; we're trying to be competitive in the markets we serve.
Mitchell Feiger

Yes. Just one added comment here on the market in general. Traditionally as volumes have declined in the marketplace, say, because rates rose, margins in the business decline as well. So volumes and margins in this business unfortunately move in the same direction, right? Volumes down, margins down. Or reverse volumes up, margins up when rates go down, and rates are up a little bit. I'm actually pretty pleased with the way margins have reacted for us and in the industry given the somewhat higher rates. We'll see as rates continue to move up and down what happens.
Michael Young
And then maybe just a bigger picture question on the same business. Mitch, how are you kind of measuring success and where are you trying to get? Do you have any guideposts there in terms of moving the business mix shift? And then maybe just lastly, do you still talking about sort of the $10 million to $14 million net income contribution in the business this year?
Mitchell Feiger
Yes. I’ll take the last first. Yes, we're still eying $10 million to $14 million. I think its little harder this year now than we thought it was going to be, so I think it's more likely if we get in that range it's going to be at the lower end of the range than at the higher end of the range for this year.
But changes we're working to make in the business, we're hoping will increase that range and hopefully by a meaningful amount. Specifically we're working hard to increase the retail portion of our business and consumer direct. And we've made good progress I think in the second quarter on that and we're hopeful I think over the coming year that we're going to continue to make good progress in that.
Coincident with that and I think as retail goes up, our purchase volumes should go up as well and I think that helps a little bit especially if rates are up having higher purchase volumes or greater percentage of purchase volumes is essential to maintaining volumes.
With mortgage like every one of our business segments, business lines, product lines you name it. I mean it needs to return on appropriate return on capital and it's not there yet. But I think we're doing the right thing. I think our mortgage team is doing the right thing and I think it's going to get there. It's going to take more time and we've made progress. I think it's hard to see the progress, but we have made progress in that.
Michael Young
Okay. Thanks. I’ll step back for now.
Operator
Our next question comes from Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
Peter Ruiz
Hey, guys. This is actually Peter Ruiz on for Brad.
Mitchell Feiger
Hey, Peter.
Randall Conte
Hey, Peter.
Peter Ruiz
Maybe just looking at the NIM first. Obviously, you guys mentioned the deposit pricing pressures and I appreciate all the color that you gave around the moving parts and everything. But I just kind of wanted to get your thoughts on just the general. What's driving deposit pricing pressure? Is it increased competition among the other local banks? Is it bigger banks coming in? Or are you kind of maybe doing some one-time specials to drive up certain areas?
Randall Conte
Sure. Hey, this is Randy. I can start; certainly Mark or Mitch can hop in, right. So I sit in a regular pricing committee that we have here just to kind of see what's going on in the marketplace and especially on the retail side of the equation. Maybe Mark you can cover commercial pressures that you are seeing.
But certainly to start off on the consumer side, retail side, we're seeing a lot of local competition right now. And I think someone said the other day that the best thing for papers, believe it or not has been banks advertising for different specials whether they be CD specials or money market specials et cetera.
So we're seeing a lot of local pressure and we're seeing a lot of customers they come in with sheet in their hand and says that the bank down the street is offering a higher rate. So we're trying protect our customer base certainly and our good customer base and that's when we will tend to see what we can do.

Also I would say that there are specials out in the marketplace that are run from time-to-time. I think we've tried one here or there and we've had decent results from those. But that's kind of my view on what's going on. If you will, the number of the frequency of which our consumer customers are coming in and with - what can you do from a rate perspective? It certainly picked up over the last, I would say quarter-to-quarter and a half.
Mark, do you want to cover commercial?
Mark Hoppe
Sure. Thanks, Randy. This is Mark Hoppe. On the commercial side, I think there - it's a little bit of a combination a feed off what Randy just said. We're seeing some indication from the commercial side about rates. But it's primarily our client base, it's really financial oriented, right and they're being - they're right on top of it and every check is meaningful to them and they understand it, and et cetera. So we're seeing pressure there.
I think in the general, commercial population probably not so much. But what we are seeing - so the second part of it is, which I think Randy and Mitch both pointed out very well is we had very nice deposit growth and most of it was really in - was in commercial, right when our commercial client base and new clients that we added. So it was around $180 million in deposits. We feel good about that.
I will say we also feel very, very good about what our - the amount of loan growth that we had. So $675 million quarter-to-quarter point-to-point is a tremendous amount of growth for us. We're glad we did it. We're proud of it and we continue to move forward. But that means you've got about $400 million some that you’ve got to get elsewhere. And as we pointed out I think well in the release last night and you mention specifically borrowing that additional amount of money is going to have an impact on the NIM.
And so we're really happy with the growth and what we're doing internally as we have for a long time is continue to encourage our relationship managers to - in addition to looking for loans, be looking for a great deposit opportunities and I think we are doing that. But this quarter I think was a pretty good example of what happens to NIM when you have great loan growth, but you've got to fund approximately two-thirds of it with borrowings.
Mitchell Feiger
Yes. I agree with everything Mark and Randy said. I just had one more thing. I don't think that consumer deposit pricing pressure is strong as much at all. They are always rate sensitive deposit shoppers and we've reached out to some of them given our strong loan growth in the quarter, but rates are only up about 100 basis points now in short rates and CD rates.
I don't believe that they've moved far enough yet where the bulk of consumers are going to be rate shopping and moving money out of their money markets and now savings accounts in the cities. If rates keep rising, we'll get there. And then we'll really be talking about upward rate pressure, but I don't think we're there yet.
Peter Ruiz
Got it. Appreciate all the color. That’s great. Maybe just on the loan side, obviously the core loan yields were up really nicely. Just maybe kind of expecting similar performance in the third quarter given the full June rate hike and then maybe just in terms of the accretion? Obviously, you spoke last quarter about how it come down and I feel like kind of match the expectations. Does it sort of stabilize here or does it take another leg down?
Randall Conte
Sure I can start. This is Randy. Let’s take the second question first. I think we were expecting on the accretion side, it’s about $6.7 million and we are expecting that to come back - of course the numbers can move and can change, but we're expecting that to come down maybe $500,000 to $1 million or so. So it continues to tick its way down as time unfold. So that’s kind of the second question. The first question was loan yields and what our expectation, and yes, I believe we are expecting similar kind of performance out of - on the loan side of the equation, so as we did in the first quarter.

Peter Ruiz
Great, appreciated guys. That’s it for me.
Operator
Our next question is from Nathan Race with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Nathan Race
Hey guys. Good morning.
Randall Conte
Hey Nathan. Good morning.
Nathan Race
Just maybe ask the margin question in a different way and just going back to Mark's comments earlier. The expectation that the commercial growth that you're going to be putting on in the back half of this year going to be kind of net spread accretive, given kind of where you guys are funding your growth both on the wholesale end with deposit cost potentially further increasing going forward?
Mark Hoppe
This is Mark. I'm not sure exactly what you mean by accretive. Is that I mean the NIM?
Nathan Race
Just in terms of kind of the net spread, in terms of the loans over what your funding at, is that going to be accretive to where your current kind of net spread is around the 346 range?
Randall Conte
Probably net margin, is that the question. So our new loan at a wider spread than the current book.
Mark Hoppe
I don't have that right in front of me, but I can tell you that I know that we're expecting that. What I don't have is I don't have the spread if you will, right. I don't have the projected spread. So I don't want to - as it take too much, but we're certainly expecting the pickup on the yield side, I just don't have the expected spread.
Nathan Race
Okay. That’s fine. Perhaps changing gears little bit on the leasing side of things, are you guys seen anything from the comparison standpoint in the marketplace that impacting the overall profitability and just the revenue growth opportunities that you guys are seeing across the country and also in Canada as well?
Mark Hoppe
From my perspective - this is Mark. It's very competitive. That has not changed. And we certainly are getting opportunities and I think we're capitalizing on those opportunities, as you can see the growth is really all the way across the board in our commercial sector. But it's challenging out there, and I think there clearly is a margin impact on the business because the marketplace is so competitive.
We've talked about it for a long time. I can't remember. I called it. We've had since - in the last three years that hasn’t talked about and talked about the level of competition which is great. And one of our - as we’ve mentioned in the past, we'll continue to - our diversification in the lines of business, and our diversification from a geographic perspective in our loan origination, we think is really, really important and we think that's a particular benefit that we have. With our AVL business being national, with our Healthcare business being national with many of our - our Leasing businesses being national.
So we think that helps us a little bit as it relates to that, but I can't even - any one of those businesses as you look at them individually and they're very competitive when they - when they are out in the marketplace. I hope that answers helps or not.
Nathan Race
Yes. That’s helpful. I appreciate you guys taking the questions.
Mitchell Feiger
Sure.
Operator
Our next question is from Kevin Reevey with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.
Kevin Reevey
Good morning, guys.
Mitchell Feiger
Hello, Kevin. Good morning.
Kevin Reevey
So just looking at your commercial online banking platform given the adoption, do you anticipate kind of rethinking and kind of relooking at your branch footprint? And if so what are the plans there?
Mitchell Feiger
Okay. So the commercial online platform that we adopted is targeted at our larger - at our middle market companies and larger. So I don't think it has a direct impact on our branch footprint.
Kevin Reevey
Okay. And then on the C&I side, you had some pretty strong loan growth linked quarter. Can you talk about the specific industries or sectors where you are seeing a growth and is that more for - was that growth more for CapEx or working capital?

Mark Hoppe
This is Mark. One thing I can - I alluded to it before and Randy did as well as Mitch in their remarks, that it's very broad over - the growth is very broad over our different lines, so whether it was our commercial C&I business which is - you can say primarily Chicago Metro kind of Midwest, you know local states here are commercial specialty which would be more geographically diverse, ABL would be geographically diverse, CRE which is primarily Chicago or Midwest oriented. So it's broad from that perspective.
As it relates to industries, we’ve got - it's also very diverse, the industry. I don't think there are any real industry sectors that were more pronounced than others. And I would say that probably more would be working capital other than our commercial real estate most would be working capital. I would say the higher percentage of working capital is fixed, but Mike Morton I think would like to make a comment here.
Michael Morton
Yes. Just a follow-up to the comments. In general, our ABL business is predominantly working capital and the real estate, of course, as you guys know is predominantly long-term finance. CapEx is a smaller component, but generally there is optimism growing working capital needs across the customer base.
Kevin Reevey
Great. That’s helpful. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from Chris York with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
Christopher York
Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. So it appears you didn't reference an update to loan growth guidance, but we are halfway through the year and loan growth is up I think close to 7% which would be at close to your mid-to-high single-digit growth estimates. So should we expect second half of the year loan growth to be modest?
Randall Conte
Look I would expect the second half of the year to be consistent with our guidance. Our guidance wasn't - I guess when I put it out there, I wasn't thinking about a particular one-year period 2017. And so if the first half of 2017 is stronger the second half would be weaker and it’s kind of a forward-looking statement saying we expect mid-to-high single-digit loan growth and I think that still the case.
Christopher York
Okay, fair enough. And then in early May, you announced addition of the healthcare banking team. So the question is maybe twofold. Other commercial lending verticals that are attractive to you and if the right opportunity like that presented itself, couldn’t make you a strategic acquirer of what people are more teams? And then secondly, was it the teams hire included in previous guidance metrics?
Randall Conte
Yes, those teams were included in the previous guidance metrics. I can't think of another vertical. But that is immediate interest to us at the moment.
Mark Hoppe
Right, but plus the fact that with healthcare, we have a substantial healthcare business already. And so this is a terrific opportunity to add some really, really strong experienced healthcare bankers and so we seized the opportunity. But it was like this is some new ideas something that we were pretty deep in right now and this just gives us an opportunity to ramp up our growth in that sector.
Christopher York
Got it, it makes sense. And then maybe Randy or Mark, what was the weighted-average yield on new loans originated in the quarter?
Randall Conte
Sure. Weighted-average yield on a new loans - hold on a second, I'll find it for you. Let’s say about 4.10%.
Christopher York
4.10%, okay. Lastly, so help me reconcile kind of your comments about investing drastically in technology and then maybe the movements in the line for computer services and tech because I mean as we spoke about, it didn't change very much, which is great, but just how to think about that in context of that line going forward with potentially future investment?

Randall Conte
Yes, sure. This is Randy. I'll take it and certainly anyone else can jump in. So let's talk about the investments, right. So first of all we talked about the commercial online banking. There's an example - Mitch and talked about the investments we're making and technology generically. So - but we've been investing in people, first of all on the technology side where we can start to take a little bit of control over our destiny right.
We've been historically a buyer of systems and buyer as we're in a service providers are given a systems and we're looking at where we can actually step in and where we can make a - where there is a competitive advantage for us to internally do some development work and control our destiny on go forward basis. So that's an example of investment.
One, I've got another one that's extremely important of that as well. And we've done some of that development already. We certainly work the team worked on commercial online banking system the team has recently rolled out some system that helps make the asset-based lending business, much more effective and efficient.
So we think we can extend that out to other parts of the organization. We're looking at some of our mobility if you will and capabilities there. Those are some examples and we've got some people that are more directed in the back office to try and figure out how we can make our operational folks more efficient through the use of technology that we develop and so we can adjust and build from there and make ourselves more efficient and be speed, right the speed is very important, so that's one.
Two, just even more important than that right now anyway is what we're doing from an infrastructure perspective because of the word itself right infrastructure. So we're looking and have, and well down. I shouldn’t say looking, we're well down the path of consolidating, our infrastructure in terms of our datacenters into - and as well as putting in all our new technology, new infrastructure if you will.
So we're bringing ourselves way up to-date. Consolidating from I'd say almost 4.5 datacenters down to two going to a more of a co-located colo environment, which will make us more efficient, it's much less expensive in terms of facilities.
The power is much more consistent than the business continuity, the security et cetera. So those are some things we're doing from an infrastructure perspective. What that will mean is again speed the market, the ability to spin up servers, the ability to software-as-a-service, infrastructure-as-a-service. All of that kind of stuff we see in our very, very near future, which I think will help everybody in the bank.
And going to things like that in Office 365 and productivity tools for the individual employees should start to pick up dramatically from what we've had in the past. So we'll be able to do some things in the office to other offices that will help with our productivity from a number of perspectives. So that’s the - unless Mitch you wanted to offer and add anything? Did that answer that question before I get into the specifics of the line itself?
Christopher York
Yes. I mean that color is tremendously helpful in providing two of those examples and kind of going through that infrastructure internally, so yes, no it was.
Mark Hoppe
Okay. So then let's take the specific line of expense if you will. So the thing that’s interesting about the whole solution on the infrastructure side is it literally is the best we can imagine, right. If you think about it we're making all those investment, but it was actually going to make us more effective from an expense perspective per se, not only the productivity, not only the ability to speed the market, but it's going to be cheaper for us, less expensive on a go forward basis.

And on that front, we did a - we're doing a lot of contract, looking at our contracts, so we had a major contract that came up at the end of the year that we were able to negotiate several others that we've been negotiating and that's driving our expense in that roll if you will down. So I was trying to explain with my little comments that albeit the expense went up roughly $400,000 or $500,000, I think it was $400,000 or $500,000 from the first quarter to second quarter.
And the totality - almost all of that expense base is, is a result of the fact that something good, right. We rolled out our commercial and implemented our commercial online banking system a whole quarter in essence ahead of it and then some a little bit more than a quarter ahead of when we had hoped to do and expected to roll it out.
And as a result of that we've negotiated ourselves into a position where we had to keep that second system for a period of time, so we paid for two systems throughout the - in the second quarter and for part of the first as well. So that's what I was trying to get at with my comments around the expense line itself. Did that help?
Christopher York
It did. Thank you very much for that color. That's helpful in thinking about it. And that's it for me, so thanks for taking the questions.
Mark Hoppe
Sure.

Our next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. Please go ahead.
Kelly Motta
Hi. This is Kelly Motta on for Chris McGratty.
Mark Hoppe
Hi.
Kelly Motta
So looking at your loan-to-deposit ratio is obviously up quite a bit from last year without the growth you’ve been seeing. I was wondering if there's room to move higher than this and how we should be thinking about funding the loan growth that you continue to expect.
Randall Conte
Yes. Sure this is Randy. I'll take a piece of that and then obviously others can jump in, so we've done some work on that just to kind of if you will click through that number because it was - we’ve seen the increase along with all of you. So what's interesting about that is some portion - some large portion of our loans that are in there on the resi loans can actually be funded and are funded through advances if you will, right.
So when we start to look, we took our loan-to-deposit ratio and kind of bifurcated it into resi versus the rest of the portfolio and that gets that ratio down, right into the 86, 87 range when you exclude resi mortgages from the calculation. So we feel like - to answer your first question, we have some more room there right, certainly from a loan deposit ratio. I don’t - Mitch, if you want to comment feel free, so that's kind of my view on the loan deposit ratio.
Mitchell Feiger
I think there's a little bit of room. So residential mortgage loans are up about $650 million from a year-ago and so that's been a primary mover of the increase in our loan-to-deposit ratio. But as Randy pointed out, they are more easily financeable than other kinds of loans, so it helps a little bit. That said, our loan deposit ratio is getting up there and I don't see it moving debt. If it moves higher, it can't - there isn’t enough room to move it that much higher, so we're looking hard at it.
And we have an ability to drive more deposits and we will if we need to, if we get to a position where we just are uncomfortable with, a broader measures of liquidity, loan deposit ratio is the only one we look at surely. If we get uncomfortable with where we're at, we'll just drive more deposits as long as the marginal business provides the right returns on capital.
Kelly Motta
Okay. Thanks for that. I know in your prepared remarks, you focused more on utilizing your internal business channels for deposit generation. As you said just now, you have more levers to pull should you need that. But could you talk about your appetite for M&A particularly on the deposit side, and if you’re looking at that as a way to bolster your strong deposit base?

Randall Conte
So your question is would we be interested in acquiring a deposit rich company that otherwise is healthy?
Kelly Motta
Yes.
Randall Conte
Yes. And we've made I don't know a couple of dozen acquisitions since I've been at this Company that look just like that. But that said, and as I've commented a number of times in prior calls, the number of institutions that meet that profile, meaning high quality and deposit rich is very limited now. So the opportunity for the limited the chances that we could execute on one of those I think is lower, maybe quite a bit lower than it was in previous years.
Kelly Motta
Okay. Thanks for that. And then the last question I have. With your NIM guidance, I know you said that you expect deposit cost to continue to go up with that, but I was wondering what sort of deposit beta you're factoring in when thinking about your foreign NIM trajectory?
Randall Conte
Yes. So this is Randy. And we've kind of - it’s not as easy as it sounds, right, because we've kind of taking different betas on the different categories of deposits as we look forward. So our beta is what, [24] I believe and I think it's slightly higher than that on a go forward which is what we're using from the modeling perspective.
Mitchell Feiger
Yes, but it's really complicated, right. Some deposits will have very high betas and others will have a beta that's zero. So the mix matters are lot and it's a really hard question to answer with a single, unfortunately with the single number. And by the way, our forecasts are - well they're probably as good as any, none of our deposit beta forecasts are going to be very accurate I think. Because you’re dealing with consumer behavior and none of us - nobody I know is really good at predicting consumer behavior in this kind of situation especially considering, really haven’t been here before.
So [indiscernible] I've heard this before, either it’s caution on people thinking about NIM expansion for our Company and for the industry. I'm not saying we're unusual relative to the industry. I think everybody has very high hopes for NIM expansion and I wonder about that. Especially as rates go up and we hit that that consumer threshold that really makes them act on their deposits and nobody knows where that is.
Kelly Motta
Thank you so much.
Mitchell Feiger
Sure.
Operator
Our next question is a follow-up from Michael Young with SunTrust. Please go ahead.
Michael Young
Hey, thanks for the follow-up. Just wanted to go back to the lease promotion income Randy. Could you give us the amount maybe in the first quarter versus the second quarter, so we can just have a sense of that seasonality going forward?
Randall Conte
Sure. So a quarter that’s $4.3 million decrease difference and so I think that the end points are like $600,000, $700,000 on Q2 and $4.9 million is my memory on Q1, about right? My memory is accurate. We just confirmed that.
Michael Young
That’s good to hear. And then Mitch or Mark, maybe sort of bigger picture on just ACB bankers returning to lending this quarter for a full quarter. Would you kind of maybe qualitatively characterize that as some of the lift this quarter or was it still just broad-based outside of that?
Mark Hoppe
I wouldn't characterize it as a lift this quarter. But remember we hadn't Randy alluded to it a little bit different context. But for most of the quarter, we were working on converting clients in waves to our new online banking system and as we talked about it that that was a more major conversion than probably - certainly than any acquisition that has occurred because when you convert a new company via acquisition, you're just converting that company, right. That the customers from that banker financial institution. In this one, we converted every business client in our Company.

So we impacted every one of our commercial clients and so you can only imagine the effort that not only the IT people had, in our treasury management people had, in our ops people had, but every one of the relationship managers and every one of the support staff spent incredible amounts of time for much of the second quarter on that.
And as a result quite frankly our people including the ACB folks really not in the market as much as we would [like indeed], and but they - I feel anyway that they are beginning to hit their stride now and I'm saying that without having everybody's backlog it right in front of me right now, but I'm saying that we have - as I think we've mentioned all of you before, we have loan committee that meets twice a week and of course if there are things that can't wait.
We have other ways to make sure those get done with the right amount of oversight. But in committee, again we meet frequently, we're seeing more opportunities come up and I'm comfortable and with the place that our ACB, a legacy ACB obviously now MB Bankers are - I think they're feeling more comfortable and we're starting to see things move forward. Mitch?
Mitchell Feiger
Yes. Just to be clear about it, I agree with Mark said about the ACB Bankers. So their contribution in the second quarter was fairly neutral. So I wouldn’t call them contributors to loan growth, which is pretty exciting to be - because there's 40-plus of them and they are bringing in new relationships and they’re getting traction and I think that only grows from here. They're really doing a good job.
And I think what Mark was trying to allude to and he’s talking about the online banking system is the American Chartered people were particularly challenged in that. Their clients had just gone through a conversion only a few months before that. So this was the second time around, so they were particularly attentive appropriately, so their clients in this new commercial online platform, that move when it incredibly well, so worked out great. But I think consumable upside yet coming from that team.
Michael Young
Great color, I appreciate that and one last one Randy, real quick. Just on the NIM guide. Was that core or reported flat quarter-over-quarter?
Randall Conte
That is reported.
Michael Young
Reported, okay. So some benefit to the core margin just offsetting the decline in purchase accounting accretion?
Randall Conte
Yes.
Michael Young
Okay, thank you.
Randall Conte
Sure.
Operator
Our next question is from Brian Martin with FIG Partners. Please go head.
Brian Martin
Hey, guys.
Mitchell Feiger
Hi, Brian.
Randall Conte
Hi, Brian.
Brian Martin
Hey, maybe just one different way of thinking about, Mark or Mitch on the loan growth you know I guess any sense it didn't sound like there's any sense there's any cannibalization of future growth from what you saw this quarter. So I guess is that that's seen unfair or maybe just kind of seen where the pipelines are at today? How is the pipeline today versus where it was last quarter?
Randall Conte
I just want to make sure we got the question right. Your question is essentially did we pull loan growth forward, so growth that we otherwise perhaps would have seen in the third or perhaps fourth quarter question as to some of that show up in the second quarter, okay.
Michael Morton
Yes. This is Mike. Generally it's been my experience that loans push as opposed to pull forward in financing.
Brian Martin
Okay. And I guess maybe just the pipeline today, where does it stand relative to where it was last quarter?
Michael Morton
I think we’ve had a strong pipeline really across our different lines. I want to say for probably about three or four quarters in a row. And I think for the time of year and where we are in the cycle, I think this is very similar to where we have been. A lot of things went our way in the last quarter for the large amount of growth. If you recall the quarter before, that was not as strong. So we feel very good in all of our lines as it relates to where we are. It's moved a little bit the pipe from line to line, but in total it feels about the same as we were to coming into the second quarter.

Brian Martin
Okay. Perfect. And just other - couple other housekeeping. The tax rate as you kind of think about the second half of the year in 2018, how should we be thinking about that?
Mitchell Feiger
Hey, Brian. Same way we've been saying for forever. So the only thing I probably add to that is just obviously there's a change in the Illinois side of the equation and we have done some thinking around that and we think that’s about a 50 basis points in to the tax rate. John, you want to add anything?
John Francoeur
Yes. The only other thing is just the tax effects on the stock options. That can make it fluctuate a little bit too, so Randy is right on, but I think there can be some volatility going forward.
Brian Martin
Okay. And maybe Randy just on the mortgage mix, you kind of talked about as you kind of change the mix over time maybe seeing some opportunity there to build I guess to add to how much mortgage contributes. I mean can you just give kind of some color where the mix is today and I guess where it may be heading and we'd like to see it be heading over time?
Randall Conte
Yes. Sure. I was confused, so let me speak very clearly on this. So first of all the mix from a funding purpose was 70% purchase, which is - I don't remember when it was that going back to 2010 when we started this business, so 70% purchase, 30% finance, now funded by channel is 73% third-party, 27% retail. Again, maybe there's a point estimate out there where we had more in retail, if there is, I don't remember that. Mitch, I don't know if Mark…
Mitchell Feiger
That’s okay.
Randall Conte
So what - mix wise, geez I wish I had Philip on the phone or Brian, but I'm going to - if we could balance that off too and get that number from 20s into the mid to upper 30s that would be a good start from my perspective. And the idea is that just so we're clear at the moment, right. The idea would be to grow the retail side of the equation. The margins are very - are much higher and it's very hard to look at our gain and sale and compare it to a shop that's essentially all retail and you're just going to stare at that and say what the heck's going on and that's what's going on.
Brian Martin
Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just back to the loan portfolio, one question. Kind of your retail exposure, can you guys kind of quantify where that today and just maybe just how that portfolio is tracking performance wise? I guess I assume it's still very healthy at this point, but any color on the size and how it's tracking?
Randall Conte
And by retail - you're talking about shopping centers?
Brian Martin
Correct.
Randall Conte
Yes, okay.
Michael Morton
Brian, this is Mike. Let me start with just a little color on today's reported information and extrapolate a little bit. So if you look at our charge off numbers and you look at our 90-day is still accruing and you see how small those balances are. There's virtually no real estate in there and I can tell you there's no retail related real estate.
Stepping up a little bit, if you look at the non-performing loans that we show the whole CRE book reported there is $9.5 million of which there is no retail. On a bigger picture basis, this is less than 5% of the portfolio and we then of taking a little bit of a dive into that and we've looked at I guess what you would call national names. And over 60% of that portfolio contains none of the usual suspects with respect to national names.
40% of the portfolio has got some of the national tenant names, but that is represented by your typical fast food names at about 26% of the portfolio, drugstores at 14%, and your beverage retailers at 10% and then we get into some very small numbers, medium single-digit granularity in some of the other type of retail functions. And as Mitch alluded to, when you think about a strip center, it's your typical service type businesses and when it comes to the big box, we just don't have a lot.

Mitchell Feiger
Just to add, certainly scrutiny is elevated. We talk about it a lot. It's obviously in the media. But at this point we're not overly alarmed about what maybe in there and one last comment and I think our single largest retail exposure is about $14 million.
Brian Martin
Okay, perfect. That color is very helpful. Just and maybe the last thing for me and I’ll hop out. Was the - Randy you talked about the expense growth this year, I guess I think the 1% number you gave, I don't recall it. I guess if that - I guess assume that's just the core reported number?
And maybe the bigger picture question is, as you look to 2018, I mean you guys have done a good job on the expense side as far as managing that. I mean is there anything that would take the growth rate up and the expense is kind of in 2018, I guess if you think absent the mortgage, which has a fluctuation just kind of the Banking and Leasing, how do you think about the growth in expenses going forward?
Randall Conte
Yes, so I have no reason at this moment, right to think it's any other - any different than what we have right now. Having said that, we'll start our whole set of processes as it relates to really refining our view on 2018 and in the third quarter and fourth quarter - later in the third quarter and fourth quarter. So we'll see what kind of investments we want to make et cetera. But that will be offset from some of the efficiencies that I spoke to and alluded to earlier in the conversation. So I would stay with the same number as I sit here right now.
Brian Martin
Okay. I appreciate. Thanks for taking the questions.

Our next question comes from Brian Zabora with Hovde Group. Please go ahead.
Brian Zabora
Thanks. Good morning.
Mitchell Feiger
Hey, Brian.
Randall Conte
Hey, Brian.
Brian Zabora
Just the question of the provision expansion, it sounded like that maybe the loan growth going forward or can be more commercially focused and we dial back right here a bit. Should we think about the provision expense maybe being a bit higher than what we saw, maybe the first and second quarter? And maybe you guys in the second quarter given the strong growth with some work in between. Is that fair?
Randall Conte
Well, this is Randy. I'll start that's a hard one right. For but yes assuming the exact same thing right. This at the same scenario with less loan growth by the expected come back some.
Mitchell Feiger
Less loan growth and this and that recoveries that's right so I mean the pieces are you know we had absolutely and that recovery - whatever it's zero right and given the same fact pattern with less loan growth I'd expect that provisioning to come down from where it is, but we'll see.
Randall Conte
Actually it would be a good thing I suppose if the provision actually went up. Right I mean if we have net recoveries again in the provision goes up that means we had more loan growth.
Mitchell Feiger
That’s right.
Brian Zabora
I was just maybe referring to see that the shifting more towards commercial. So if I really got maybe past quarters, because as indicative looking at the provision expense versus [indiscernible] growth that given it sounds like more commercial, it might be at a higher rate than we've seen in the past, commensurate with growth. Is that kind of your fair way to look at it?
Randall Conte
I would probably, yes I mean it agreed that growth rotates from resi mortgage for example to commercial that the provisioning larger, which makes sense right in the risk of loss in a commercial loan is certainly greater than the risk of loss on an appropriately originate residential mortgage loan these days.
Brian Zabora
Great. Thanks for taking the questions.
Randall Conte
Absolutely.

The next question comes from Jason Oetting with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Jason Oetting
Hey. Good morning, everybody.
Mitchell Feiger
Hey, Jason.
Jason Oetting
Hi. Just one question for me, for interactive vehicle, if I recall correctly yours is not the typical auto portfolio, I know you concentrate more on RV and Motorcycle, so I’m just curious if you can provide an update on the risk profile there in terms of where you see on delinquency rates average FICOs and any other kind of updates you can provide?
Michael Morton
Yes. This is Mike. And we've discussed in general in the past. This is a seasonal business with major segments being motorcycles, power sports, and really over the last two and a half years expansion into the asset classes of boats and RV. The average FICO score, basically 65% of that portfolio is an average of over 740 and 90% of the portfolio has got an average FICO greater than 700. So the portfolio was holding up very, very well.
Actual demand is up per se. We've written more contracts quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter, but we're very pleased with the portfolio. No surprises. Durations are getting a little bit longer as we get more weighted in RVs and boats. Obviously, those loans have a longer term to them, but in general no surprises and very pleased with the growth.
Jason Oetting
Okay. Thanks for the color.

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mitchell Feiger for any closing remarks.

Good day and welcome to the MB Financial Quarter 1 2017 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] On the call today, we have Mitchell Feiger, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Randall Conte, Chief Financial Officer of MB Financial Incorporated. Also present from MB Financial Bank are Mark Hoppe, President and CEO; John Francoeur, Chief Accounting Officer; and Michael Morton, Chief Credit Officer.
Before we begin, I need to remind you, during the course of this call; the Company may make forward-looking statements about future events and future financial performance. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date made. These statements are subject to numerous factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected.
For a list of some of these factors, please see MB Financial's forward-looking statements disclosure in their 2017 first quarter earnings release. Also as a reminder, today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Mitchell Feiger, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead.
Mitchell Feiger
Okay, thanks, Ryan. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We are reporting to you a little later than usual this at because we wanted to have time to rework our earnings release. We are committed to provide with the best most useful, most timely, most reliable information we can. 
I think Randy and John and the rest of our financial reporting team is excellent improvements in our earnings release. As such we like the expanded mortgage disclosure. I hope you find it useful. Please let us know how you feel about our new format and what are the changes you’d like us to do.
I’ll begin our report to you this morning with a few general comments, Randy will follow with a more detailed review of our financial results and provide you with added insight into our performance, then we’d be happy to take your questions. So, our first quarter, I think is solid in almost all regards. Net income of $54.5 million compared to $47.2 million last quarter and $39.1 million in the first quarter last year.
Diluted earnings per share were $0.62 this quarter compared to $0.53 last quarter and $0.50 in the year ago quarter. Operating earnings per share increased around 7% annualized over the prior quarter and around 11% over the same quarter a year ago. Please see our earnings release for the definition of operating earnings, but generally it excludes what we consider to be non-core items.
Importantly, our return on average tangible common equity increased to over 15% this quarter and our return on average assets increased to 1.16%. Also most capital ratios increased meaningfully, we remained committed to building a high return, lower risk company that also happens to have good growth and I like our progress.
I also like the way our balance sheet and income statement responded to rising interest rates. Our net interest margin expanded 8 basis points while strong expense control helped to spend our mortgage earnings. 

The mortgage segment earned 41% more than last quarter and 69% more than the same quarter a year ago. Even though higher interest rate caused the volume of mortgages originated for sale has declined 25% from the last quarter and 22% from the same quarter a year ago. 
We still expect mortgage to earn between $10 million and $14 million this year assuming net interest rates don’t go crazy and rise dramatically. But, staying in that range will of course be harder if interest rates rise and mortgage origination volumes fall. 
Staying on the seam of rising interest rates, while we worked very hard to build a fantastic, stable, low cost deposit base and we believe we have an asset-sensitive balance sheet that will benefit from higher interest rates, I am not convinced that industry margins will respond to rising rates as people expect. 
For example if margin widens, as rates rise, will banks maintain their loan and deposit pricing disciplines or will they compete away some or all to gain margins. 
How will bank depositors react to rising rates? People keep the deposit data, but that’s a linear sense, depositors don’t behave linear only, they may very well could tight as rates rise and so we can’t stand anymore. 
Then they all move at once aggressively seeking higher returns on their money, which means margins would increase at first and perhaps increase again as rates rise and so depositors flock up higher retain products driving margins out from their highs or – if anyone gets. 
My point here is, we believe that having a diversified right balanced business model like MB has, will be beneficial when if rates rise having multiple loan sources especially within commercial categories having the best granular client needed deposits, having key businesses that can grow and provide high returns regardless of interest rates are all important. 
One other comment about rising interest rates. Some people have asked that how our leasing business and lease loans will respond to changing interest rates. Keep in mind that, things are generally short duration, fixed rate amortizing assets. 
The best thing for our leasing and leased loan businesses is a strong economy in which companies hedge capital and technology assets. In the past, high on interest rates have helped us well as companies lease more equipment rather than use their own cash or borrowings to fund equipment purchases. 
Getting back to the quarter and speaking of leasing, our leasing segment had a solid quarter and is well positioned to continue its growth and success which is a well performing, high return on capital business. I thought expense control was good across our company. Our challenge is and will be balancing expense control against making the investments we need to make and should make in our business, especially in technology. 
We are committed to building a more nimble operating platform that can respond quickly and in a highly customized way the client needs a market opportunity. This is especially important in some of our highest growth and highest ROE businesses including cards payments, treasury management, leasing and more. It’s also important that mobile and internet banking, it’s also important in helping us lower our operating cost in attracting and retaining the best talent possible, especially young talent. 
We are making those investments, and Randy will tell you about a successful one in a couple of minutes. One other thing you should know regarding expenses is that, we are closing five branches next month. These closures are mostly due to branch overlap caused by our recent American Chartered Bank acquisition. 
Moving on, credit quality was ridiculously during the quarter. I think things can’t get any better, but it did. I’ll be right at some point, next one maybe coming soon simply because non-performing loans we can’t go down much more. 

At the end of the first quarter, we had only $17.5 million of non-performing commercial-related loans and that’s on a $10.7 billion portfolio, even consumer-related non-performing loans are down, but they move in a much narrower range.
You can see all the data in our earnings release. Speaking of credits and loans, while commercial-related loan growth was negligible in the first quarter, our pipeline remains strong and we expect commercial loan growth to return. That, combined with continued residential mortgage in consumer loan growth should push overall loan growth to our prior guidance of mid to high-single-digits. 
All right, enough for me. I’ll turn it over to Randy. 
Randall Conte
Okay, thanks, Mitch and good morning everyone. So, I too hope that you speak you sync with our new earnings release format and added disclosure and we do welcome your feedback and we are going to reach out to you sometime in the near future to get that. 
And with that, I’d like to go into the highlights for the quarter which includes operating earnings of $53.2 million and operating and operating earnings per common share was $0.50. Net interest margin expansion was 8 basis points to 3.55% excluding accretion. This was led by an increase in loan yields. 
Continued strong credit quality metrics, as Mitch pointed out, on nearly all fronts highlighted by reduced non-performing loans and assets and net recoveries for the quarter. Lower than forecasted core non-interest expense with reductions in mortgage as well as consumer services expense leading the way. 
Overall loan growth of 1.5% or 1.6% annualized with residential real estate and indirect accounted for most of the growth. Total period-end deposits were down $111 million due mainly to a reduction in mortgage escrow balances and the sale of our Philadelphia branch in March, but also due in part to normal seasonal fluctuations.
Total low cost deposits make up 85% of our deposit base and our cost of deposits increased 1 basis point in year end. And lastly, strong returns on average assets at 1.16% while returns on average tangible common equity lowered 15%. In overall, I agree what Mitch has indicated and I think it’s a solid quarter consistent with our strategy of building a high performing diversified bank.
Other highlights included in our Banking segment, commercial loan growth was essentially flat in a seasonally low first quarter, but pipelines are strong. Net interest income was down $2.3 million as compared to Q4, due primarily to two less days in the quarter, partially offset by an increase in loan yields. 
Also in the commercial – sorry, also in the Banking segment, the reduction in total assets at period end due to the internal transfer of previously acquired residential real estate loans to our Mortgage segment. By the way, now nearly all of our residential real estate loans are managed by our mortgage experts. 
Non-interest income was up slightly to $41.9 million in the quarter with small increases in nearly every category except capital markets and International which declined due to lower customer interest rate swap fees in the quarter and reduced M&A fees and our key three initiatives continue to be a critical part of our overall strategy. 
American Chartered loans were down a little in the quarter. But we feel that’s a tide that’s turning now as our bankers are back in the marketplace and we are seeing growing pipelines. 
And lastly, in our Banking segment, we have successfully converted two-thirds of our commercial customers to our new commercial online banking system and have encountered no issues to speak of at all at this time. Our last customer conversion weight is scheduled in May. 
Our new technology is easy to use. It’s intuitive and its industry-leading. We feel like this now puts us at a competitive advantage and it’s clearly a huge step forward for our customers, our bankers and operations. 

Moving on, our Leasing segment had a strong quarter with $5.9 million in net income adjusting for the reversal of provision in Q4, our net income grew by 2.5% in the first quarter and it’s trending up nicely over the past five quarters. Non-interest income was up nearly $1.7 million in the quarter led by higher residual gains and promotional income. 
Expenses were up as well, but this is due mainly to increased commissions as a result of lower indirect capitalized costs. Our Mortgage segment, net income of nearly $1.7 million is in line with our expectations and guidance. Additional disclosures are included in this earnings release as Mitch pointed with breakdowns of mortgage origination and mortgage servicing revenue, as well as additional disclosure on our gain on sale and mortgage servicing assets. 
Mortgage origination revenue was down $8 million from last quarter with gain on sale margins declining 19 basis points from Q4 to 1.47% and a reduction in originated for sale mortgage volume of approximately $350 million. Mortgage servicing revenue increased by $3.4 million in the quarter mostly due to lower amortization and prepayments.
Non-interest expense decreased nearly $5.2 million in our Mortgage segment, much of this was due to changes in volume, but there has been substantial effort to impact our fixed cost in our Mortgage segment and it’s starting to show its salary and benefit expenses as well as computer services, and telecommunication expenses have all increased. 
And for the last time, as it’s getting harder to breakout, as American Chartered is fully integrated into our system and processes, our view on the transaction that our expense reductions are in line with our estimates and as we indicated earlier, we have five branch consolidations thus far – those are all on target. 
And last but not least, all estimates are in line with our projections at the time we announced the transaction. 
And before I close, we expect our net interest margin to be up slightly or slightly increasing I should say in this rate environment. Mitch?
Mitchell Feiger
Okay, thanks, Randy. Ryan, we will open up for questions now. Thanks.
Question-and-Answer Session 
Operator 
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Jason with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Jason Oetting 
Hey, good morning everybody.
Mitchell Feiger
Good morning, Jason.
Jason Oetting 
When we think about the deposit decrease tied to – there is a few items lower than mortgage escrow, the sale of the Philadelphia branch and just normal seasonality, can you quantify how much each of those – I remember it was more in mortgage and the Philly branch.
Randall Conte
Sure, hey, this is Randy. It’s around $53 million, $54 million, and I would call it $55 million on the mortgage side, up $40 million on the branch sale and the less due to normal seasonal fluctuations. 
Jason Oetting 
Okay, great. Thanks. And then, I know it’s too – switching to margins, I guess the savings deposit breaking down 1 basis point quarter-over-quarter. Just curious if there is anything noteworthy there or any detail on what drove that down?
Randall Conte
Hey, this is Randy again. I just want to make sure I understood the question since it was a little bit of an interruption there. Could you just repeat it for me?
Jason Oetting 
Yes, savings deposit rates down 1 basis point, just curious what drove that?
Randall Conte
Nine basis points, no there is nothing unusual there.
Jason Oetting 
Okay. And then just to clarify to with the five branch closures coming up, that was already contemplated in the cost savings right?
Randall Conte
That’s correct. 
Jason Oetting 
Great. Thank you.
Randall Conte
Sure.
Operator 
Our next question comes from Brad Milsaps with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.

I think, Randy, the level of accretion income has been pretty consistent the last few quarters. Since your – what is your crystal ball say there in terms of kind of timing and what about recognition, say for the balance of the year and into 2018?
Randall Conte
Sure. I would say, it’s fairly consistent to maybe a little down. I think it’s down $500,000 to $800,000 from last quarter if my memory serves me and – but in terms of any changes in guidance or thought process around it is staying pretty true to what we’ve talked about before. 
Brad Milsaps 
Okay. And then was there any provisioning this quarter related to the acquired loans or is all that pretty much to the legacy book?
John Francoeur
This is, John. We continue to provide through the acquired loans on a quarterly basis, so they start renewing if we do provide for those. So that’s going to be – we’d be continuing that consistently since the – pay our transaction and we will continue to do that with the BDOs and some of the core payments to be able to rather continue building up. 
Brad Milsaps 
Okay. So that number will be in the Q at first.
John Francoeur
I am not sure.
Brad Milsaps 
Okay.
John Francoeur
We use to disclose that and that I believe the last couple quarters we haven’t. We’ll take a look at it and see. 
Brad Milsaps 
That’s fine. And then, just kind of more strategically, Mitch, you guys retain more one to four family residential this quarter. I know the commercial was more than you expected but it sounds like the pipeline is good. Can you talk about strategic process around retaining more of the one to four family and kind of how you might or may or may not do that in the future?
Mitchell Feiger
I’ll keep it off and anybody who are here can jump in and correct me. So my thinking on working mortgaging assets once we are keeping our high quality adjustable rate loans, and the returns on capital we think are pretty good for those assets and I think we are going to continue to put them on our balance sheet until we can’t frankly. 
So, larger strategic thought here been set, but it looks like we can grow loans as I mentioned in the mid to single – mid to high-single-digits, okay. In the first quarter, we grew loans about 6% annualized and that with adversely no commercial loan growth. Commercial loan growth returns, right, that number is going to probably go up. 
The challenge for us, it’s not just us, for anybody in our situation is growing high quality low cost deposits at that same rate and that’s a really, really hard thing to do. And so, I think that as loans continue to grow, they grow and we can’t grow high quality low cost deposits at the same pace. We are going to be faced with the decision about which loans to keep on our balance sheet. 
And I think that that’s a kind of a global thought and we’ve faced this before and if we face it again, we’ll go through the loan book and we’ll look for the loans that have the lowest return, returns on capital, risk-adjusted returns on capital, we’ll probably go after those and try and move them elsewhere. I am not sure, where resi mortgage is ranking this year. We haven’t gone through the exercise in depth. 
So, I don’t have the exact answer for you. I want to say one more thing about that, one thing, good thing about the resi mortgage hold is that, of course, it’s easy to turn off those are entirely saleable and our mortgage team would be happy to sell them and then actually the short run of it’s right more mortgage income. 
I think that’s correct. Now that’s kind of how we are thinking about it at the moment. I would say one more thing about deposits. And I am worried about it. I think loan growth is going to remain healthy. I think they will probably remain healthy in the industry, rising rates would put some, I just now – and just now beginning to put pressure on deposit pricing and liquidity and if rates continue to rise, I’ll worry about, I worry about the liquidity aspects and the industry’s ability to raise low cost deposits. 

So, we are – bear in top of mind for us we are doing what we can to improve our already great low cost deposit gathering businesses, and I very much like our position, I like our position, more than anybody else in that regard, but that’s what’s to be done there. I don’t know, anybody want to add? 
Randall Conte
That should covering… 
Mitchell Feiger
Sorry, long winded answer to a short question.
Brad Milsaps 
No, that’s great, Mitch. We appreciate. Thanks for all the new disclosure.
Operator 
And our next question comes from Nathan Race with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.
Nathan Race 
Hey guys. Good morning. 
Mitchell Feiger
Good morning, Nathan. 
Nathan Race 
Want to just start on the loan yield increase this quarter, Randy, if you kind of help us understand how much of that was a function of the production that you guys put on balance sheet this quarter versus the benefit that we had to see a December hike?
Randall Conte
So, you are talking mortgage then in terms of the production?
Nathan Race 
No, the core loan yield was up nine basis points linked quarters. So you kind of help us understand how much of that was a function of the production that you guys put on the balance sheet versus the benefits of the rate hike in December?
Randall Conte
No really, no, I don’t know, I don’t know that specifically. So, I’d be speculating that – on that question, Nathan.
Nathan Race 
I guess, just ask it in a different way, can we can expect a similar increase in the second quarter given that rate hike that we had in March?
Randall Conte
Well, let’s talk about – yes, I would think that we should see, if I try to say, but I stumble my words, slightly increasing our non-interest margin in this interest rate environment, right. So, that’s one. And then, let’s talk about what we do know, right, most of those loans just we get close on – the number of loans that are in the money inflows has reduced fairly dramatically where it sounded about $270 million less than the entire portfolio. 
So, - just we would say that any kind of rate hike is going to – to me anyway start to have more and more of an impact, right, and fall right to the bottom-line. And that’s an example. The other thing I would quote is that a substantial portion of the loans are variable rate in nature nearly, I think $8 billion of the loan portfolios is in variable rate either in LIBOR based loans, prime based loans, et cetera. 
And of that, substantial portion is LIBOR. So again as rates move, we expect to see similar increases. That number have stayed pretty consistent over the last few quarters and those are couple fund facts I think could help support the points. 
Nathan Race 
Now that’s very helpful. I appreciate that color. And then, the increase in wholesale funding cost this quarter, was that just a function of the rate hike in December, was there any other items that impacted that higher level of funding cost this quarter?
Randall Conte
No, nothing, that’s true. You got it. You’ve been able to. The one thing I would do, Nathan is, I am going to go back and I’ll let Mr. John or Mark or someone can resist me on this one, but when I do look kind of at a rate volume analysis and we do that analysis on our assets and then particular in loans, we saw a couple million dollars on the rate side. 
If you put the rate variances, so here it was loans, so it’s about a $2 million rate pick up, increase in interest income, let me be clear, associated with the rate change. And if that’s the question we are asking, that I have very specifically. And so, hopefully that’s a little bit more color for you. 
Nathan Race 
Just to be perfect, but you guys, we can’t talk about, if that was call it the ambition of new loans at higher rates, those would be increase in base rates. 
Randall Conte

That’s right. I don’t have disclosed, that’s exactly accurate. We do not have to split on that $2 million approximately between new loans generated and new loans originated versus the rate increase. So, but I can give a flavor for the amount of the – we can give flavor to the amount anyway. 
Nathan Race 
That’s perfect. Thanks and I appreciate the disclosures you released. 
Randall Conte
You are welcome.
Operator 
Our next question comes from Michael Young with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please go ahead.
Michael Young 
Hey, good morning everyone.
Mitchell Feiger
Good morning. 
Michael Young 
I want to start with, Randy, your comments on the two-thirds of the commercial customers have already moved over to the new online banking system and another, I guess, one-third coming in 2Q, but, maybe just a big picture question, how you expect that to actually impact the balance sheet or income statement going forward in terms of either stickier deposits going forward, or higher fees, lower expenses, et cetera?
Randall Conte
Well, let me say, I’ll take a piece of that and then I am going to refer over to Mr. Hoppe here, but he’ll he give you his view on this as well. But, first of all, I would say that our commercial online banking system has been sub-market, sub-standard and I think as it’s just an old version that hasn’t, there was time to the change. We needed to bring it current and then some and that’s what we did. 
And we then converted the entire system over and it’s a whole fresh look and it’s very intuitive as I pointed out. What this can do to the balance sheet is that, I think it’s going to enable our bankers to get out and get into the marketplace and feel comfortable that they’ve got a system that has the capable – their customers are going to have the capabilities at their finger tips to transact business the way they would like in an easy way and then efficiently go about doing their business. 
Now, I would tell you that I think, I would think the American Chartered Bankers in particular, the ex American Chartered Bankers were used to a different system. That was a greater step or two above what we had at – as legacy MB prior and that’s what we – and we converted away from that old system to a system that I think is and we think is better than what American Chartered Bankers were used to. 
So what that could do is, calm the nerves that actually have the online banking capabilities for our customers and let those bankers get back into the marketplace and go after do business and that will impact the balance sheet from loan growth and other aspects. But I’ll stop there and let Mark jump in see what he actually has about. 
Mark Hoppe
Not really a lot, but, no because Randy hit most of the major points. Just a little bit different angle on it. Our bankers have been so excited to have this new product and we’ve been researching this for years, approximately three or four years, this is such a critical, critical product and we want to make sure we had capabilities which were strong for our existing clients and then once we anticipate adding and so very solid that I’ve seen in my years in banking a relationship manager excited about a new product as this one. 
And it’s not only a new product but new system and a new processes and provides a lot of advantages for our clients and we’ll make things easier for them as it relates to dealing with us on a daily basis with our online banking. So, when you see clients or when you see – excited about something, I think it’s meaningful. 
I wouldn’t put a dollar and cents to it, what is this going to add, but it’s certainly going to add to our efficiency and it’s also going to add to our clients’ efficiencies, whenever you do something like that, it’s beneficial. 
Michael Young 

Okay, thanks. And, Mitch, maybe your comments on asset quality and how can’t get any better understand on this more of a big picture comment, but what are the specific areas that you are maybe most watchful of near term?
Mitchell Feiger
Well, I only have one concern that’s credit, and that is, the recent credit is good not just here, but I think across the industry because there are companies or people, lenders out there is that, make loans that we won’t and so, when we have a problem asset, it finds another home, probably a good home, so it finds another home very quickly. 
And so, I think, my sense is that here and across the company there continues to be challenges, it’s not that there is a downward migration in the quality, there is downward migration, but the exit doors wide open. And I think I said this in prior calls, what worries me is if that exit door closes, what happens. But other than that, there is nothing to look at, that I’d – do you have any concerns about the portfolio?
Randall Conte
No, that’s so to your comment that we’ve been successful using the competitive landscape to exit some of the more marginal credits. I think on a more global portfolio basis, we continue to look at loans that have multiple concessions than other things and it seems like some of the traditional things that used to be concessionary had now morphed into reasonable customary and standard and so, when the landscape keeps lowering the bar, more and more concessions, those loans are certainly on our radar screen, especially, if they ask for additional concessions and then, we revert back using the competitive landscape to exit some of those.
Michael Young 
Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator 
Our next question comes from Chris McGratty with KBW. Please go ahead. 
Chris McGratty 
Hey, good morning gentlemen. 
Randall Conte
Good morning, Chris.
Chris McGratty 
I mean, Mitch, I want to go back to the comments if we could on the balance sheet and the deposit concerns. I am interested in kind of big picture how you think this plays out not only for you, but for the industry. I guess, maybe starting with you, does this kind of conservatism on deposits necessitate a further indexing of the earning assets from securities, I kind of reduced the securities portfolio to fund the growth. 
And then secondarily, I guess, I am interested in any comments on how you think this plays out from an M&A perspective given the desire to grow deposits. Whether your role has changed or will change and what do you think competitors will change with you? Thanks.
Mitchell Feiger
I am going to take the second part first, and then I’ll hand it off to Randy to answer the question about balance sheet and investments and things like that. So, right, as funding gets tighter, deposit becomes here - and I would think that deposit rich franchises would become more in demand. If you look at the companies at MB has acquired over the years, numbers wise, most have been deposit rich franchises, right that we view as to fund commercial loan growth. 
On the last two American Chartered and our merger with Taylor are the different nature, but if you look at the six banks acquisitions we did in 2009 and 2010, those are obviously are 100% deposit focused because, by definition the loans are not low so much. And if you go back prior to that in 2006, go back a while, but those were banks – with deposit rich companies, low loan to deposit ratio. 
So, I think that maybe some people will also affected at that time – that kind of thinking in acquisitions. That said, if you look particularly around the Chicago marketplace, there aren’t a lot of banks. They have low loan to deposit ratios and great deposit base. It’s a limited number for sure. So I am not – I guess, what I am saying is, they increase the desire of people who buy deposit rich franchises and lenders will be available. Randy, do you want to hit the balance sheet question? 

Randall Conte
Sure, sure. So speaking specifically to the investments question, I mean, throughout – I am going to go back to 2016 and throughout 2016 we weren’t really selling an investments and nor have we actively pursued the sale of investments to fund the balance sheet as indicated up to this point through 2017 either. 
What we have seen is that portfolio , we didn’t really see any good investments to make and given where interest rates were and what our standards are and so we kind of stick – stuck to our discipline in 2016 and trying to generate the returns that we are comfortable with and used to some of the investment portfolios. 
So, we provide that portfolio repay as over the course of the – that 15 months if you will and only this time, only in this quarter, for the first time in a while have started to see our treasurer make some small purchases where we’ve seen investments that are meeting the standards and those of the products used to over the course of the last several years. 
So, now, to the bigger picture, obviously, they will be more strategic question of would we do that if necessary. I think it goes right after Mitch’s point and when we have to wait the exit side or the different categories of that on our page and see those returns are and how they are returning on capital and do that across the board and I wouldn’t exclude or I would include our investment portfolio in that evaluation. 
So that would be my reaction to it. At this point in time, we have not yet to do that. But as Mitch pointed out, I think it could be time to take a look at that in the near future. 
Chris McGratty 
That’s great. If I could just sneak in a couple follow-ups. Mitch, does this – is your desire to be primarily Chicago-based – does this change at all with you kind of broaden the footprint off if you saw something?
Mitchell Feiger
I think your – well, let’s pack up, I was Chicago based, yes. And our Coromandel market commercial banking business is - in Chicago, focusing Chicago for sure. But if you look at the loans on our balance sheet now, some – a little bit more than half of our loans are outside Illinois at this point. And if you think about it, if you got the big buckets outside that are national, right, our asset-based loans, around $900 million, I don’t know really exact numbers, but on the order of $900 million. 
But saw a very small percentage those are in Illinois. Our residential mortgage loans that are about $1 billion, now probably less than half are in Illinois. I don’t know the exact number. Of these loans which are approaching $2 billion our national, and so a low percentage of that is in Illinois and then we got our healthcare business that’s been expanding outside the Illinois and more. 
And the reason for that is that, economic growth frankly and certainly an ability to come to market with great products that caused us to go outside the states. So, that’s straight forward. Secondly, regarding deposits and I think that’s where you are going. I think it’s really hard to acquire a franchise in another market where we would be unknown and being successful at it. 
I would roll it out entirely. I think we are very open minded company about lots of things and it’s possible, but I think that’s got a much higher hurdle across to do it. We have to view the – an extraordinary opportunity and one that we felt need to be successful in the market even without any other brand recognition and by the way, an ability to help ourselves with people and staff in markets, who know the markets. 
Let me sort of stepping around and there have been a lot of companies that have come to the Chicago marketplace from outside states. And almost entirely they have been unsuccessful over the years and I think the reason is, this is a highly competitive market. 

I think going back many years, some people can’t really understand the market and they were in a situation where they were unable to help themselves because their teams and the knowledge base was elsewhere. And we just don’t want to put ourselves in that position. So, it’s not entirely impossible, but I think unlikely and hard to do.
Chris McGratty 
Okay, that’s awesome color. Just one quick one and I spend this to talk about all the investments you are making and the synergies and the deals, is there a specific rate of growth that you guys might be targeting? Or is it a function of just managing the expense growth rate to ensure positive operating leverage? Thanks. 
Randall Conte
Sure, so, hey, this is Randy. From an expense growth perspective, I mean, that it stayed consistent with what we commented on last quarter. We’ve got and what that was frankly was low single-digit type numbers of an increase. Right, so, and I think with the success we had in the first quarter we are continuing to focus on kind of the balance that Mitch pointed out, right. 
Those opportunities to save and reduce our core expenses, but we also want to invest very thoughtfully and strategically and that balance is really going to be – let’s keep at – and starting to make sure we are doing the right thing. 
But I do think that’s an opportunity to keep offsetting some of our investments with additional cost saves as we go throughout this year and the $155 million worth of non-interest expense for the core $154 million if you take out the – the kind of one-timers, I think we are going to see just a single-digit - small single-digit type – certainly less than 3% or 4% or less over the last many years.
Chris McGratty 
Thanks a lot.
Randall Conte
Sure.
Operator 
[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Brian Martin with FIG Partners. Please go ahead.
Brian Martin 
Good morning. 
Mitchell Feiger
Good morning, Brian.
Randall Conte
Good morning, Brian.
Brian Martin 
So, maybe just a couple housekeeping things. Randy, the capital markets’ revenue was off a little bit this quarter I guess, and I think maybe since you talked about – some of you talked about maybe swaps being a little bit lower, but just, if you can guess more of an anomaly I guess, what – anything to think about going forward in that number?
Mark Hoppe
Brian, it’s Mark Hoppe. I’ll take that one. Yes, we do think it’s an anomaly. Actually, rates did bump up a little bit and looks like they were trending up and that probably had an impact on some of our clients’ views going forward. But, no, we feel very good about that group and the opportunities that we have with existing clients - with new clients and so, we think that’s what – I don’t think we are ever going to say, we are going to have a straight-line growth in that type of fee income category. We think that, the dip in the first quarter is good of an anomaly. No, I wouldn’t worry about it. 
Randall Conte
Yes, this is Randy. I wouldn’t worry about it, Brian and I also would go back and just look at the five quarter trend on that line, it’s fairly nice in terms of the growth that we’ve seen in over the last couple of years and it’s – the swap side of the equation is only few hundred thousand dollars, half a million. 
Brian Martin 
Yes, okay. Okay, good, thanks and then, just the other couple things. Randy, jut the comments you had about the accretion and I don’t recall the previous, I guess, guidance with the stock ops this was on the accretion, but just in general, the commentary on the accretion is just a – there is nothing more significant decline expected over the next couple of quarters. Is that fair or consistent with what you said before?
Randall Conte
Yes, again, I think of these members like – but, it’s somewhat we are in the $7 million, $7.1 million worth of accretion in the quarter as we get down about $700,000 or $800,000 from the prior quarter and $7 million feels like a good number for me. But, maybe an opportunity to retreat some of these – what our philosophy is about loan provisioning versus accretion. 

So, this has a net impact. That’s important here too, right. Sure, we’ll go to John as he – so as we go through the income on the discount and we also – as loans renew, we take that accretion and write away on those as well. So, those can bounce around a little bit. 
But on top of that, if you take the provisioning on top of that, we view a lot of the discount as credit-related. So we are providing, I think as we mentioned before, on a lot of that accretion. So the net impact to the bottom-line is not that base, because we are providing as we go on this. 
Brian Martin 
Right, okay. Well, if I ask on that one. All right, and then just an housekeeping. Just the loan growth in the quarter, I mean, it sounds as though, from Mitch’s comments that the – he is optimistic on the commercial loan – I guess, the slowdown in this quarter, I guess, would you attribute it more to, kind of what you alluded to last quarter that the American Chartered Bank has still maybe a little bit out of the market or would you say, some of it was a softness or seasonality in the market that was kind of impacting it?
Mark Hoppe
Brian, it’s Mark. We’ve done a pretty careful analysis of this and we’ve come a way that we are pretty convinced that just seasonal in nature there, in a portfolio this large, there is just a lot of different things that happen. We talk a lot about diversification and how diversified our customer base is and that’s really from a seasonal perspective that’s what it feels to us as we did our analysis on this front when the numbers came in at the 3/31 numbers came in.
Brian Martin 
Okay. All right, fair enough. And just a last two things. The – Mitch, I guess, you talked about the loan growth kind of the less assets, just the deposit growth more importantly is maybe a bit more challenging and I guess, what do you see as kind of a sustainable growth rate in deposits for the deposit mix that you guys aspire to continue to hold going forward? 
I mean, is it similar to what you were suggesting on the loan side, is that kind of mid to upper-single-digit type of deposit growth in the buckets if you will if you guys want to grow. Is that how you are thinking about things in much realistic given the market conditions today?
Mitchell Feiger
So, two thoughts, certainly, deposit growth can be had, if you are willing to pay the right products, right. If you do too much of that it crushes margins and so we are not excited about doing that. That’s thought one. Getting high quality, low cost or stable deposit growth, especially in Chicago, our deposit taking branches are, to get that at the mid to high-single-digits it’s really hard. 
We are going to work toward that and I’d like to get there, but I can’t say that we are going to get there at the moment. I assure we would like to, we are going to shift some resources I think that encourage that, but we’ve got work to do. 
Brian Martin 
Okay. All right. Just the last one would be, maybe one for Randy, just on the benefits to rate increases, I guess, if you get a little bit of lens off the current kind of core margin rates, I guess, if you look over the next four or six quarters with rates likely going higher, I mean, what are you guys’ view kind of a longer-term sustainable type of margins to the commercialization you guys have and then I guess, as a longer term level of stabilizes once you factor in a little bit more benefit like you are saying to come from the bottom-line, you’ve got more variable rate assets.
Randall Conte
Yes, so, this is Randy. I’ll take to answer that, but in the current environment, I do see our margins, right, net interest margins increasing slightly as you continue to see the increases in interest rates, right. And so, in terms of the target for that, no it’s something that, I haven’t – my figures say it’s not something I really want all you to lock into. There is some other things that can impact. 

So – but, I do – we do see it going up and I think with the increases that are similar to what we have experienced, if we see another one or two of those or three of those over the course of the consuming year, we expect our balance sheet at this point to react similarly. And when we do our – one of the things that someone that commented on – I think last call, or maybe in Investor Day was, they were surprised that our – the change in our interest rates from an increase in rates wasn’t larger. 
Well, I think one was – I’ve been quoting to ramp, type increases and some folks quote shocks and so, from a ramp perspective, our increase stays in that – we project around $24 million increase for a 1% increase in rates and versus shock our balance sheet, simultaneous shock that’s doubled at least. And so, that’s about – that’s the color I would provide to the question that you asked. But I don’t know if anybody else in the room wants to jump in on there. So picks silence, there is no. 
Brian Martin 
Okay. All right. Thanks guys. I appreciate taking the questions.

Who's Chicago's highest-paid biz bank chief?


MB Financial CEO Mitchell Feiger has reclaimed the mantle of highest-paid locally based commercial bank chief.Feiger's 2014 compensation totaled $3.6 million, up 24 percent from $2.9 million in 2013. The increase was due largely to MB Financial's completion last year of its $680 million acquisition of the parent of Cole Taylor Bank. Feiger outpaced Edward Wehmer, CEO of Wintrust Financial, and Larry Richman, CEO of PrivateBancorp, both of whom got 2014 pay packages valued at $3.1 million.Richman had been the most richly compensated local bank CEO in 2013, overtaking Feiger, who was highest-paid in 2012.All three banks, the biggest locally based business lenders, issued proxy statements on April 10 detailing executive compensation.MB Financial's takeover of Cole Taylor parent Taylor Capital Group strengthened Chicago-based MB's commercial banking operation. But as of Dec. 31, MB Financial remained smaller than both PrivateBancorp and Wintrust, with $14.6 billion in assets versus $15.6 billion and $20 billion, respectively, for the other two.WHAT DO INVESTORS THINK OF THE DEAL?So far, investors are at best taking a jury-is-out point of view on the Cole Taylor transaction. MB Financial's stock rose 2.5 percent last year, trailing the 5.3 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 600 Financial Index. Year to date through yesterday's close, MB Financial's stock price dropped nearly 6 percent compared with essentially flat performance for the index.Wintrust's stock price rose 1.4 percent last year and has increased another 3.6 percent so far this year. PrivateBancorp is by far the big winner among local bank stocks, posting increases of 15.5 percent last year and 9.6 percent so far this year.In 2014, MB Financial paid Feiger $788,500 in salary and $1.1 million in cash incentive pay. The incentive pay was nearly double the $581,250 he got in 2013. Stock awards included $1.25 million in restricted stock and a little over $124,000 in options. Other compensation totaled slightly over $342,000.In the proxy, MB Financial's compensation committee cited Feiger's leadership. The committee noted his “contributions to the execution of our business plan” and his crucial role in “successfully melding the senior leadership teams and business units of (MB Financial) and Taylor Capital.”At PrivateBancorp, whose stock price has risen due to the bank's ability to generate double-digit loan growth, Richman's cash haul was $1.95 million ($970,833 in salary and $978,961 in incentive pay). He got a little over $729,000 in stock awards and another $292,308 in options. Other compensation totaled a little over $135,000.Wehmer's salary of $1.1 million was tops among the three. His cash bonus of $976,000 was 13 percent higher than 2013's $860,000. Stock and option awards both came in at $357,500. Other compensation totaled nearly $38,000.WINTRUST GROWSWehmer has expanded Wintrust to $20 billion in assets, largely through a rapid-fire series of deals for small banks in the Chicago area and southern Wisconsin.PrivateBancorp was the only one of the three to generate double-digit returns. Its return on common equity in 2014 was 10.9 percent compared with 7.8 percent for Wintrust and 5.3 percent for MB Financial.The fourth locally based mid-sized commercial bank, Itasca-based First Midwest Bancorp, paid CEO Michael Scudder $2.7 million in 2014, according to its proxy statement, issued today. Scudder got $750,000 in salary; $482,400 in cash incentive pay; $47,000 in cash bonus; $1.1 million in stock awards; more than $221,000 in increased pension value; and more than $111,000 in other compensation.First Midwest's return on average common equity was 6.6 percent last year. Its stock price fell 2.4 percent in 2014 and has gained 2.3 percent so far this year through yesterday's close.
