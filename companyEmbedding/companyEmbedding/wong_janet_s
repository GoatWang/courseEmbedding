Just TRY.
That’s the message I share with children, teachers, librarians, and aspiring authors all over the world.
Do you have an idea? Write it down. Don’t worry about making it “good”—just TRY.
The key is getting started. Getting those big wheels in your brain to move.
If you sputter, if you stall, no problem. Wait a little while and start it up again.
Someone needs to write the poems of the 21st century.
Someone needs to write our stories, our books, our movies, our slogans, our songs.

Why not YOU?

Pomelo Books
Pomelo? Think “big grapefruit.” Pomelo Books? Think “BIG poetry books!”
The Poetry Friday Anthology series weighs as much as three pomelos—and packs enough poems for a first-rate Poetry Friday celebration! Each edition, K-5 and Middle School (6-8), contains more than 280 pages of original poems and “Take 5!” teaching tips for each poem that are tied to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS), the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), or the Texas TEKS. These books are, pound-for-pound, the best poetry deals around.
But what makes a pomelo most special isn’t its size or its sweetness. In Cantonese the word for pomelo (bo-look) sounds like the words for Prosperity and Status. In English, the word pomelo sounds sort of like, well, a poem. Chinese people think that a pomelo brings continuous prosperity and status into the home. Sylvia and I would like to think that Pomelo Books will bring “continuous in-print status” to a whole bunch of poems that will become tomorrow’s classics. And enough prosperity to allow us to produce 1 or 2 quality poetry books each year, books that will pucker your lips, reduce cholesterol, cure scurvy, curb global warming, and make young people happy while teaching them lots.
About our “Take 5!” Mini-Lesson approach to poetry: we believe in “Poetry Plus”—poetry PLUS quick-and-easy sharing, poetry PLUS the Common Core, poetry PLUS the TEKS, poetry PLUS science, and poetry PLUS lots more fun!
Please stop by and spend some time looking around at the free Pocket Poems™ Cards, Poem Movies, and more. Bookmark PomeloBooks.com to celebrate poetry on Friday—and any day!

You Have to Write
By Janet S. Wong
Illustrated by: Teresa Flavin
For Ages: 8 - 12


1award













































You have to write! It's a class assignment. But you have nothing to write about. All the other kids seem to have something to tell because they start in right away. What can you do? Stop and think. No one else can tell your stories -- about your family, your dog or cat. No one else can tell how it was when your library book got soaked in the rain.  But what if you don't like what you write? There are all sorts of ways to change it, to make it better. Keep on playing with your words, putting them together in different ways. You want whatever you write to be good. It will get better and better as you work on it.  This is an encouraging book, sympathetically illustrated by Teresa Flavin's charming pictures, for all young readers who worry when they're told to write something.

Janet S. Wong













                    
                    Janet S. Wong (www.janetwong.com) is an award-winning author and anthologist of more than two dozen books for young readers, teachers, and parents. One of the most distinctive things about Janet Wong's body of work is its variety. There's at least one book for anyone--and EVERYONE! Picture BooksBUZZ This book was an L.A. Times Best Book of the Year for children--a lively read-aloud about a toddler's busy morning routine. Kids love buzzing along every time you point to the word BUZZ!THE DUMPSTER DIVERThis book is not just for kids--with its hipster illustrations, it's a quirky gift for anyone who is good at "creative recycling." Give it to a 5-year-old future engineer along with a box full of assorted junk or to your dad for helping you clean your garage.APPLE PIE 4th of JULYThis book landed Janet a gig at the White House Easter Egg Roll--a "slice of community" story celebrating diversity. HOMEGROWN HOUSEGorgeous illustrations by E.B. Lewis enhance this story about making a house feel like a home.Poetry BooksTWIST: Yoga Poems This book is for all ages, from 3-year-olds who love looking at Julie Paschkis's detailed illustrations (and can bend themselves into all of the yoga poses) to 73-year-old yoga teachers. In "Finding the Center," the author compares herself to a doughnut.KNOCK ON WOOD: Poems about SuperstitionsTeachers looking for books to use with the Common Core will enjoy discussing the Author's Notes about what the superstitions mean and comparing them with the way superstitions are presented in poems. A follow-up exercise is to have students interview family members about those same superstitions.GOOD LUCK GOLD and A SUITCASE OF SEAWEED Janet Wong received the Claremont Stone Center Recognition of Merit for these two classic collections about the Asian American experience. BEHIND THE WHEEL: Poems about DrivingForty poems for teens about driving also use driving as a metaphor for a wide variety of life issues.THE RAINBOW HAND: Poems about Mothers and ChildrenChildren's favorites from this book include "Smother Love" and "Crazy Mother," while new mothers appreciate poems reflecting on the motherhood experience such as "The Gift of Breathing Slow."ONCE UPON A TIGER: New Beginnings for Endangered AnimalsAs with KNOCK ON WOOD, this is another title that teachers will find useful in their teaching of the Common Core. Most of these poems about endangered animals are "pourquoi tale" poems with a folkloric feel, and yet critical readers will be able to recognize embedded facts once they read the nonfiction notes.DECLARATION OF INTERDEPENDENCE: Poems for an Election YearThese mostly-lighthearted and nonpartisan poems about various aspects of an election--from debates to the electoral college to broader issues such as liberty--will spark discussion in classrooms and at home. TheDeclarationOfInterdependenceBlog.blogspot.com.Chapter BooksME AND ROLLY MALOOThe pressures of standardized testing in 4th grade push Rolly Maloo to ask Jenna to cheat; but only Jenna is caught. Should she keep her secret, or tell on Rolly Maloo? This hybrid graphic novel will be useful in starting discussions about cheating (why we do it, how to say no, and how to deal with being caught in a lie). A Horace Mann Upstanders Award Honor Book (recognizing books where a character stands up for something important).MINN AND JAKEThis "easy reader for 5th graders" focuses on the unlikely friendship between a lizard-loving girl and a tech geek. A Washington Sasquatch finalist and BCCB Blue Ribbon Award winner.MINN AND JAKE'S ALMOST TERRIBLE SUMMERIn this sequel to the popular MINN AND JAKE, Jake visits his old home in Los Angeles and learns "you can't go back home again"--but a string of hilarious mini-disasters involving self-tanning lotion, ants, buffet meals, and Disneyland can teach you to appreciate your new friends more than ever!Books that Teachers Like:YOU HAVE TO WRITEA picture book about the writing and revision process--cited on Common Core lists as useful.BEFORE IT WRIGGLES AWAYA "Meet the Author" book that gives insight into the writing process with a "just do it" message to put ideas down on paper "before they wriggle away."THE POETRY FRIDAY ANTHOLOGYA K-5 anthology of 218 poems by 76 poets, with curriculum connections for each poem. Edited by Janet Wong and children's literature professor Sylvia Vardell. (This is available in a Common Core version and in a Texas TEKS version.)THE POETRY TAG TIME E-BOOK SERIES (PoetryTagTime, P*TAG, and GIFT TAG)The three e-books in this series are also Vardell and Wong ventures; accessible poems at irresistible e-book prices; and easy to project onto a Smartboard or screen so that the whole classroom can read and discuss these poems at the same time.About Janet Wong: When Janet Wong is not writing, speaking at teacher conferences, or sharing writing tips with children in schools, she spends most of her time trying to grow blueberries and carnivorous plants at her home in Princeton, NJ.
