Dear Fellow Wintergreen Fund Shareholder,
EXCERPT FROM THE 2016 ANNUAL REPORT SHAREHOLDER LETTER
Posted March 1, 2017
Looking back on Wintergreen Fund, Inc.'s (the "Fund") 2016 results, two related themes stick out in bold relief. First, there's simply no sure thing in this world - no sure winner, no sure loser, no sure outcome. Because of that, investors need to be prepared for the unexpected, owning undervalued companies that can survive, if not thrive, in a broad range of market conditions. Second, every vote matters, whether shareholder or citizen. With that in mind, we at Wintergreen Advisers look for companies that respect and live by good governance. If we are invested and don't see that, there's a good chance we will ask management to change or we will ask shareholders to join us in bringing about that change. Quite literally, we are active managers. The vote matters.
The Fund had strong 2016 returns from long-term portfolio holdings Reynolds American Inc. ("Reynolds"), Birchcliff Energy Ltd., and Altria Group Inc. Securities that underperformed included Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., which the Fund sold during the year, Swatch Group AG, and Provident Financial plc. The Fund also employed forward currency contracts, which had an overall positive impact on performance during the year.
If you would be a real seeker after truth,it is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as possible, all things.
- René Descartes
Let's look at some highlights for the Fund. In last year's annual letter, we noted many virtues of Reynolds as a core portfolio investment for many years. A smart management team combined Reynolds with Lorillard, Inc. in an earnings-accretive deal, creating an even more powerful cash generating business. In the process, the company increased its appeal to British American Tobacco plc ("BAT"), its largest owner with 42% of outstanding shares, as a must-own asset to fully capture opportunities in the U.S. and benefit from Reynolds's product innovations. Our belief that BAT would eventually bid for the rest of the shares came to fruition last October, resulting in a surge in the value of Reynolds, the Fund's largest holding. With an improved deal price and structure more favorable to shareholders, Reynolds agreed to the takeover in January of 2017 (closing is expected by the Adviser to occur in the third quarter of 2017). As shareholders of BAT, another top holding of the Fund, we hope to continue to collect the steady amounts of cash returned by this combined powerhouse.

David J. Winters, CFA
Portfolio Manager
The views contained in this report are those of the Fund's portfolio manager as of December 31, 2016, and may not reflect his views on the date this report is first published or anytime thereafter. The preceding examples of specific investments are included to illustrate the Fund's investment process and strategy. There can be no assurance that such investments will remain represented in the Fund's portfolios. Holdings and allocations are subject to risks and to change. The views described herein do not constitute investment advice, are not a guarantee of future performance, and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any security.

The Fund is subject to several risks, any of which could cause an investor to lose money. The Fund may purchase risk arbitrage securities (securities of companies involved in a restructuring) or distressed companies. These companies may not be successful in their restructuring and securities of distressed companies are generally more likely to become worthless than securities of more financially stable companies. Smaller companies involve substantial risk as these securities are traditionally more volatile in price than larger company securities. Value risk is that the securities in which the Fund invests may never reach what the Investment Manager believes are their full market values. Securities rated below investment grade, sometimes called junk bonds, involve a greater degree of risk than investment grade bonds in return for higher yield potential. The Fund may be subject to interest rate risk which is the risk that debt securities in the Fund's portfolio will decline in value because of increases in market interest rates. By participating in derivative securities, the Fund may attempt to hedge (protect) against currency risk which is the risk that the value of foreign securities may be affected by changes in currency exchange rates. Derivatives can be volatile and involve various types and degrees of risks, depending upon the characteristics of a particular derivative. International investing involves certain risks and increased volatility not associated with investing solely in the U.S. These risks include currency fluctuations, economic or financial instability, lack of timely or reliable financial information or unfavorable political or legal developments. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. As a result of appreciation of certain of the Fund's portfolio securities and/or a change in the size of the Fund, investments in a particular sector or industry may represent a significant portion of the Fund's overall portfolio.  If this occurs, the Fund will be subject to greater potential risk than funds that do not have as much exposure to such sector or industry. Short sale risk is the risk that the Fund will incur an unlimited loss if the price of a security sold short increases between the time of the short sale and the time the Fund replaces the borrowed security.
In light of these risks, the Fund may not be suitable for all investors.
Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and additional information regarding the Fund. To obtain a prospectus or summary prospectus, please download from this site or call toll-free 1-888-468-6473. The prospectus and summary prospectus should be read carefully before investing. This website is not a solicitation for the Fund outside of the United States.

Wintergreen Fund, Inc. Releases Annual Report to Shareholders
BY Business Wire— 9:56 AM ET 03/03/2017


 MOUNTAIN LAKES, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Wintergreen Fund, Inc. has released its 2016 Annual Report. The
      shareholder letter appears below and is also available at http://www.wintergreenfund.com.
    

      Dear Fellow Wintergreen Fund Shareholder,
    

      Looking back on Wintergreen Fund (WGRNX), Inc.’s 2016 results, two related themes stick out in bold relief.
      First, there’s simply no sure thing in this world — no sure winner, no
      sure loser, no sure outcome. Because of that, investors need to be
      prepared for the unexpected, owning undervalued companies that can
      survive, if not thrive, in a broad range of market conditions. Second,
      every vote matters, whether shareholder or citizen. With that in mind,
      we at Wintergreen Advisers look for companies that respect and live by
      good governance. If we are invested and don’t see that, there’s a good
      chance we will ask management to change or we will ask shareholders to
      join us in bringing about that change. Quite literally, we are active
      managers. The vote matters.
    

      The Fund had strong 2016 returns from long-term portfolio holdings
      Reynolds American Inc. (RAI) , Birchcliff Energy Ltd.
      (TMX: BIR), and Altria Group Inc. (MO) . Securities that
      underperformed included Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., which the Fund
      sold during the year, Swatch Group AG, and Provident Financial plc. The
      Fund also employed forward currency contracts, which had an overall
      positive impact on performance during the year.
    

If you would be a real seeker after truth,it
      is necessary that at least once in your life you doubt, as far as
      possible, all things.- René Descartes


      Let’s look at some highlights for the Fund. In last year’s annual
      letter, we noted many virtues of Reynolds as a core portfolio investment
      for many years. A smart management team combined Reynolds with
      Lorillard, Inc. in an earnings-accretive deal, creating an even more
      powerful cash generating business. In the process, the company increased
      its appeal to British American Tobacco plc (BTI) , its
      largest owner with 42% of outstanding shares, as a must-own asset to
      fully capture opportunities in the U.S. and benefit from Reynolds’s
      product innovations. Our belief that BAT would eventually bid for the
      rest of the shares came to fruition last October, resulting in a surge
      in the value of Reynolds, the Fund’s largest holding. With an improved
      deal price and structure more favorable to shareholders, Reynolds agreed
      to the takeover in January of 2017 (closing is expected by the Adviser
      to occur in the third quarter of 2017). As shareholders of BAT, another
      top holding of the Fund, we hope to continue to collect the steady
      amounts of cash returned by this combined powerhouse.
    

      Like the tobacco industry, the oil and gas industry is also undergoing
      consolidation, and the Fund has benefited from its holding in Baker
      Hughes, Inc. (BHI) . The Fund’s position in BHI was
      initiated in late 2015 as an arbitrage opportunity when Halliburton
      Company (“HAL”) bid for BHI, and as a proxy for an anticipated return to
      growth in the oil services industry. Because the outcome of the merger
      was uncertain, the deal was written with a breakup fee of $3.5 billion,
      which we viewed as an attractive safety cushion for BHI in the event
      that the merger agreement was terminated. The deal did indeed break
      around mid-2016, and HAL paid the breakup fee to BHI, which then
      commenced a massive buyback of its stock. Shortly thereafter, General
      Electric Co. made an approach to merge its own oil and gas business unit
      with BHI. The Board of BHI approved the transaction and the merger is
      scheduled to close in the middle of 2017. We highlight this arbitrage
      win for the Fund as an example of an investment strategy that we
      sometimes employ as a supplement to our core value investing style.
    

… We must think and act not only for the moment, but for our time.-
      Marshal Hubert Lyautey quoted by John F. Kennedy


      French Marshal Lyautey was a World War One European leader who was
      driven by his own complex moral code as he searched for intelligent
      solutions to what were the unprecedented problems of the day. He was a
      thoughtful man who inspired many, including John F. Kennedy, and
      recognized the vital need to plan for both short and long term
      international solutions. Elbit Systems Ltd. (TLV: ESLT, “Elbit”) of
      Israel may seem an unusual pick for the Fund’s portfolio, but it’s
      exactly the kind of business we look for: a global company addressing
      global needs with sustained, expanding demand. Elbit provides a wide
      range of defense, homeland security, and commercial programs that —
      regrettably — have become a foundation of modern life. Elbit’s
      operations cover the range of defense systems from aircraft to drones
      and unmanned surface vessels, to computer and intelligence systems, to
      electronic warfare and signal intelligence systems. The nature of
      military conflict has changed, with isolated, dispersed, and
      in-the-shadows incidents more common than a conventional war fought in
      the open. Today, countries need to be prepared for a series of both low
      intensity conflicts and ongoing terrorist activities. This requires a
      portfolio of responses that Elbit delivers and hones, an existential
      result of being constantly surrounded by hostile activity due to its
      location. Governments with either pressured defense budgets or
      relatively smaller budgets to begin with are increasingly turning to
      this nimble defense contractor. Whereas some prime contractors in the
      U.S. and Europe have experienced flat top-line growth in recent years,
      Elbit has managed a 2.7% compound annual growth rate in sales over the
      last five years, mainly through increased orders from governments in
      Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Although operating margins are currently
      lower than those of U.S. prime contractors, we believe it is only a
      matter of time before the gap is narrowed, adding increased profits to
      Elbit’s bottom line. Elbit may be the most potent defense company you
      have never heard of, but we are pleased to share this investment
      opportunity with you.
    

In a gentle way, you can shake the world.-
      Mahatma Ghandi


      Most investors are familiar with Heineken Holding NV (AMS: HEIO,
      “Heineken”), in particular because of its dark green premium beer
      bottle. Second only to Corona in U.S. imported beer, Heineken is sold
      virtually everywhere in the world. Growing from a single brewery in
      Amsterdam in 1864 to the second-largest beer company in the world today,
      Heineken brews more than 250 brands, with widespread name recognition of
      Amstel, Dos Equis, Sol and Tiger, in addition to its premium flagship
      brand. The company is focused on continued growth in emerging markets.
      Five years ago only about 20% of its profits came from developing
      markets. That percentage now exceeds 60%. The company has been able to
      combine sales growth with stable and improving margins, forming one of
      the pillars of our investment thesis in the company. Heineken’s
      management also keeps a sharp eye on efficient capital deployment,
      adhering to hard RONA (Return on Net Assets) metrics. In combination
      with well- defined executive compensation plan determinants, this
      properly ties management pay to performance. Make no mistake, the global
      beer business is extremely competitive, but we believe Heineken
      management is out in front seeking major growth opportunities. At the
      time of this writing, the company is working on a transaction intended
      to increase its business in India and has just finalized a deal in
      Brazil.
    

      We live in uncertain times. Because of that, we believe it useful to
      reiterate the foundation of the Fund’s investment principles.
      Specifically, when investing the Fund’s assets we look for:
    


        A business that has good or improving economics, one that often
        generates sales and profits in multiple markets and currencies;
      

        A management team working to benefit all long-term shareholders, not
        just for its own short-term compensation; and
      

        A security at a compelling price.
      


We keep moving forward, opening up new doors and doing new things…and
      curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.- Walt
      Disney


      Despite the uncertainties at home and abroad, we believe the future is
      bright for the Fund’s portfolio companies, and our process stands to
      uncover new investment opportunities. We believe our investment approach
      helps to limit downside risk through careful analysis and has the
      potential for substantial upside over time. In our opinion, investors
      who are careful with their money, invest for the long-term, and don’t
      borrow or invest on margin greatly increase their chances of success. By
      being sensible in their investment approach, an investor stacks the deck
      for their long-term opportunity.
    

      Thank you for your continued investment in Wintergreen Fund (WGRNX).
    

      Sincerely,
    

David J. Winters, CFAPortfolio Manager
    

IMPORTANT INFORMATION


Before investing you should carefully consider the Fund’s investment
      objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other information is
      in the prospectus and summary prospectus, a copy of which may be
      obtained by visiting the Fund’s website at www.wintergreenfund.com.
      Please read the prospectus and summary prospectus carefully before you
      invest.


The Fund is subject to several risks, any of which could cause an
      investor to lose money. Please review the prospectus for a more complete
      discussion of the Fund’s risks which include, but are not limited to,

      risks include currency fluctuations, economic or financial instability,
      lack of timely or reliable financial information or unfavorable
      political or legal developments. These risks are magnified in emerging

      unlimited loss if the price of a security sold short increases between

      described herein do not constitute investment advice, are not a
      guarantee of future performance, and are not intended as an offer or

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.
