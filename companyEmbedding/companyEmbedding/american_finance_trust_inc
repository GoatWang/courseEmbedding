Exhibit 99.1 


SHARE REPURCHASE PLAN
 
American Finance Trust, Inc.
EFFECTIVE AS OF OCTOBER 12, 2015

 

American Finance Trust, Inc., a
Maryland corporation (the “ Company ”), has
adopted this Share Repurchase Plan (the “ SRP
”), to be administered by the Company on the terms and
conditions set forth below.

 




1.


Participation in the SRP .



 




a.


Only those
stockholders who have purchased shares of common stock of the
Company, par value $0.01 per share (the “ Shares
”) from the Company or received their Shares from the Company
(directly or indirectly) through one or more non-cash transactions
may participate in the SRP. Under the SRP, stockholders may request
on any business day that the Company repurchase all or any portion,
subject to certain minimum conditions described in Section 1.c.
below, of Shares, if such repurchase does not impair the
Company’s capital or operations.



 




b.


A stockholder
who wishes to have Shares repurchased must mail or deliver to the
Company a written request on a form provided by the Company and
executed by the stockholder, its trustee or authorized agent. An
estate, heir or beneficiary that wishes to have Shares repurchased
following the death of a stockholder must mail or deliver to the
Company a written request on a form provided by the Company,
including evidence acceptable to the Company of the death of the
stockholder, and executed by the executor or executrix of the
estate, the heir or beneficiary, or their trustee or authorized
agent. Shares not repurchased may be passed to an estate, heir or
beneficiary following the death of a stockholder. If the Shares are
to be repurchased under any conditions outlined herein, the Company
will forward the documents necessary to effect the repurchase,
including any signature guaranty the Company may
require.



 




c.


In general, a
stockholder or his or her estate, heir or beneficiary may present
to the Company fewer than all of the Shares then-owned for
repurchase, except that the minimum number of Shares that must be
presented for repurchase shall be at least 25% of the
holder’s Shares. However, if the repurchase request is made
within six months of the event giving rise to the special
circumstances described in this sentence, where repurchase is being
requested (i) on behalf of the estate, heirs or beneficiaries, as
applicable, of a deceased stockholder; (ii) by a stockholder due to
another involuntary exigent circumstance, such as bankruptcy; or
(iii) by a stockholder due to a mandatory distribution under such
stockholder’s IRA, a minimum of 10% of the
stockholder’s Shares may be presented for repurchase; 
provided, however , that any future repurchase request by
such stockholder must present for repurchase at least 25% of such
stockholder’s remaining Shares.



 




d.


The Company
will pay repurchase proceeds, less any applicable tax or other
withholding required by law, by the 31 st day following
the end of the quarter during which the repurchase request was
made, subject to Section 2.b.



 




2.


Repurchase
Price for Shares under the SRP.



 




a.


The Company
will repurchase Shares pursuant to the SRP initially at $24.17 per
Share, which is equal to the estimated net asset value per share of
the Company’s common stock (the “ Estimated
Per-Share NAV ”) as of March 31, 2015, calculated by the
Company’s advisor, American Finance Advisors, LLC (the
“ Advisor ”), in accordance with the
Company’s valuation guidelines and approved by the
Company’s board of directors (the “ Board
”) on May 14, 2015. Beginning on the date on which the
Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
“ SEC ”) its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, and on each subsequent date on which
the Company files its Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company will
publish an Estimated Per-Share NAV for such year (each such date,
an “ NAV Pricing Date”) . The Company may
publish an Estimated Per-Share NAV more frequently than on an
annual basis if the independent directors of the Board, in their
sole discretion, determine that doing so is appropriate. For each
period beginning on an NAV Pricing Date and ending on the last
business day prio

NEW YORK, Sept. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- American Finance Trust, Inc. ("AFIN") announced today that the special committee of the board of directors unanimously approved the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of American Realty Capital – Retail Centers of America, Inc. ("RCA") for approximately $1.4 billion, payable in a combination of AFIN common shares and cash plus the assumption of certain debt. This transaction creates a premier diversified REIT with a retail focus, with an enterprise value of approximately $3.9 billion1. The transaction enhances AFIN's scale by combining two highly complementary U.S. real estate portfolios comprised of 494 properties aggregating 20.8 million rentable square feet, while improving the Company's capital structure and creating accretion to AFIN's funds from operations per share in 2017. 


The special committee of AFIN's board of directors, which consists of the independent members of the board of directors, was formed to evaluate the proposed transaction and has approved the transaction, subject to the approval of AFIN's shareholders and the shareholders of RCA. 
Michael Weil, Chief Executive Officer of AFIN, commented, "We are pleased to announce today's transaction which will bring together two high quality real estate portfolios and will create a best-in-class diversified REIT with a retail focus. The combination of AFIN and RCA will help the Company achieve critical scale, afford improved access to capital markets, result in significant cost savings for shareholders, and increase coverage of our distributions. For AFIN, today's announcement is a key step forward in our plan to grow earnings."
David M. Gong, Lead Independent Director of AFIN, explained, "The board of directors of AFIN formed the special committee, which consists of the independent members of the board, to evaluate potential strategic transactions.  It further empowered the special committee to negotiate terms of any transaction which the committee determined to pursue.  The special committee believes that the combination of the two companies will significantly enhance shareholder value."
Strategic and Financial Benefits of the Merger
Enhances Size, Improves Access to Capital Markets, and Increases Liquidity Options: The combined company will become a premier diversified REIT with a retail focus, with an enterprise value of approximately $3.9 billion1. Increased scale will enhance access to capital markets and increase liquidity options.
Improves Capital Structure: AFIN will have lower leverage with manageable near-term debt maturities and ample near-term liquidity. The improved capital structure also provides AFIN with a strong balance sheet for continued growth and acquisitions.
Creates Accretive Transaction: The transaction is expected to be accretive to AFIN's funds from operations per share in 2017 and strengthens the Company's distribution coverage.
Broadens Tenant Diversification: The addition of RCA's retail portfolio will broaden AFIN's retail tenant base and reduce AFIN's top 10 tenant concentration to 48% from 75% on an annualized straight-line rent basis as of June 30, 2016.
Significantly Reduces Fees and Creates Meaningful Synergies: Expected $10.9 million of annual savings in 2017 from $6.1 million in contractual asset management fee savings and $4.8 million in general and administrative expense savings.  Decreased management fees on future equity raised.
Creates Internalization Option: Creates a defined management internalization option under the AFIN advisory agreement benefiting shareholders at both companies. 
Terms of the Transaction and Timing
Under the terms of the agreement, RCA shareholders will receive 0.385 shares of AFIN common stock and $0.95 in cash for each share of RCA common stock they own. Upon closing, RCA shareholders will own approximately 37% of the combined company. The approximately 90% stock component of the transaction is expected to be tax-free to shareholders.
The merger agreement also provides RCA with a go-shop period during which time RCA will have the right to actively solicit alternative proposals from third parties for 45 days. The merger agreement provides for RCA to pay a termination fee of $5.1 million to AFIN if RCA terminates the merger agreement in connection with a superior proposal that arises on or before the date that is fifteen days following the end of the go-shop period. 
AFIN will add two independent directors to be appointed by RCA's board of directors, bringing to six the total number of directors for the combined company, five of them independent.
Completion of the transaction is subject to the approval of AFIN and RCA shareholders as well as satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.

I'm Not Feeling The Love With American Finance Trust - American Finance Trust, Inc (Pending:AFIN) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»I'm Not Feeling The Love With American Finance TrustApr.27.15 | About: American Finance (AFIN) Brad Thomas Dividend growth investing, REITs, newsletter provider, valueMarketplaceREIT BeatSummaryAs in any investment opportunity, it’s critical to dig deep into the motives of the management team.Remember that ARCT5 was aggregating capital using its non-traded REIT platform, so essentially the investors were paying $10.00 and only around $8.50 was being invested in the real estate.So now we have a new REIT (AFIN) hoping to crank up yet another round of musical chairs.The stage is set for another round of financial engineering, except this time, the magician is not around for the final liquidity event.Wow. Time flies. Just over 4 ½ year ago, I wrote my first article on American Realty Capital Properties (ARCP). I can't believe how the time went by so fast and I can never forget the composition of the portfolio at the time of the IPO. I explained it like this:
The biggest issue that I have with the IPO is that the assets are highly concentrated with just two tenants, and one of the two tenants is a troubled bank with minimum lease term remaining.
Some may recall that ARCP commenced with just two tenants - Home Depot (NYSE:HD) and Citizens Financial Group (NYSE:CFG). That's not that big of a deal though.
My biggest concern, however, was the fact that the management team (led by Nicholas Schorsch) was seeding the initial portfolio with properties that he owned, solely because his predecessor company was being forced to pay off the debt coming due.
I've never been a fan for owning bank branches. I used to travel to my bank a few times a month, now I may go inside a few times a year.
At the time of the ARCP IPO, the bank branches had a weighted lease term of 6.9 years. Now 4 ½ years have burned off so the Citizens Bank properties should have just over two years remaining (according to my calculations).
I summed up my frustration in an article I wrote on ARCP (over 4 years ago).
ARCP's 7% dividend sounds good on paper but an investor should always "peel back the onion" and understand the true meaning of the assets and the metrics that are driving the value creation strategies.

As in any investment opportunity, it's critical to dig deep into the motives of the management team. Ask yourself, "what is management doing for me?" and "does management's interest align with mine?"
Now, let's begin with another REIT called "American"…
American Finance Trust Inc.
On April 20th, New York-based American Realty Capital Trust V said it filed an application to list its common stock on the NYSE and concurrent with the listing, it intends to launch a tender offer and change its name to American Finance Trust Inc. (anticipated ticker is AFIN). Source: SNL Financial
Subject to the approval from the exchange, AFIN expects its common stock to begin trading on the NYSE during the third quarter upon listing. ARCT5's CEO and President, William Kahane, notified the company of his resignation and Nicholas Radesca notified the board of his resignation as the CFO, secretary and treasurer. The company's board appointed Donald MacKinnon as the CEO and president, effective as of May 4.
In addition, the company named Donald Ramon as CFO, secretary and treasurer. He will also serve as the CFO, secretary and treasurer of American Realty Capital Advisor V Inc. Ramon previously served as CFO of Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc. (NYSE:IVR). Andrew Winer was appointed as the company's chief investment officer, effective May 4.
UBS Securities LLC is acting as a financial adviser in connection with the listing. RCS Capital, the investment banking and capital markets division of Realty Capital Securities LLC, is also advising the company in connection with the listing.
In case you don't remember, ARCT5 is a non-traded REIT and the 4th in a vintage of illiquid funds created by Schrosch (with the name "American...").
The first was ARCT that was sold to Realty Income (NYSE:O). The second and third - ARCT3 (there was never an ARCT2) and ARCT4 was sold to ARCP. Also, remember that ARCP acquired Cole (a non-traded REIT) and in addition to ARCT 3 and 4 several other companies and portfolios: Caplease, Inland, GE Capital, and Fortress.

I'm fairly confident that it was Schorsch's intent to monetize ARCT5 by using the ARCP vehicle; however, given the fact that Schorsch is "out" and ARCP is "out of business" (as it relates to acquisitions), the new REIT - so named "American Finance Trust" - had no way to create liquidity than to create another REIT… but this one is different.
A Triple Net Hybrid
ARCT5 said it intends to commence a tender offer to purchase up to $125 million of its shares of common stock, subject to the listing and the filing of appropriate offering materials with the SEC. The tender offer would commence concurrently with or shortly following the listing.
In accordance with the terms of the tender offer, the company will offer to repurchase shares of its common stock at a purchase price of $25.50 per share. Assuming that trading of the company's common stock begins during the third quarter, the tender offer would also commence on the same day as the listing and will expire 20 business days afterwards, unless the company decides to extend the offer period.
Further, the company plans to expand its investment focus from net lease real estate to include originating and acquiring first mortgages and other commercial real estate debt securities. Seems like a hybrid of sorts.

It's clear to me that new AFIN management team is hoping to provide some unique operating model in which it can show the market that the company is truly unique (not competing with ARCP). If you recall, ARCP started its pitch by telling investors that it was going to own mid-term (really short-term) leases, primarily because the bank leases (referenced above) were mid-duration. Later, ARCP opted to modify its pitch.
It's interesting (not logical) to see AFIN moving into a space in which it hopes to compete with the net lease REITs as well as the commercial mortgage REITs. This reminds me of the same "anchor and buoy" model that ARCP touted a while back - just another seemingly "sucker yielding" approach to financial engineering in which it blends "bond-like" net lease exposure with higher risk commercial paper.

Before I rip the new venture into shreds, let's take a closer look. ARCT5 intends to expand its business from around $2.2 billion to around $4 billion. By combining the existing ARCT5 assets, AFIN hopes to aggregate debt obligations to balance the portfolio with a pro-forma debt / asset percentage of around 65% (1x to 2x debt/equity).

Once AFIN hits $4 billion (in assets) here's how the company will compare to the peer group:

It's really interesting to see Net Lease REITs and Commercial Mortgage REITs in the same peer group. These two asset classes are opposites and by combining low risk and high risk, AFIN plans to create a business model with shareholder's equity of around $1.4 billion.

AFIN management projects the dividend yield to be somewhere between 7.5% and 8.5%. Here's how that compares to the Commercial Mortgage peer group:


There are solid players in the Commercial Mortgage space today and I don't see any unique investment banking model with AFIN. I understand the opportunity to seize market share as a result of constrained bank lending (new Frank Dodd regulation); however, I'm not sure how a Net Lease REIT can flip a switch and decide to go "head to head" with the big boys (NRF, BXMT, and STWD).
In fact, I believe the Commercial Mortgage REIT model will be similar to the banking model. In other words, I see the opportunity for a few "super-regional players" like NRF and BXMT and more "localized" players like UDF and LOAN. I'm not feeling the attraction for a middle market player that also owns Net Lease. That model seems silly.

The Net Lease Portfolio
The more I ponder the new REIT offering, the more I become fixated on ARCP's IPO (over 4 years ago).
ARCT5 has 463 properties that comprise of 13.1 million square feet. The portfolio is 100% occupied (and it should be since the properties were acquired over the last 3 years) with a weighted average lease term of 9.7 years. The portfolio is 68.4% investment grade.

Now, let's examine the portfolio.


You can now see why I'm reminiscing about the ARCP IPO. As you can see, ARCT5's top tenant is SunTrust Banks (NYSE:STI). There are 213 bank branches that represent around 18% of ARCT5's revenue.
Remember that ARCT5 was aggregating capital using its non-traded REIT platform so essentially the investors were paying $10.00 and only around $8.50 was being invested in the real estate (15% load paid to brokers, etc.).
So when ARCT5 purchased the SunTrust portfolio (from Inland American Real Estate Trust) it was essentially over-paying by 15% (since Inland had acquired the properties using 15% load) and then ARCT5 charged its investors another 15% - essentially making the portfolio 30% more expensive because of the fees paid to brokers.
So now we have a new REIT (Pending:AFIN) hoping to crank up yet another round of musical chairs. Clearly, there's not enough "meat on the bone" for another existing REIT to buy the bank assets so the new REIT deal may be the only way for the company to create liquidity for investors.
The stage is set for another round of financial engineering, except this time, the magician is not around for the final liquidity event. Does that mean that AFIN could become the next American Financial Realty Trust (a similar REIT started by Schorsch in 2002 that later became a bomb)?
Likewise, there are many similarities to American Realty Capital Properties and American Finance Trust. Both have the name "American." Both invest in Net Lease assets. Both were started by Nicholas Schorsch. Both paid (or will pay) monthly dividends (ARCP suspended its dividend). Both commenced with a legacy portfolio of short-duration bank leases.
What's different? The magician is not around and the music is almost over. By disguising AFIN as a Commercial Mortgage REIT, the management team is hoping to create a differentiated vehicle that can last…I don't feel the love.
Be careful with this one. The thrill of victory may not be worth the agony of defeat.

American Realty Capital Trust (ARCT) isn't afraid to stand alone. The self-administered and self-advised real estate investment trust (REIT) owns a portfolio of more than 480 single-tenant, freestanding commercial properties (as opposed to strip malls or shopping centers with multiple tenants) located in 43 states and Puerto Rico. Nearly half of its properties are leased by top tenants, including the likes of Bridgestone, CVS, Dollar General, FedEx, PNC Bank, and Walgreens. Formed by American Realty Capital in 2007, the REIT went public via an IPO in 2012. In January 2013 Realty Income Corporation acquired ARCT for more than $3 billion in cash, stock, and debt.
