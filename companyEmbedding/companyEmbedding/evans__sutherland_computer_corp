David Bateman retires as CEO and Board member






September 06, 2016 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Evans & Sutherland Computer Corporation (Pink Sheets: ESCC), today 
      announced the appointment of Jonathan Shaw as Chief Executive Officer 
      and a member of the Board of Directors in connection with the retirement 
      of David Bateman as the Company’s CEO and Board member, and the 
      promotion of Kirk Johnson to President and Chief Operating Officer, both 
      effective immediately. Mr. Johnson will report to Mr. Shaw. As members 
      of the E&S Executive Management Team, they will work closely together on 
      product and strategy development, marketing and sales to drive value to 
      our customers, shareholders and employees.
    


      "We are extremely pleased that Jon has accepted the role of CEO of E&S," 
      said L. Tim Pierce, Chairman of the Board of the Company. "Jon has 
      served as the President of our wholly owned subsidiary, Spitz, Inc., for 
      more than 14 years. He has led all of the major initiatives that have 
      resulted in Spitz becoming a world leader in supplying dome projection 
      screens, education-focused planetariums, unique architectural structures 
      and developing opportunities in theme parks.”
    

      “I am honored to be given the opportunity to be E&S’s next CEO. It is a 
      privilege to be part of an organization with such a rich history and 
      capability. I look forward to working with the Board and the very 
      talented staff at E&S and Spitz to pursue future growth opportunities 
      and to maximize the value of our shareholders’ investment,” said Mr. 
      Shaw.
    

      Throughout his career, Mr. Shaw has successfully held senior-level 
      positions in operations, manufacturing, sales, product management, 
      marketing and general management. Mr. Shaw was appointed President and 
      Chief Executive Officer of E&S's subsidiary, Spitz, Inc., in November 
      2001, where he held various management positions since 1985. Prior to 
      Spitz, Jon held several engineering positions with Mobil Oil 
      Corporation. He holds a BS in Engineering from the University of 
      Delaware and an MBA from Widener University.
    

      Kirk Johnson will assume the role of President and Chief Operating 
      Officer. Mr. Johnson was appointed Vice President and General Manager of 
      E&S’s Digital Theater Division in 2002. He joined E&S in 1990 and held 
      various engineering and management positions prior to his VP role. Prior 
      to E&S, Mr. Johnson worked as an FCC compliance and regulatory engineer 
      and project manager at Communication Certification Laboratory. He holds 
      a BS in Electrical Engineering and an MBA, both from the University of 
      Utah.
    

      "We congratulate Kirk in his new role at E&S. It is very exciting to 
      have him expand his role on our Executive Management Team which will 
      allow him to utilize the skills, relationships and industry knowledge 
      that he has gained while working at E&S for the last 26 years," said Mr. 
      Pierce.
    

      “I look forward to working with the Board, Jon and our employees to 
      continue to provide the exceptional products and services that our 
      customers have come to expect from E&S. I am excited to more fully 
      integrate E&S and Spitz in order to consolidate costs, increase 
      profitability and grow our business,” said Mr. Johnson.
    

      "The entire Company is very grateful for the steady leadership Dave 
      Bateman has brought to his 10 years of service as our CEO,” Mr. Pierce 
      said. “Dave has tirelessly worked to resolve many significant challenges 
      faced by the Company, including the very important 2014 resolution of 
      the liabilities associated with the Company’s pension plan. He has been 
      a great leader and colleague and we wish him the best in retirement as 
      he moves to this next phase of his life.”

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes of Evans & Sutherland Computer Corporation and subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company," "E&S," "we," "us" and "our") included in Item 1 of Part I of this Form 10-Q. In addition to the historical information contained herein, this quarterly report on Form 10-Q includes certain "forward-looking" statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the fact they use words such as "should," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "target," "may," "project," "guidance," "intend," "plan," "believe" and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. One can also identify forward-looking statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Such forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including factors that could delay, divert or change any of them, and could cause actual outcomes to differ materially from current expectations. These statements are likely to relate to, among other things, the Company's goals, plans and projections regarding its financial position, results of operations, cash flows, market position, product development, sales efforts, expenses, performance or results of current and anticipated products and the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and financial results, which are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including internal or external factors that could delay, divert or change any of them in the next several years.  Although the Company believes it has been prudent in its plans and assumptions, no assurance can be given that any goal or plan set forth in forward-looking statements can be achieved and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such statements, which speak only as of the date made. The Company undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  All dollar amounts are in thousands.  Executive Summary  On April 21, 2015, the Company executed the Settlement Agreement to terminate its pension plan and to settle the underlying pension liabilities. This is a major milestone and completes a process that began over two years ago. The Company's goal in seeking a distress termination of the Pension Plan is to ensure that the pension benefits of all Pension Plan participants are paid up to federally guaranteed limits and that the Company continues to operate as a going concern while avoiding the costly damage and disruption to the business which would result from bankruptcy reorganization. We believe the Settlement Agreement has achieved that goal.  The first quarter of 2015 reported improved sales volume and $103 of net income compared to the first quarter of 2014, which reported a net loss of $551. The stronger sales and resulting net income in the first quarter of 2015 was attributable to stronger sales bookings over the past year. The sales backlog improved which creates an encouraging outlook for the remainder of 2015. With the improved backlog and strong sales prospects, we anticipate that sales and overall results for the remainder of 2015 will exceed the results from 2014.  We continue to expect variable but reasonably consistent future sales and gross profits from our current product line at annual levels sufficient to cover or exceed operating expenses. With the settlement of the Pension Plan liabilities, we expect an improved financial position that may present opportunities for better results through the availability of credit and stronger qualification for customer projects.  Critical Accounting Policies  Certain accounting policies are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our condensed consolidated financial statements. Their application requires significant management judgment, with financial reporting results relying on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of critical accounting policies can be found in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014. For all of these policies, management cautions that future results rarely develop exactly as forecasted, and the best estimates routinely require modification.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations  Sales and Backlog  The following table summarizes our sales:  For the Three Months Ended April 3, 2015 March 28, 2014 Sales $ 8,002 $ 6,672  Sales for the first three months of 2015 were 20% higher than the same period in 2014. The higher 2015 sales were attributable to progress and deliveries on larger customer contracts as compared to the same period of 2014.  Revenue backlog continued to improve totaling $34,324 as of April 3, 2015, compared to $28,173 as of December 31, 2014. We expect sales for the remainder of 2015 to result in total annual sales in excess of 2014 based on delivery schedules from the improved revenue backlog and strong sales prospects.  Gross Profit The following table summarizes our gross profit and the gross profit as a percentage of total sales: For the Three Months Ended April 3, 2015 March 28, 2014 Gross profit $ 2,991 $ 2,144 Gross profit percentage 37 % 32 %  Gross profit for the first quarter was favorably affected by higher sales volume which absorbed fixed overhead as well as sales from specific contracts with favorable margins.  Operating Expenses The following table summarizes our operating expenses: For the Three Months Ended April 3, 2015 March 28, 2014 Selling, general and administrative $ 1,842 $ 1,748 Research and development 595 560 Pension 375 209 Total operating expenses $ 2,850 $ 2,517  For the first quarter of 2015, selling, general and administrative expenses were higher than the comparable period of 2014 due primarily to a higher use of labor resources for sales and marketing activities.  For the first quarter of 2015, research and development expenses were higher than the comparable period of 2014. This was attributable primarily to engineering resources being redirected from customer projects and selling expenses to research and development activities.  Pension expense for the first quarter of 2015 was higher than the same period of 2014 because of actuarial estimates. With the termination of the Pension Plan, future pension expense will be reduced to the expenses attributable to the SERP.  Table of Contents  Other Expense, net  The following table summarizes our other expense:  For the Three Months Ended April 3, 2015 March 28, 2014 Total other expense, net $ (25) $ (169)  For the three months ended April 3, 2015, other expense, net, was less than the same period in 2014 due primarily to a decrease in interest expense. Interest expense was less than the prior period due to the extinguishment of the financing lease obligation as a result of the Company not exercising an option to purchase the subject real estate and entering into a new operating lease for that property.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Outlook  As discussed above in the executive summary and the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements, we have made significant progress in our effort to reverse our long history of operating losses and we believe that that the termination of the Pension Plan with the settlement of the underling pension liabilities achieved our goal of reducing our obligations to an amount which the business can sustain. As a result, we believe existing liquidity resources and funds generated from forecasted revenue will meet our current and long-term obligations upon adjustment for the settlement of the pension liabilities. We continue to operate in a rapidly evolving and often unpredictable business environment that may change the timing or amount of expected future cash receipts and expenditures.  Cash Flows  In the first three months of 2015, $2,652 of cash used in operating activities was attributable to $398 of cash from the net income for the period, after the effect of $295 of non-cash items plus an unfavorable change to working capital of $3,050. The change to working capital was driven by increases in inventory and receivables, attributable to the timing of billings and new customer orders.  In the first three months of 2014, $1,436 of cash provided by operating activities was attributable to $180 of cash absorbed by the net loss for the period, after the effect of $371 of non-cash items plus a favorable change to working capital of $1,616. The change to working capital was driven by progress payments from customer contracts, attributable to the timing of billings and new customer orders.  Cash used in investing activities was $14 in the first three months of 2015 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $49 for the same period of 2014. The Company had purchases of property and equipment of $14 in 2015 and no proceeds from sale of marketable securities. The Company had proceeds from marketable securities offset by purchases of property and equipment of $61 in 2014.  In the first three months of 2015, financing activities used $62 of cash compared to $43 in 2014, for principal payments on mortgage notes.  Table of Contents  Line of Credit  The Company is a party to a line of credit agreement with a commercial bank which, until October 3, 2014, permitted borrowings of up to $1,100 to fund Spitz working capital requirements. Under the line of credit agreement, interest is charged on amounts borrowed at the Wall Street Journal Prime Rate. Any borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by Spitz real and personal property and all of the outstanding shares of Spitz common stock. The line of credit agreement and mortgage notes contain cross default provisions whereby the default of either agreement will result in the default of both agreements. On October 3, 2014, the commercial bank notified the Company that it is no longer obligated to make advances under the line of credit agreement and elected to suspend future advances because of events of default on loan covenants resulting from the liens placed on the Company's assets by the Pension Plan. The Company believes that with the settlement of the pension liabilities, it will be able to comply with covenants as required by the commercial bank and that, later in 2015, the bank will permit new borrowings for potential working capital requirements. There were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit agreement during 2015 and 2014 and, as of April 3, 2015, there was no amount outstanding under the line of credit agreement.  Letters of Credit  Under the terms of financing arrangements for letters of credit, E&S is required to maintain a balance in a specific cash account equal to or greater than the outstanding value of all letters of credit or bank guarantees issued, plus other amounts necessary to adequately secure obligations with the financial institution. As of April 3, 2015, there were outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of $690, which are scheduled to expire during the current fiscal year.  Mortgage Notes  As of April 3, 2015, Spitz had obligations totaling $2,300 under its two mortgage notes payable.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Evans & Sutherland is a pioneering American computer firm in the computer graphics field. Its current products are used in digital projection environments like planetariums. Its simulation business, which it sold to Rockwell Collins, sold products that were used primarily by the military and large industrial firms for training and simulation.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1968 by David C. Evans and Ivan Sutherland, professors in the Computer Science Department at the University of Utah.
The two professors were pioneers in computer graphics technology. They formed the company to produce hardware to run the systems being developed in the University, working from an abandoned barracks on the university grounds. The company was later housed in the University of Utah Research Park. Most of the employees were active or former students, and included Jim Clark, who started Silicon Graphics, Ed Catmull, co-founder of Pixar, John Warnock of Adobe, and Scott P. Hunter of Oracle.
In the 1970s they purchased General Electric's flight simulator division and formed a partnership with Rediffusion Simulation, a UK-based flight simulator company, to design and build digital flight simulators. For the next three decades this was E&S's primary market, delivering display systems with enough brightness to light up a simulator cockpit to daytime light levels. These simulators were used for training in in-flight refueling, carrier landing, AWACS, B52 EVS, submarine periscope and space station docking.
In the mid 70s until the end of the 80s, E&S produced the Picture System 1, 2 and PS300 series. These unique "calligraphic" (vector) color displays had depth cueing and could draw large wireframe models and manipulate (rotate, shift, zoom) them in real time. They were mainly used in chemistry to visualize large molecules such as enzymes or polynucleotides. The end of the Picture System line came in the late 80s, when raster devices on workstations could render anti-aliased lines faster.
In 1978 the company went public with a listing on NASDAQ.
In the 1980s E&S added a Digital Theater division, supplying all-digital projectors to create immersive mass-audience experiences at planetariums, visitor attractions and similar education and entertainment venues. Digital Theater grew to become a major arm of E&S commercial activity with hundreds of Digistar 1 and 2 systems installed around the world, such as at the Saint Louis Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri.
For a brief period between 1986 and 1989 E&S was also a supercomputer vendor, but their ES-1 was released just as the supercomputer market was drying up in the post-cold war military wind-down. Only a handful of machines were built, most broken up for scrap.
During the 1990s E&S tried to expand into several other commercial markets. The Freedom Series graphics engine was developed to work with Sun Microsystems, IBM, Hewlett Packard, and DEC workstations. 3D Pro technology was developed for the first wave of 3D graphics cards for PCs. Also, the MindSet virtual set system was created to address the needs of the broadcast video market.
In 1993 Evans and Sutherland helped Japanese arcade giant Namco with texture-mapping technology in Namco's System 22 arcade board that powered Ridge Racer. The help that E&S gave Namco was similar to the help that Martin Marietta gave Sega with the MODEL 2 board that powered Daytona USA and Desert Tank arcade games.
In 1998 Evans and Sutherland acquired AccelGraphics Inc, a manufacturer of computer graphics boards, for $52m.[1]
Since its launch in July 2002, the company's Digistar 3 system became the world's fastest selling Digital Theater system and is installed in upwards of 120 fulldome venues worldwide.[citation needed]
On May 9, 2006 Evans & Sutherland acquired Spitz Inc, a rival vendor in the planetarium market, giving the combined business the largest base of installed planetaria worldwide and adding in-house projection-dome manufacturing capability to E&S' offering.
In 2006 Evans and Sutherland sold its simulation business to Rockwell Collins.[2]
Use in movies and special effects[edit]
An Evans & Sutherland computer was used in the creation of the Project Genesis simulation sequence in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, which was one of the first computer graphic sequences ever used in a movie. NBC would later use an Evans and Sutherland for its 1984–1985 promotional campaign "Let's All Be There!", as well as subsequent campaigns, concluding with the 1989–1990 season promotional campaign "Come Home to the Best!".[3][4]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1968 by David C. Evans and Ivan Sutherland, professors in the Computer Science Department at the University of Utah.
The two professors were pioneers in computer graphics technology. They formed the company to produce hardware to run the systems being developed in the University, working from an abandoned barracks on the university grounds. The company was later housed in the University of Utah Research Park. Most of the employees were active or former students, and included Jim Clark, who started Silicon Graphics, Ed Catmull, co-founder of Pixar, John Warnock of Adobe, and Scott P. Hunter of Oracle.
In the 1970s they purchased General Electric's flight simulator division and formed a partnership with Rediffusion Simulation, a UK-based flight simulator company, to design and build digital flight simulators. For the next three decades this was E&S's primary market, delivering display systems with enough brightness to light up a simulator cockpit to daytime light levels. These simulators were used for training in in-flight refueling, carrier landing, AWACS, B52 EVS, submarine periscope and space station docking.
In the mid 70s until the end of the 80s, E&S produced the Picture System 1, 2 and PS300 series. These unique "calligraphic" (vector) color displays had depth cueing and could draw large wireframe models and manipulate (rotate, shift, zoom) them in real time. They were mainly used in chemistry to visualize large molecules such as enzymes or polynucleotides. The end of the Picture System line came in the late 80s, when raster devices on workstations could render anti-aliased lines faster.
In 1978 the company went public with a listing on NASDAQ.
In the 1980s E&S added a Digital Theater division, supplying all-digital projectors to create immersive mass-audience experiences at planetariums, visitor attractions and similar education and entertainment venues. Digital Theater grew to become a major arm of E&S commercial activity with hundreds of Digistar 1 and 2 systems installed around the world, such as at the Saint Louis Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri.
For a brief period between 1986 and 1989 E&S was also a supercomputer vendor, but their ES-1 was released just as the supercomputer market was drying up in the post-cold war military wind-down. Only a handful of machines were built, most broken up for scrap.
During the 1990s E&S tried to expand into several other commercial markets. The Freedom Series graphics engine was developed to work with Sun Microsystems, IBM, Hewlett Packard, and DEC workstations. 3D Pro technology was developed for the first wave of 3D graphics cards for PCs. Also, the MindSet virtual set system was created to address the needs of the broadcast video market.
In 1993 Evans and Sutherland helped Japanese arcade giant Namco with texture-mapping technology in Namco's System 22 arcade board that powered Ridge Racer. The help that E&S gave Namco was similar to the help that Martin Marietta gave Sega with the MODEL 2 board that powered Daytona USA and Desert Tank arcade games.
In 1998 Evans and Sutherland acquired AccelGraphics Inc, a manufacturer of computer graphics boards, for $52m.[1]
Since its launch in July 2002, the company's Digistar 3 system became the world's fastest selling Digital Theater system and is installed in upwards of 120 fulldome venues worldwide.[citation needed]
On May 9, 2006 Evans & Sutherland acquired Spitz Inc, a rival vendor in the planetarium market, giving the combined business the largest base of installed planetaria worldwide and adding in-house projection-dome manufacturing capability to E&S' offering.
In 2006 Evans and Sutherland sold its simulation business to Rockwell Collins.[2]
Use in movies and special effects[edit]
An Evans & Sutherland computer was used in the creation of the Project Genesis simulation sequence in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, which was one of the first computer graphic sequences ever used in a movie. NBC would later use an Evans and Sutherland for its 1984–1985 promotional campaign "Let's All Be There!", as well as subsequent campaigns, concluding with the 1989–1990 season promotional campaign "Come Home to the Best!".[3][4]

Humpback Whales



Running Time: 40 minutes
Giant Screen Film Transfer






Narrated by two-time Golden Globe® nominee Ewan McGregor, Humpback Whales is an extraordinary journey into the mysterious world of one of nature's most awe-inspiring marine mammals. Set in the spectacular waters of Alaska, Hawaii and the remote islands of Tonga, this ocean adventure offers audiences an up-close look at how these whales communicate, sing, feed, play and take care of their young.   Captured for the first time with IMAX® 3D cameras, and found in every ocean on earth, humpbacks were nearly driven to extinction 50 years ago, but today are making a slow but remarkable recovery.  Join a team of researchers as they unlock the secrets of the humpback and find out why humpbacks are the most acrobatic of all whales, why they sing their haunting songs, and why these intelligent, 55-foot, 50-ton animals migrate up to 10,000 miles round-trip every year.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1968 by David C. Evans and Ivan Sutherland, professors in the Computer Science Department at the University of Utah.
The two professors were pioneers in computer graphics technology. They formed the company to produce hardware to run the systems being developed in the University, working from an abandoned barracks on the university grounds. The company was later housed in the University of Utah Research Park. Most of the employees were active or former students, and included Jim Clark, who started Silicon Graphics, Ed Catmull, co-founder of Pixar, John Warnock of Adobe, and Scott P. Hunter of Oracle.
In the 1970s they purchased General Electric's flight simulator division and formed a partnership with Rediffusion Simulation, a UK-based flight simulator company, to design and build digital flight simulators. For the next three decades this was E&S's primary market, delivering display systems with enough brightness to light up a simulator cockpit to daytime light levels. These simulators were used for training in in-flight refueling, carrier landing, AWACS, B52 EVS, submarine periscope and space station docking.
In the mid 70s until the end of the 80s, E&S produced the Picture System 1, 2 and PS300 series. These unique "calligraphic" (vector) color displays had depth cueing and could draw large wireframe models and manipulate (rotate, shift, zoom) them in real time. They were mainly used in chemistry to visualize large molecules such as enzymes or polynucleotides. The end of the Picture System line came in the late 80s, when raster devices on workstations could render anti-aliased lines faster.
In 1978 the company went public with a listing on NASDAQ.
In the 1980s E&S added a Digital Theater division, supplying all-digital projectors to create immersive mass-audience experiences at planetariums, visitor attractions and similar education and entertainment venues. Digital Theater grew to become a major arm of E&S commercial activity with hundreds of Digistar 1 and 2 systems installed around the world, such as at the Saint Louis Science Center in St. Louis, Missouri.
For a brief period between 1986 and 1989 E&S was also a supercomputer vendor, but their ES-1 was released just as the supercomputer market was drying up in the post-cold war military wind-down. Only a handful of machines were built, most broken up for scrap.
During the 1990s E&S tried to expand into several other commercial markets. The Freedom Series graphics engine was developed to work with Sun Microsystems, IBM, Hewlett Packard, and DEC workstations. 3D Pro technology was developed for the first wave of 3D graphics cards for PCs. Also, the MindSet virtual set system was created to address the needs of the broadcast video market.
In 1993 Evans and Sutherland helped Japanese arcade giant Namco with texture-mapping technology in Namco's System 22 arcade board that powered Ridge Racer. The help that E&S gave Namco was similar to the help that Martin Marietta gave Sega with the MODEL 2 board that powered Daytona USA and Desert Tank arcade games.
In 1998 Evans and Sutherland acquired AccelGraphics Inc, a manufacturer of computer graphics boards, for $52m.[1]
Since its launch in July 2002, the company's Digistar 3 system became the world's fastest selling Digital Theater system and is installed in upwards of 120 fulldome venues worldwide.[citation needed]
On May 9, 2006 Evans & Sutherland acquired Spitz Inc, a rival vendor in the planetarium market, giving the combined business the largest base of installed planetaria worldwide and adding in-house projection-dome manufacturing capability to E&S' offering.
In 2006 Evans and Sutherland sold its simulation business to Rockwell Collins.[2]
Use in movies and special effects[edit]
An Evans & Sutherland computer was used in the creation of the Project Genesis simulation sequence in Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, which was one of the first computer graphic sequences ever used in a movie. NBC would later use an Evans and Sutherland for its 1984–1985 promotional campaign "Let's All Be There!", as well as subsequent campaigns, concluding with the 1989–1990 season promotional campaign "Come Home to the Best!".[3][4]

Projector Solutions






Digistar Outreach
For portable or small theaters up to 10 meters (30 feet) the Digistar Outreach uses a single DLP projector with a fisheye lens in the center of the dome.



SP2 HD
For smaller domes that are up to 12 meters (40 feet) the Digistar SP2 HD system uses a high-resolution/high-brightness projector pair located in the center of the theater or in the theater's cove.



Single 4K Projector
This single 4K projector is mounted in the center of the theater with no blending required.







DLP 2K System
The typical DLP projection system uses five or six high-resolution/high-brightness projectors blended across the dome.



4K System
Two 4K projectors are mounted either in the center of the theater or in the front and back of the theater cove and are blended together in a single blend region across the dome.



8K or True8K System
Five or ten projectors are mounted in the theater cove and are blended together to create a seamless ultra-high-resolution image. The ideal solution to replace 1570 giant screen film systems.

It’s intuitive drag and drop architecture and simple controls for interacting directly with imagery on the dome have made Digistar software the choice of hundreds of theaters across the globe.





Interactive Dome View
Directly interact with the objects on your dome and add other items to the dome simply by clicking and dragging. The dome view also allows for panning and zooming and moving time forward and backward.




Information at Your Fingertips
Each object in Digistar comes with a detailed information page. This provides presenters with ready-access reference material to help them answer questions or to provide them with helpful data about any object in the system. Users can add their own notes or even live web links to these pages to make this information even more useful.





Multiple Stars, Variable Stars and Expoplanets
Dataset contains multiple stars, variable stars and exoplanets to explore, all available through Digistar's user interface. New sophisticated algorithms allow astronomical bodies to maintain accurate positions and sizes across the enormous range of astronomical scales.







User Interface Dark Mode
Designed for use in low light environments, dark mode reduces light scatter in the dome and preserves the operator's dark adaptation. Digistar features standard red mode and an alternate green mode to further minimize light output. A high-contrast monitor with a fully dimmable backlight is also available.




Astronomy Features
Digistar's user interface puts the system's vast amount of astronomical data at your fingertips in a variety of ways including shortcut buttons that group content by sky, planets & sun, Zodiacal constellations, Messier Objects, shows, trailers, etc. The user interface offers tagged searches, smart lists, and traditional folder views.




Seasonal Earth Textures
When viewing the Earth, Digistar displays surface imagery appropriate to the time of year.





Workspaces
Digistar 6 has an enormous library of content available. Workspaces are new a way to collect and organize that content for use in live presentations. These new presentations can then be controlled by an iPad, Bluetooth presentation remote or Xbox controller, enabling the presenter great flexibility to move around the dome and interact with the audience. Workspaces also allow users to create playlists of content for one-click playback of walk-in music, lighting scripts, trailers, full pre-rendered shows and other items.





Control Panels
Digistar allows users to customize control panels for their presentations that can be loaded onto an iPad or other mobile device. Users can then present their shows live in front of the audience using the control panels on their mobile device.







Show Builder
The fastest way to create content for the dome, Show Builder allows users to craft a show one snapshot at a time with an intuitive point-and-click process. Users can set up a scene on the dome using the tools within Digistar and then take a “snapshot” of the scene they created. By modifying this scene and taking successive snapshots, users build a show from beginning to end with available editing tools to adjust snapshot durations, transition timings, edit or insert snapshots into a sequence, and more. Show Builder shows can be converted to standard Digistar scripting language so that they can be further edited by users who prefer to write show scripts themselves.

Internationalization
Digistar's user interface and dome output can be changed to display in any language. Choose from the included languages, or import data to add new languages.




Intelligent Search
Digistar features a fully-integrated search engine that quickly allows users to find content in the system and drag it to the dome for immediate use.




Spice Toolkit
Where available, the positions of solar system bodies are now calculated using the Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides DE431, a numerical simulation of the Solar System created by Jet Propulsion Laboratory. We access the data kernels using the SPICE toolkit, a software package widely used for planning, visualizing, and archiving interplanetary spacecraft missions. This gives Digistar the ability to determine the positions of the planets, Pluto, and the Moon at high accuracy over a 30,000 year time span, as well as the positions of other major moons over a span of a few hundred years.




Intuitive Navigation
Navigation through the Universe in Digistar 6 has been completely redesigned to offer more intuitive “free flight” controls using the mouse, XBOX controller, or joystick. New features include a fly-to “target mode” that allows users to set a destination and fly to it manually.











Image Quality
Digistar 6 offers a variety of projection systems for domes of all sizes (3-30+ meters) with solutions ranging from a single projector 1K x 1K display to True8K™ resolution with 10 or more projectors to create the highest quality digital starfield and to exceed 1570 giant screen film resolution.

Up to 120 FPS Video Playback
Digistar 6 offers video and real time playback at up to 120 frames per second, four times the industry standard of 30 fps. By doubling or quadrupling the number of frames played back over the same amount of time, the perceived resolution of the scene goes up dramatically. Motion appears much crisper and less blurry since the human eye sees much more visual information every second.







Auto Alignment & Auto Blending
Optional systems that not only automatically align the geometry of multiple video projectors, but also adjust brightness and edge blending between projectors. With one click the system automatically aligns in only a few minutes to within .5 pixel accuracy.




High Definition Video Input
This optional live input accepts up to 1080 HD or SD video from a variety of sources including Blu-ray, DVD, satellite/cable, PC, and video cameras for real-time display anywhere on the dome. Real-time chroma keyer allows instant compositing of live video.






8K and True 8K™ Resolution
Digistar systems can provide the highest digital resolution currently available, up to True8K – a minimum of 8000 x 8000 pixels across every meridian in the dome.
