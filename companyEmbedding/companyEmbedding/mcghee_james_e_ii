James E. McGee, II
James McGee is a criminal defense attorney who specializes in cases involving complex violent crimes.  He is a former deputy district attorney and prosecuted cases on behalf of the County of San Bernardino for over twelve years.  During his time with the county, Mr. McGee handled a variety of cases including hardcore gang prosecutions, murders with special circumstances, wiretap prosecutions, insurance fraud, and mentally disordered offenders.
Mr. McGee was successful in numerous high profile prosecutions throughout his career with the County of San Bernardino.  One of his most notable achievements was a gang homicide trial, People v. James Bagsby.  After securing a conviction, Mr. McGee nominated Henry and Joseph Ramirez for the 2011 Patricia Lewis Witness of the Year Award.  Both Henry and Joseph Ramirez testified at the murder trial of James Bagsby and were instrumental in his conviction.  Mr. McGee was on hand to present the award to the Ramirez brothers on behalf of the California District Attorneys Association.
Mr. McGee’s background and experience has served him well as a criminal trial attorney and he has continued his success in the courtroom after beginning his criminal defense practice in 2014. While Mr. McGee is committed to defending individuals charged with violent felonies, he has also made himself available to fellow defense attorneys and is routinely contacted to give advice on complex cases and other legal matters.
As a Deputy District Attorney, Mr. McGee provided training and experience to law enforcement in the areas of gang case investigations, complex fraud investigations, and the law pertaining to testifying as a gang expert at the time of trial.  Mr. McGee continues to share his vast knowledge and expertise with fellow attorneys and has given lectures on topics such as using technology in the courtroom, using discovery to undermine a gang investigation, and the law on immunity.  Since 2008, Mr. McGee has participated in the Fontana Leadership Program (FLIP) by counseling troubled youth on the dangers of being involved in a gang lifestyle and the legal consequences of such activity.
Mr. McGee is a member of the Riverside County Bar Association, San Bernardino County Bar Association, California Attorneys for Criminal Justice and California Public Defenders Association.  Mr. McGee is a native of California, growing up in the Pomona area. He graduated from the University of California at Irvine with a Bachelor’s Degree in Philosophy, and obtained his Juris Doctorate Degree from Loyola Law School.
