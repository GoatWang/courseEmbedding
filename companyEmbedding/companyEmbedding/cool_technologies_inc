Applicationstjh1961tjh2017-06-15T02:42:35+00:00 
Cool Technologies' applicationsare extensiveOur thermal dispersion technology can cool electric motors, generators and alternators as well as vehicle components. The market in which our technology has the greatest short term potential is dry pit submersibles. At least 5 different markets which offer a total of 16 other applications remain to be pursued.
A primary benefit of our thermal technology is that it enables electric motors and generators to generate more power from the same size package.
Cool Technologies combines a thermally-enhanced motor with our parallel power platform to deliver an electric load assist or ELA to any internal combustion engine. The ELA forms the basis for our unique hybrid conversion system which has applications for all Class 3-8 trucks, buses and even off-road vehicles.
The proprietary technology integral to our parallel power platform can also be used to power an on-board generator from a vehicles internal combustion engine. The generator can then provide up to 300 kVA. The mobile auxiliary power system has applications for construction and utility trucks as well as military vehicles.

Third Party Testing

Home/Thermal Dispersion/Third Party Testing







Third Party Testingtjh1961tjh2015-08-20T14:47:11+00:00 
Three independent labs have tested Cool Technologies’ heat pipe architecture. Other tests have been conducted by electric motor manufacturers. None of our technologies have ever failed a third party test.
Test 1
In 2007, Essco Pumps & Controls, a member of the Hydraulic Institute, conducted the tests in accordance with standards set forth by the Institute. Essco assembled typical submersible motors: one standard submersible and one incorporating our technology.
Two tests were performed. The first was a back-to-back comparison with each operated in a dry-pit mode. The results: the standard submersible operated at full load for 15 minutes before it reached a Class F temperature and overheated. The Cool Technologies’ motor operated for 100 minutes before reaching Class F temperature.
The second test validated the heat removal capabilities of Cool Tech’s heat pipe architecture. By circulating a small amount of water (1/3 gpm) through the oil chamber, Cool Tech’s motor operated continuously without ever reaching Class F temperature.
What it means
With our technology, one design can do it all. A single motor rating can function in dry-pit, submersible and explosion-proof applications. Current pump manufacturing practice calls for a separate rating for each application.
Test 2
On December 6, 2013, ESSCO Pumps and Controls conducted a second test—the time using a dry pit submersible pump — with even better results.
Dry pit submersible pumps are commonly used in national, state and municipal waste water utilities worldwide as well as in the mining, dredging and oil drilling industries.
The tests examined the tolerances of an industrial electric motor in an extreme situation. The tolerances determine the amount of power that can be driven through pumps run by the motor and are a strong predictor of the maintenance and other service downtime the pump will require. The original pump motor was rated to run, without submersion, for up to 15 minutes before the pump’s protective circuits will turn it off to prevent overheating. This heat limitation restricts the output of the motor.
The test pump used the same industrial electric motor, except with our thermal dispersion technology incorporated. The result: the test pump ran without submersion for more than two hours at or above full power without reaching critical temperatures that would have caused an automatic shutdown.
What it means
The tests confirmed the company’s belief that our heat pipe cooling system equals the effectiveness of a more complex water-cooled system. Therefore, simple designs incorporating our thermal technology combined with the proven increase in potential output should result in lower costs to manufacture by reducing the amount of material needed to produce a pump or electric motor with a specific output.
Test 3
On December 13, 2013, Mohler Technology, Inc. of Boonville, Indiana tested an alternator enhanced with our technology. A 650kVA alternator (generator) was run at full load to test its operational limits. The heat produced by generators of that size must be removed or controlled in order for the alternator to operate effectively. Manufacturers’ current best practice is to add either a liquid cooling system or an extra large frame around the motor to provide additional surface area to help dissipate the heat. Both practices increase the cost and complexity of the generators.
650 kVA generators are commonly used in the mining, telecom, water treatment and oil and gas industries as well as used to provide back-up power for heavy industry, data centers and healthcare facilities.
The alternator tested used our thermal technology with no other cooling of any kind. The results showed a minimum of 25% improvement in power density over the manufacturer’s rating for the alternator when operated without water cooling. In fact, the alternator achieved power densities comparable to a liquid-cooled or over-framed one.
What it means
Once again, the tests confirmed our belief that our heat pipe cooling system equals the effectiveness of a more complex water-cooled system. Because motors equipped with our technology deliver more horsepower than any other motor of the same frame, designers now have flexibility. They can lower costs by using smaller pump or motor designs or they can deliver enhanced performance from their existing motor frames.

NY Times

DIESEL ENGINES

“Only about 14%–30% of the energy from the fuel you put in a conventional vehicle is used to move it down the road, depending on the drive cycle. The rest of the energy is lost to engine and driveline inefficiencies or used to power accessories.”

US Dept. of Energy
“…additional requirements for exhaust after treatment systems and emissions systems resulting in a weight increase of about 400 lbs.; and the weight of the cooling system increased by almost 200 lbs.”

US Dept. of Energy (Page 6)
“Cooling system problems are believed to cause about 40 percent of unanticipated downtime. Once problems from overheating start, they spread throughout the engine.”

Heavy Duty Trucking Magazine/truckinginfo.com
2. ELECTRIC MOTORS
“… electric motors, and the systems they drive, are the largest single consumer of electrical power. In aggregate, they use twice as much energy as lighting applications, which is the next largest user, … In fact, electric motors and the systems they drive account for approximately 50 percent of total global energy consumption.”

IHS Inc.
“Air has a low specific heat, low density, and low conductivity. These make it a poor heat transfer fluid and cause a number of design challenges.”

National Renewable Energy Laboratory (Page 28)
“Higher temperatures shorten motor life. For every 10°C rise in operating temperature, the insulation life is reduced by half.”

US Dept. of Energy
“It has been concluded that more than 55% of the insulating failures are caused by overheating.”

Bright Hub Engineering

“When power goes out in supermarkets, you’re talking thousands and thousands of dollars. Once it goes out over 24 hours, you start throwing your stock out, such as ice creams and frozen stuff.”


Australian Broadcasting Corporation
Future Applications4. BEARINGS
“Bearing failures account for nearly two-thirds of all motor failures. If not detected in time, the failing bearing can cause overheating and damage insulation, or can fail drastically and do irreparable mechanical damage to the motor.”

US Dept. of Energy
5. TURBINES
“As mobile turbine technology has developed and become available, utilities have turned to them rapidly …. Since 2011, turbine share has grown rapidly, from zero in 2010 to a 35% share of the 100-MW+ deal space in 2013. Approximately 20% of all fast-track power deals since 2012 have been for gas turbines.”

About Cool Technologies (formerly HPEV)

Home/Company/About Cool Technologies (formerly HPEV)







About Cool Technologies (formerly HPEV)tjh1961tjh2017-06-15T02:35:08+00:00 
 Cool Technologies, Inc. (OTCQB: WARM) was founded in February 2011 to commercialize a single patent: a composite heat pipe – a game changing solution to a universal problem.
Heat affects anything that moves or generates power. Heat degrades, warps or causes devices to fail outright.
The solution is to cool or remove the heat. Cooling lengthens product life and increases power. Get a motor to run cooler and it’ll generate more power. Cooling increases efficiency. More power with no increase in size is more energy efficient. Cooling reduces costs. Generate the same output from a smaller size and fewer raw materials are needed. The fewer raw materials needed, the less cost to manufacture. Combine that with increased product life and it reduces the cost to consumers. Finally, almost half of all electricity produced worldwide is consumed by motors and generators, so improving their efficiency saves energy. In other words, cooling is green.
The problem is removing heat adds cost and complexity to the end product.
Addressing A ProblemHeat pipes effectively remove heat without using pumps or moving parts. They’re passive and maintenance-free which is a key benefit because reliability is a critical issue. As a result, they’re far less expensive than mechanical cooling systems and devices.
Cool Technologies’ heat pipes surpass traditional heat pipes because they are the closest thing to super conductors. They offer virtually no resistance to thermal energy. The heat pipes quickly transfer heat in any direction, even against the pull of gravity and they’re effective in any shape or length. Because they’re sealed, they can be shaped to fit any design or mold including engine blocks. That eliminates the need for manufacturer retooling or redesign and minimizes capital investment.
An independent test demonstrated that Cool Technologies increased motor efficiency by 1 to 2 points and improved electric motor performance by 20-40%. That means a motor enhanced with our technology can deliver more power than other motor of its size and design on the market.
Any kind of electric motor: pump, compressor, generator; any kind of engine: gas, diesel, boat, jet can benefit.
Expanding the ApplicationsAfter starting with one patent, the company kept finding new applications and adding patents to its portfolio: submersible motors, hermetic motors and more.
In the meantime, Cool Technologies signed agreements with multinational manufacturers to test the technology in their respective product lines. One has completed a computer simulation, others are choosing products to prototype. But the company hasn’t stopped there.
Heat is a major cause of brake failure. Why not add the technology to brakes, rotors and calipers? Another inspiration, another patent-pending and an agreement signed with a racing team to test the technology in a Porsche GT3 Club Championship car. Another patent pending to cover applications for bearings soon followed as well.
 Combining the TechnologiesAn engineer had a brainstorm to combine technologies. His father had pioneered the use of electric vehicles in underground mining and as forklifts in the 1950’s. Why not take proven electric vehicle technology, match it with an electric motor that’s enhanced with thermal technology, add it to an internal combustion vehicle and enable the vehicle to run using whichever is most efficient for the driving conditions? It’ll reduce the load on the internal combustion engine which reduces fuel consumption and maintenance costs, lowers emissions and lengthens engine life. Add rechargeable batteries and it could turn any vehicle into a plug-in hybrid with what the company now refers to as ‘electric load assist’.
And so, another patent-pending and a new conversion targeting fleet and commercial markets facing stricter emissions regulations and increased fuel and other variable costs.
Another engineer realized that our patent-pending parallel power platform, which already forms the basis of our electric load assist, could also power an on-board generator.
Suddenly, the Ultimate Work Truck was born. Existing vehicles can be converted and provide up to 300kVA of auxiliary electric power (enough to power 40 typical US homes for 8 hours). No longer will companies have to tow generators to the work site nor idle the engine to operate bucket truck arms. Military units can set-up and power mobile bases with a single vehicle.
Sandy hits the East Coast. Businesses lose power. Stores are closed. Perishables spoil. We realize that our patent-pending gearing system could power an on-board generator solely from the vehicle’s internal combustion engine. Customers could enjoy the mobile auxiliary power benefits of the UWT without the need for hybrid conversion. One company expresses immediate interest and starts laying the groundwork for a deal.
The Cool Tech Business ModelCool Technologies, Inc. is not a manufacturing company. Every time the company finalizes a platform with a customer, the company will derive revenue in the form of a license and royalty. Or, in the case, of the case of the UWT and the mobile auxiliary power unit, we have set up a group of outsourced vendors and testing facilities that will enable the company to create products under our brand name and derive revenues as well.
Our mission is to find new applications for our patents and commercialize them. Since April 2011, the company has been awarded 7 patents and has another 7 patents pending.
In the meantime, the engineers are already thinking how they can use the technology to cool vehicle components, turbines, turbo chargers, automatic weapons…

Cool Technologies, Inc. Key Developments

Cool Technologies, Inc. Receives Order for 10 MG Systems
May 25 17
Cool Technologies, Inc. announced that it has received an order for ten Mobile Generation (MG) systems from Craftsmen. The 80 kVA systems are being purchased for installation in the mobile marketing vehicles, experiential marketing platforms and industrial mobile solutions that Craftsmen designs, engineers and produces. The industrial mobile solutions include mobile kitchens and offices as well as command and control centers for military, utility, rental and disaster relief usage. The systems will provide an alternative solution with a number of benefits to Craftsmen clients, especially space, weight and cost savings. CoolTech's generator systems will be installed on the tow vehicles or underneath the self-powered ones. This could free up to 400 square feet of space in the larger platforms. As the MG 80s deliver the same power at a fraction of the weight of tow behinds, they eliminate the need for the additional support, sound proofing and exhaust venting. Plus, less weight translates into better gas mileage for the vehicle or the one towing the mobile platform. Craftsmen's clients will also benefit from fewer maintenance requirements because the systems don't require a second engine to drive the generators. The cost savings over tow behinds will be an estimated 20% to start. That should increase as CoolTech ramps up production.

Why Choose Us?
At CoolChip Technologies our cooling solutions are not the status quo fan-cooled heat sink design of the last half-century. Our Kinetic Cooling Technology gets rid of the plastic fan and incorporates the heat sink assembly into a fully integrated forced convection cooling solution that we call a Kinetic Cooler. With the introduction of CoolChip Kinetic Cooling Technology, we deliver our customers thermal management products that empower them to unleash innovation that meets the needs of the modern era we live in.



“The number of transistors and resistors on a chip doubles every 24 months.”
Gordon MooreAuthor of Moore’s law
PreviousNext


Everything in computing has increased at an exponential rate: the amount of memory in our machines, the amount of storage, and number of transistors on a chip. Everything has changed except the fan-cooled heat sink; yet cooling is essential in protecting the electronics that have benefited from Moore’s Law.
Insufficient cooling limits processing power, shortens device lifespan and stifles innovation. These inefficiencies are major pain points! We at CoolChip believe that it’s just not cool that cooling has not kept pace. It is our innovative spirit and commitment to best-in-class engineering that allows us to be the only company to deliver the next-generation in thermal management solutions for consumer electronics and enterprise manufacturers. CoolChip Technologies’ patented and patent-pending Kinetic Cooling Engines provide significant advantages across the board of up to 50% improvement in cooling and can achieve up to a 2x smaller form factor at significantly lower noise levels*.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
