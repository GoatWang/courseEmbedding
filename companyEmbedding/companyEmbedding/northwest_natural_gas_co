BP U.S.


What we do


Exploration and Production


U.S. Lower 48



U.S. Lower 48







With a footprint that stretches from the Rocky Mountains to east Texas, BP’s Lower 48 onshore business is one of America’s largest natural gas producers. And it’s only getting bigger, recently having expanded operations in New Mexico.
 
The business produces natural gas — along with oil, condensate and gas liquids — from both conventional and unconventional rock formations. 

In 2015, it produced an average of 284,000 barrels of oil equivalent each day.
 
Headquartered in Houston, its operations span five states — Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming — and seven oil and gas basins, covering an area (5.7 million net acres) roughly the size of New Jersey.
 
While wholly owned by BP, the Lower 48 business began operating as a separate entity in 2015 in order to become more competitive in a rapidly changing exploration and production environment.The move has worked.
 
“Our new business model has allowed us to combine the resources and expertise of a major international oil and gas company, with the agility of an independent producer,” says Lower 48 CEO Dave Lawler. “We can allocate capital more efficiently, generate new project opportunities, and deliver innovative well designs and development programs much faster than in the past. This mix of capability and structure unlocks significant value from our large asset base, without compromising our commitment to safety and the environment.”
 
In 2015, the business bought all of Devon Energy’s assets in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, a region in which BP has operated for more than 30 years. The expansion added nearly 15,000 net acres to its portfolio.
 
With decades of experience in the San Juan Basin, BP has a deep understanding of its reservoirs, and the Lower 48 business has combined that knowledge with innovative technology to help boost production efficiency.
 
In 2015, for example, the company made history by completing its first-ever “multilateral” wells in the basin.
 
Multilateral wells feature multiple horizontal wells connected to a single drilling hole, or “wellbore,” allowing producers to access more of the oil and gas in a given reservoir while reducing the number of drilling sites.
 
The Lower 48 business expects that a majority of its new wells in the San Juan Basin will be multilaterals, and it is pursuing similar welldesign improvements across all its operations.

The Company's segments include Local Gas Distribution, Gas Storage and other. The Company maintains operations in Oregon, Washington and California and conducts businesses through NW Natural and its subsidiaries. The local gas distribution business, referred to as the utility segment, serves residential, commercial, and industrial customers in Oregon and southwest Washington, and the gas storage business, referred to as the gas storage segment, provides storage services for utilities, gas marketers, electric generators and industrial users from storage facilities located in Oregon and California. The Company's other segment is referred to as non-utility.Local Gas DistributionAs of December 31, 2016, the Company's utility is engaged in the regulated distribution of natural gas in Oregon and southwest Washington to over 725,000 customers. As of December 31, 2016, it provided natural gas service to over 100 cities in 18 counties with a population of 3.5 million in its service territory. Its utility segment is involved in building and maintaining pipeline distribution system, purchasing gas supplies from producers and marketers, contracting for the transportation of gas over pipelines from supply basins to its service territory, and reselling the gas to customers subject to rates, terms and conditions approved by the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC) or by the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (WUTC).Gas distribution also includes taking customer owned gas and transporting it from interstate pipeline connections, or city gates, to the customers' end use facilities for a fee, also approved by the OPUC or WUTC. The Company serves industrial sectors, such as pulp, paper, and other forest products; the manufacture of electronic, electrochemical and electrometallurgical products; the processing of farm and food products; the production of various mineral products; metal fabrication and casting; the production of machine tools, machinery and textiles; the manufacture of asphalt, concrete and rubber; printing and publishing; nurseries; government and educational institutions, and electric generation.Gas StorageThe Company's gas storage segment includes natural gas storage services provided to customers primarily from two underground natural gas storage facilities, its Gill Ranch gas storage facility, and the non-utility portion of its Mist gas storage facility. It also uses an independent energy marketing company to provide asset management services for utility and non-utility capacity. Earnings from non-utility assets at its Mist facility in Oregon are primarily related to firm storage capacity revenues. Earnings for the Mist facility also includes revenue, net of amounts shared with utility customers, from management of utility assets at Mist and upstream capacity when not needed to serve utility customers. Gill Ranch has a joint project agreement with Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) to own and operate the Gill Ranch underground natural gas storage facility near Fresno, California.OtherThe Company has non-utility investments and other business activities, which are aggregated and reported as other. The segment consists of an equity method investment in Trail West Holdings, LLC (TWH), which was formed to build and operate an interstate gas transmission pipeline in Oregon (TWP), and other pipeline assets in NNG Financial Corporation (NNG Financial). NNG Financial holds certain non-utility financial investments, but its assets consist of a subsidiary, which holds an interest in an approximately 18-mile interstate natural gas pipeline.

History[edit]
Portland Gas Light Company began as the first gas company in the Pacific Northwest in 1859, based on a perpetual charter by the territorial government.[2][3] The territorial government granted the charter in January 1859, only a month before Oregon became a state on February 14, at which time the Oregon Constitution became effective.[2] The Constitution would not have allowed this perpetual franchise had the Constitution been in effect at the time the charter was granted.[2] The company was started by H.C. Leonard and Henry D. Green, "colorful pioneers" who knew each other in New York, met again in San Francisco, and started a general store in Astoria in 1850.[2]
Moving to Portland in 1852, Green and Leonard built the first shipping dock in Portland.[2] They also operated as agents for Pacific Mail Steamship Company and exported goods to the Hawaiian Islands and Asia.[2] Their first coal gasification plant at Flanders and the waterfront operated on coal from Vancouver Island.[2] Gas began flowing in 1859, and the first gas lights were in a section of downtown Portland beginning June 1, 1860 and supplied 49 customers.[2][3] They incorporated as the Portland Gas Light Company in 1862 and purchased the Portland Water Company franchise.[2] They also created the East Portland Gas Light Company in 1882, creating a plant at East Second and Ankeny.[2]
Green died in 1885, and Leonard sold the Portland Water Company franchise to the city in December 1886.[2] The gas business was sold to bankers C.F. Adams and Abbot Low Mills in August 1892 for a reported $850,000.[2] Adams and Mills reincorporated as the Portland Gas Company and bought three other franchises, including the East Portland Gas Light Company.[2] They connected east and west Portland with a 10-inch gas main under the Willamette and then dismantled the eastern gas plant.[2]
In 1913, the company was sold to the American Power & Light Company for $3.5 million and was renamed the Portland Gas and Coke Company.[2][4][4] American Power was a subsidiary of the Electric Bond and Share Company of New York (EBASCO).[2] EBASCO was the holding company for small utilities owned by General Electric.[2] Using American Power's financing, Portland Gas supported the creation of St. Johns Gas Company in 1909, Clackamas County Gas Company in 1913, and acquired both companies in 1915.[2]
In the early days of the company, gas was manufactured from coal or oil in local plants.[4] This process ended with the arrival of natural gas to the region in the 1950s, and the company closed its last gas plant in 1957.[4]
In 1958, the company changed its name to Northwest Natural Gas Company.[4] During the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, the company continued to grow and expand its service area beyond Portland and the Willamette Valley.[4] By the end of 1989, the company had grown to serve over 300,000 residential customers.[5] The company’s name was changed again, from Northwest Natural Gas Company to NW Natural in 1997.[6]
NW Natural moved from the NASDAQ stock market to a listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NWN in 2000.[7] NW Natural attempted to purchase Portland General Electric, a Portland-based electricity utility, for nearly $3 billion beginning in October 2001 from Enron.[8][9] Due to issues including the bankruptcy of PGE parent Enron, the proposed merger was abandoned in May 2002.[8] For a fifth straight year Business Ethics magazine named NW Natural to its list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens, ranking 47th.[10]
On January 17, 2003, the board of directors of NW Natural Gas Co., dba NW Natural, announced the creation of a charitable fund at the Oregon Community Foundation to honor retiring Chief Executive Officer Richard G. Reiten. NW Natural donated $125,000 to create the NW Natural/Dick Reiten Leadership Fund.[11] On July 10, 2003, Northwest Natural Gas Company and Coos County broke ground for the county's natural gas transmission line and NW Natural's local distribution system in Coos Bay.[12]
In 2005, the company began removing tar from the site of a former plant that had polluted the Willamette River[13] and were later fined for actions related to that clean-up.[14] In 2007, NW Natural announced plans to construct a new pipeline for delivery of natural gas,[15] and announced a rate cut for the first time in six years.[16]
Services[edit]




Corporate headquarters in Portland


NW Natural is Oregon’s largest natural gas utility. It serves customers along the Oregon Coast, in the Willamette Valley, the Columbia River Gorge, and the Portland metropolitan area.[17] The company operates an underground natural gas storage facility near Mist, Oregon, in the Northern Oregon Coast Range utilizing depleted gas wells, as well as a facility near Fresno, California.[18] These former wells allow the company to purchase the gas when prices are lower and store until needed during peak consumption times during the winter.[18]

History[edit]
Portland Gas Light Company began as the first gas company in the Pacific Northwest in 1859, based on a perpetual charter by the territorial government.[2][3] The territorial government granted the charter in January 1859, only a month before Oregon became a state on February 14, at which time the Oregon Constitution became effective.[2] The Constitution would not have allowed this perpetual franchise had the Constitution been in effect at the time the charter was granted.[2] The company was started by H.C. Leonard and Henry D. Green, "colorful pioneers" who knew each other in New York, met again in San Francisco, and started a general store in Astoria in 1850.[2]
Moving to Portland in 1852, Green and Leonard built the first shipping dock in Portland.[2] They also operated as agents for Pacific Mail Steamship Company and exported goods to the Hawaiian Islands and Asia.[2] Their first coal gasification plant at Flanders and the waterfront operated on coal from Vancouver Island.[2] Gas began flowing in 1859, and the first gas lights were in a section of downtown Portland beginning June 1, 1860 and supplied 49 customers.[2][3] They incorporated as the Portland Gas Light Company in 1862 and purchased the Portland Water Company franchise.[2] They also created the East Portland Gas Light Company in 1882, creating a plant at East Second and Ankeny.[2]
Green died in 1885, and Leonard sold the Portland Water Company franchise to the city in December 1886.[2] The gas business was sold to bankers C.F. Adams and Abbot Low Mills in August 1892 for a reported $850,000.[2] Adams and Mills reincorporated as the Portland Gas Company and bought three other franchises, including the East Portland Gas Light Company.[2] They connected east and west Portland with a 10-inch gas main under the Willamette and then dismantled the eastern gas plant.[2]
In 1913, the company was sold to the American Power & Light Company for $3.5 million and was renamed the Portland Gas and Coke Company.[2][4][4] American Power was a subsidiary of the Electric Bond and Share Company of New York (EBASCO).[2] EBASCO was the holding company for small utilities owned by General Electric.[2] Using American Power's financing, Portland Gas supported the creation of St. Johns Gas Company in 1909, Clackamas County Gas Company in 1913, and acquired both companies in 1915.[2]
In the early days of the company, gas was manufactured from coal or oil in local plants.[4] This process ended with the arrival of natural gas to the region in the 1950s, and the company closed its last gas plant in 1957.[4]
In 1958, the company changed its name to Northwest Natural Gas Company.[4] During the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, the company continued to grow and expand its service area beyond Portland and the Willamette Valley.[4] By the end of 1989, the company had grown to serve over 300,000 residential customers.[5] The company’s name was changed again, from Northwest Natural Gas Company to NW Natural in 1997.[6]
NW Natural moved from the NASDAQ stock market to a listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NWN in 2000.[7] NW Natural attempted to purchase Portland General Electric, a Portland-based electricity utility, for nearly $3 billion beginning in October 2001 from Enron.[8][9] Due to issues including the bankruptcy of PGE parent Enron, the proposed merger was abandoned in May 2002.[8] For a fifth straight year Business Ethics magazine named NW Natural to its list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens, ranking 47th.[10]
On January 17, 2003, the board of directors of NW Natural Gas Co., dba NW Natural, announced the creation of a charitable fund at the Oregon Community Foundation to honor retiring Chief Executive Officer Richard G. Reiten. NW Natural donated $125,000 to create the NW Natural/Dick Reiten Leadership Fund.[11] On July 10, 2003, Northwest Natural Gas Company and Coos County broke ground for the county's natural gas transmission line and NW Natural's local distribution system in Coos Bay.[12]
In 2005, the company began removing tar from the site of a former plant that had polluted the Willamette River[13] and were later fined for actions related to that clean-up.[14] In 2007, NW Natural announced plans to construct a new pipeline for delivery of natural gas,[15] and announced a rate cut for the first time in six years.[16]
Services[edit]




Corporate headquarters in Portland


NW Natural is Oregon’s largest natural gas utility. It serves customers along the Oregon Coast, in the Willamette Valley, the Columbia River Gorge, and the Portland metropolitan area.[17] The company operates an underground natural gas storage facility near Mist, Oregon, in the Northern Oregon Coast Range utilizing depleted gas wells, as well as a facility near Fresno, California.[18] These former wells allow the company to purchase the gas when prices are lower and store until needed during peak consumption times during the winter.[18]

BP U.S.


What we do


Exploration and Production


U.S. Lower 48



U.S. Lower 48







With a footprint that stretches from the Rocky Mountains to east Texas, BP’s Lower 48 onshore business is one of America’s largest natural gas producers. And it’s only getting bigger, recently having expanded operations in New Mexico.
 
The business produces natural gas — along with oil, condensate and gas liquids — from both conventional and unconventional rock formations. 

In 2015, it produced an average of 284,000 barrels of oil equivalent each day.
 
Headquartered in Houston, its operations span five states — Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming — and seven oil and gas basins, covering an area (5.7 million net acres) roughly the size of New Jersey.
 
While wholly owned by BP, the Lower 48 business began operating as a separate entity in 2015 in order to become more competitive in a rapidly changing exploration and production environment.The move has worked.
 
“Our new business model has allowed us to combine the resources and expertise of a major international oil and gas company, with the agility of an independent producer,” says Lower 48 CEO Dave Lawler. “We can allocate capital more efficiently, generate new project opportunities, and deliver innovative well designs and development programs much faster than in the past. This mix of capability and structure unlocks significant value from our large asset base, without compromising our commitment to safety and the environment.”
 
In 2015, the business bought all of Devon Energy’s assets in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, a region in which BP has operated for more than 30 years. The expansion added nearly 15,000 net acres to its portfolio.
 
With decades of experience in the San Juan Basin, BP has a deep understanding of its reservoirs, and the Lower 48 business has combined that knowledge with innovative technology to help boost production efficiency.
 
In 2015, for example, the company made history by completing its first-ever “multilateral” wells in the basin.
 
Multilateral wells feature multiple horizontal wells connected to a single drilling hole, or “wellbore,” allowing producers to access more of the oil and gas in a given reservoir while reducing the number of drilling sites.
 
The Lower 48 business expects that a majority of its new wells in the San Juan Basin will be multilaterals, and it is pursuing similar welldesign improvements across all its operations.

History[edit]
Portland Gas Light Company began as the first gas company in the Pacific Northwest in 1859, based on a perpetual charter by the territorial government.[2][3] The territorial government granted the charter in January 1859, only a month before Oregon became a state on February 14, at which time the Oregon Constitution became effective.[2] The Constitution would not have allowed this perpetual franchise had the Constitution been in effect at the time the charter was granted.[2] The company was started by H.C. Leonard and Henry D. Green, "colorful pioneers" who knew each other in New York, met again in San Francisco, and started a general store in Astoria in 1850.[2]
Moving to Portland in 1852, Green and Leonard built the first shipping dock in Portland.[2] They also operated as agents for Pacific Mail Steamship Company and exported goods to the Hawaiian Islands and Asia.[2] Their first coal gasification plant at Flanders and the waterfront operated on coal from Vancouver Island.[2] Gas began flowing in 1859, and the first gas lights were in a section of downtown Portland beginning June 1, 1860 and supplied 49 customers.[2][3] They incorporated as the Portland Gas Light Company in 1862 and purchased the Portland Water Company franchise.[2] They also created the East Portland Gas Light Company in 1882, creating a plant at East Second and Ankeny.[2]
Green died in 1885, and Leonard sold the Portland Water Company franchise to the city in December 1886.[2] The gas business was sold to bankers C.F. Adams and Abbot Low Mills in August 1892 for a reported $850,000.[2] Adams and Mills reincorporated as the Portland Gas Company and bought three other franchises, including the East Portland Gas Light Company.[2] They connected east and west Portland with a 10-inch gas main under the Willamette and then dismantled the eastern gas plant.[2]
In 1913, the company was sold to the American Power & Light Company for $3.5 million and was renamed the Portland Gas and Coke Company.[2][4][4] American Power was a subsidiary of the Electric Bond and Share Company of New York (EBASCO).[2] EBASCO was the holding company for small utilities owned by General Electric.[2] Using American Power's financing, Portland Gas supported the creation of St. Johns Gas Company in 1909, Clackamas County Gas Company in 1913, and acquired both companies in 1915.[2]
In the early days of the company, gas was manufactured from coal or oil in local plants.[4] This process ended with the arrival of natural gas to the region in the 1950s, and the company closed its last gas plant in 1957.[4]
In 1958, the company changed its name to Northwest Natural Gas Company.[4] During the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, the company continued to grow and expand its service area beyond Portland and the Willamette Valley.[4] By the end of 1989, the company had grown to serve over 300,000 residential customers.[5] The company’s name was changed again, from Northwest Natural Gas Company to NW Natural in 1997.[6]
NW Natural moved from the NASDAQ stock market to a listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NWN in 2000.[7] NW Natural attempted to purchase Portland General Electric, a Portland-based electricity utility, for nearly $3 billion beginning in October 2001 from Enron.[8][9] Due to issues including the bankruptcy of PGE parent Enron, the proposed merger was abandoned in May 2002.[8] For a fifth straight year Business Ethics magazine named NW Natural to its list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens, ranking 47th.[10]
On January 17, 2003, the board of directors of NW Natural Gas Co., dba NW Natural, announced the creation of a charitable fund at the Oregon Community Foundation to honor retiring Chief Executive Officer Richard G. Reiten. NW Natural donated $125,000 to create the NW Natural/Dick Reiten Leadership Fund.[11] On July 10, 2003, Northwest Natural Gas Company and Coos County broke ground for the county's natural gas transmission line and NW Natural's local distribution system in Coos Bay.[12]
In 2005, the company began removing tar from the site of a former plant that had polluted the Willamette River[13] and were later fined for actions related to that clean-up.[14] In 2007, NW Natural announced plans to construct a new pipeline for delivery of natural gas,[15] and announced a rate cut for the first time in six years.[16]
Services[edit]




Corporate headquarters in Portland


NW Natural is Oregon’s largest natural gas utility. It serves customers along the Oregon Coast, in the Willamette Valley, the Columbia River Gorge, and the Portland metropolitan area.[17] The company operates an underground natural gas storage facility near Mist, Oregon, in the Northern Oregon Coast Range utilizing depleted gas wells, as well as a facility near Fresno, California.[18] These former wells allow the company to purchase the gas when prices are lower and store until needed during peak consumption times during the winter.[18]

History[edit]
Portland Gas Light Company began as the first gas company in the Pacific Northwest in 1859, based on a perpetual charter by the territorial government.[2][3] The territorial government granted the charter in January 1859, only a month before Oregon became a state on February 14, at which time the Oregon Constitution became effective.[2] The Constitution would not have allowed this perpetual franchise had the Constitution been in effect at the time the charter was granted.[2] The company was started by H.C. Leonard and Henry D. Green, "colorful pioneers" who knew each other in New York, met again in San Francisco, and started a general store in Astoria in 1850.[2]
Moving to Portland in 1852, Green and Leonard built the first shipping dock in Portland.[2] They also operated as agents for Pacific Mail Steamship Company and exported goods to the Hawaiian Islands and Asia.[2] Their first coal gasification plant at Flanders and the waterfront operated on coal from Vancouver Island.[2] Gas began flowing in 1859, and the first gas lights were in a section of downtown Portland beginning June 1, 1860 and supplied 49 customers.[2][3] They incorporated as the Portland Gas Light Company in 1862 and purchased the Portland Water Company franchise.[2] They also created the East Portland Gas Light Company in 1882, creating a plant at East Second and Ankeny.[2]
Green died in 1885, and Leonard sold the Portland Water Company franchise to the city in December 1886.[2] The gas business was sold to bankers C.F. Adams and Abbot Low Mills in August 1892 for a reported $850,000.[2] Adams and Mills reincorporated as the Portland Gas Company and bought three other franchises, including the East Portland Gas Light Company.[2] They connected east and west Portland with a 10-inch gas main under the Willamette and then dismantled the eastern gas plant.[2]
In 1913, the company was sold to the American Power & Light Company for $3.5 million and was renamed the Portland Gas and Coke Company.[2][4][4] American Power was a subsidiary of the Electric Bond and Share Company of New York (EBASCO).[2] EBASCO was the holding company for small utilities owned by General Electric.[2] Using American Power's financing, Portland Gas supported the creation of St. Johns Gas Company in 1909, Clackamas County Gas Company in 1913, and acquired both companies in 1915.[2]
In the early days of the company, gas was manufactured from coal or oil in local plants.[4] This process ended with the arrival of natural gas to the region in the 1950s, and the company closed its last gas plant in 1957.[4]
In 1958, the company changed its name to Northwest Natural Gas Company.[4] During the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, the company continued to grow and expand its service area beyond Portland and the Willamette Valley.[4] By the end of 1989, the company had grown to serve over 300,000 residential customers.[5] The company’s name was changed again, from Northwest Natural Gas Company to NW Natural in 1997.[6]
NW Natural moved from the NASDAQ stock market to a listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NWN in 2000.[7] NW Natural attempted to purchase Portland General Electric, a Portland-based electricity utility, for nearly $3 billion beginning in October 2001 from Enron.[8][9] Due to issues including the bankruptcy of PGE parent Enron, the proposed merger was abandoned in May 2002.[8] For a fifth straight year Business Ethics magazine named NW Natural to its list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens, ranking 47th.[10]
On January 17, 2003, the board of directors of NW Natural Gas Co., dba NW Natural, announced the creation of a charitable fund at the Oregon Community Foundation to honor retiring Chief Executive Officer Richard G. Reiten. NW Natural donated $125,000 to create the NW Natural/Dick Reiten Leadership Fund.[11] On July 10, 2003, Northwest Natural Gas Company and Coos County broke ground for the county's natural gas transmission line and NW Natural's local distribution system in Coos Bay.[12]
In 2005, the company began removing tar from the site of a former plant that had polluted the Willamette River[13] and were later fined for actions related to that clean-up.[14] In 2007, NW Natural announced plans to construct a new pipeline for delivery of natural gas,[15] and announced a rate cut for the first time in six years.[16]
Services[edit]




Corporate headquarters in Portland


NW Natural is Oregon’s largest natural gas utility. It serves customers along the Oregon Coast, in the Willamette Valley, the Columbia River Gorge, and the Portland metropolitan area.[17] The company operates an underground natural gas storage facility near Mist, Oregon, in the Northern Oregon Coast Range utilizing depleted gas wells, as well as a facility near Fresno, California.[18] These former wells allow the company to purchase the gas when prices are lower and store until needed during peak consumption times during the winter.[18]

NW Natural, formerly Northwest Natural Gas Company, is an American publicly-traded utility headquartered in Portland, Oregon, United States. Primarily a natural gas distributor, the company services residential, commercial, and industrial customers in Western Oregon and Southwest Washington in the Pacific Northwest. Founded in 1859, the company has approximately 680,000 customers and revenues of nearly one billion in US dollars annually.[1]

History[edit]
Portland Gas Light Company began as the first gas company in the Pacific Northwest in 1859, based on a perpetual charter by the territorial government.[2][3] The territorial government granted the charter in January 1859, only a month before Oregon became a state on February 14, at which time the Oregon Constitution became effective.[2] The Constitution would not have allowed this perpetual franchise had the Constitution been in effect at the time the charter was granted.[2] The company was started by H.C. Leonard and Henry D. Green, "colorful pioneers" who knew each other in New York, met again in San Francisco, and started a general store in Astoria in 1850.[2]
Moving to Portland in 1852, Green and Leonard built the first shipping dock in Portland.[2] They also operated as agents for Pacific Mail Steamship Company and exported goods to the Hawaiian Islands and Asia.[2] Their first coal gasification plant at Flanders and the waterfront operated on coal from Vancouver Island.[2] Gas began flowing in 1859, and the first gas lights were in a section of downtown Portland beginning June 1, 1860 and supplied 49 customers.[2][3] They incorporated as the Portland Gas Light Company in 1862 and purchased the Portland Water Company franchise.[2] They also created the East Portland Gas Light Company in 1882, creating a plant at East Second and Ankeny.[2]
Green died in 1885, and Leonard sold the Portland Water Company franchise to the city in December 1886.[2] The gas business was sold to bankers C.F. Adams and Abbot Low Mills in August 1892 for a reported $850,000.[2] Adams and Mills reincorporated as the Portland Gas Company and bought three other franchises, including the East Portland Gas Light Company.[2] They connected east and west Portland with a 10-inch gas main under the Willamette and then dismantled the eastern gas plant.[2]
In 1913, the company was sold to the American Power & Light Company for $3.5 million and was renamed the Portland Gas and Coke Company.[2][4][4] American Power was a subsidiary of the Electric Bond and Share Company of New York (EBASCO).[2] EBASCO was the holding company for small utilities owned by General Electric.[2] Using American Power's financing, Portland Gas supported the creation of St. Johns Gas Company in 1909, Clackamas County Gas Company in 1913, and acquired both companies in 1915.[2]
In the early days of the company, gas was manufactured from coal or oil in local plants.[4] This process ended with the arrival of natural gas to the region in the 1950s, and the company closed its last gas plant in 1957.[4]
In 1958, the company changed its name to Northwest Natural Gas Company.[4] During the 1960s, 70s, and 80s, the company continued to grow and expand its service area beyond Portland and the Willamette Valley.[4] By the end of 1989, the company had grown to serve over 300,000 residential customers.[5] The company’s name was changed again, from Northwest Natural Gas Company to NW Natural in 1997.[6]
NW Natural moved from the NASDAQ stock market to a listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NWN in 2000.[7] NW Natural attempted to purchase Portland General Electric, a Portland-based electricity utility, for nearly $3 billion beginning in October 2001 from Enron.[8][9] Due to issues including the bankruptcy of PGE parent Enron, the proposed merger was abandoned in May 2002.[8] For a fifth straight year Business Ethics magazine named NW Natural to its list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens, ranking 47th.[10]
On January 17, 2003, the board of directors of NW Natural Gas Co., dba NW Natural, announced the creation of a charitable fund at the Oregon Community Foundation to honor retiring Chief Executive Officer Richard G. Reiten. NW Natural donated $125,000 to create the NW Natural/Dick Reiten Leadership Fund.[11] On July 10, 2003, Northwest Natural Gas Company and Coos County broke ground for the county's natural gas transmission line and NW Natural's local distribution system in Coos Bay.[12]
In 2005, the company began removing tar from the site of a former plant that had polluted the Willamette River[13] and were later fined for actions related to that clean-up.[14] In 2007, NW Natural announced plans to construct a new pipeline for delivery of natural gas,[15] and announced a rate cut for the first time in six years.[16]
Services[edit]




Corporate headquarters in Portland


NW Natural is Oregon’s largest natural gas utility. It serves customers along the Oregon Coast, in the Willamette Valley, the Columbia River Gorge, and the Portland metropolitan area.[17] The company operates an underground natural gas storage facility near Mist, Oregon, in the Northern Oregon Coast Range utilizing depleted gas wells, as well as a facility near Fresno, California.[18] These former wells allow the company to purchase the gas when prices are lower and store until needed during peak consumption times during the winter.[18]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
