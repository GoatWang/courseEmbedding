The prospectuses for the Funds describe their respective  Portfolios,  including
the risks of investing in the Portfolios,  and provide other  information on the
Funds.                                                                          

AUL  guarantees  that the Death  Benefit  Proceeds  will  never be less than the
specified  Death Benefit in force (less any  outstanding  loan and loan interest
and plus any benefits provided by rider) so long as sufficient premiums are paid
to keep the Policy in force.                                                    

The Policy  provides  for a Net Cash Value that can be obtained by  surrendering
the Policy.  Because this value is based on the performance of the Portfolios of
the Funds, there is no guaranteed minimum Net Cash Value.                       

If the Net Cash Value is insufficient  to cover the Monthly  Deduction under the
Policy,  the Policy will lapse without value.  The Policy also permits loans and
Partial Surrenders, within limits.                                              

It may not be  advantageous  to replace  existing  insurance  with this  Policy.
Within certain limits,  you may return the Policy,  or exchange it for a paid-up
policy for a reduced Death Benefit that provides  benefits that do not vary with
the investment results of a separate account.                                   

THIS  PROSPECTUS  PRESENTS THE  INFORMATION  YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE  DECIDING TO
PURCHASE A POLICY. IT SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.  PROSPECTUSES FOR
THE FUNDS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS PROSPECTUS.                   
AN INVESTMENT IN THE POLICY IS NOT A DEPOSIT OR OBLIGATION  OF, OR GUARANTEED OR
ENDORSED  BY, ANY BANK,  NOR IS THE  POLICY  FEDERALLY  INSURED  BY THE  FEDERAL
DEPOSIT INSURANCE  CORPORATION OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT  AGENCY. AN INVESTMENT IN
THE POLICY  INVOLVES  CERTAIN  RISKS,  INCLUDING  THE LOSS OF  PREMIUM  PAYMENTS
(PRINCIPAL).                                                                    
THESE  SECURITIES  HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR  DISAPPROVED  BY THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE  COMMISSION OR ANY STATE  SECURITIES  COMMISSION NOR HAS THE SECURITIES
AND  EXCHANGE  COMMISSION  OR ANY STATE  SECURITIES  COMMISSION  PASSED UPON THE
ACCURACY OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A
CRIMINAL OFFENSE.

 SUMMARY AND DIAGRAM OF THE POLICY

The following summary of Prospectus information and diagram of the Policy should
be read in conjunction with the detailed information appearing elsewhere in this
Prospectus.  Unless otherwise  indicated,  the description of the Policy in this
Prospectus  assumes that the Policy is in force, that the Last Survivor Rider is
not in force, and that there are no outstanding loans and loan interests.       

The Policy is  similar in many ways to  fixed-benefit  life  insurance.  As with
fixed-benefit  life  insurance,  typically  the Owner of a Policy  pays  premium
payments for insurance  coverage on the Insured.  Also, like  fixed-benefit life
insurance, the Policy provides for accumulation of premiums and a Net Cash Value
that is payable if the Policy is surrendered during the Insured's  lifetime.  As
with  fixed-benefit  life insurance,  the Net Cash Value during the early Policy
Years is likely to be lower than the premium payments paid.                     

However,  the  Policy  differs  from  fixed-benefit  life  insurance  in several
important respects.  Unlike fixed-benefit life insurance,  the Death Benefit may
and the Account  Value will  increase  or  decrease  to reflect  the  investment
performance  of the  Investment  Accounts to which  Account  Value is allocated.
Also,  there is no guaranteed  minimum Net Cash Value.  If the Net Cash Value is
insufficient to pay the Monthly  Deduction,  the Policy will lapse without value
after a grace  period.  See  "Premium  Payments  to Prevent  Lapse." If a Policy
lapses while loans are outstanding,  adverse tax  consequences  may result.  See
"Tax Considerations."                                                           

The most  important  features of the Policy,  such as  charges,  cash  surrender
benefits,  Death Benefit,  and calculation of Cash Values, are summarized in the
diagram on the following pages.                                                 

     Purpose  of the  Policy.  The  Policy  is  designed  to  provide  long-term
insurance benefits,  and may also provide long-term  accumulation of Cash Value.
The Policy should be evaluated in conjunction with other insurance policies that
you own, as well as the need for insurance and the Policy's long-term  potential
for growth.  It may not be advantageous to replace existing  insurance  coverage
with this Policy. In particular,  replacement should be carefully  considered if
the decision to replace  existing  coverage is based  solely on a comparison  of
Policy  illustrations.  See  "Illustrations"  below and "Specialized Uses of the
Policy."

Illustrations.  Illustrations  included  in  this  Prospectus  or  used  in
connection with the purchase of a Policy that illustrate  Policy Cash Values and
Death Benefit Proceeds for prototype insureds are based on hypothetical rates of
return.                                                                         

The   illustrations   show  Policy   values   based  on  current   charges  and,
alternatively,  based on  guaranteed  charges.  See  "Illustrations  of  Account
Values, Net Cash Values, Death Benefits and Accumulated Premium Payments."

     Policy Tax Compliance. AUL intends for the Policy to satisfy the definition
of a life  insurance  policy under Section 7702 of the Internal  Revenue Code of
1986,  as amended  (the  "Internal  Revenue  Code").  It is  expected  that most
Policies will be treated as modified endowment contracts ("Modified Endowments")
under  federal tax law. AUL will monitor the Policies and will attempt to notify
you on a timely basis if your Policy is in jeopardy of violating the federal tax
definition  of life  insurance.  For further  discussion  of the tax status of a
Policy and the tax consequences of being treated as a life insurance contract or
a Modified Endowment, see "Tax Considerations."                                 

     Right to Examine Policy and Policy  Exchange.  For a limited time, you have
the right to cancel  your  Policy  and  receive a refund.  See "Right to Examine
Policy."  Premiums are  generally  allocated to the  Investment  Accounts on the
later of the day the "right to examine" period  expires,  or the date we receive
the premium at our Home Office. See "Premium Allocations and Crediting."        

You may  exchange  the Policy for a paid-up  whole life policy with a level face
amount, not greater than the Policy's Face Amount,  that can be purchased by the
Policy's Net Cash Value. See "Exchange for Paid-Up Policy."                     

     Owner Inquiries. If you have any questions,  you may write or call our Home
Office at One American Square, P.O. Box 7127, Indianapolis,  Indiana 46206-7127,
1-800-863-9354.

Premium Payments

You may elect to pay an initial  premium  payment that is equivalent to 80%, 90%
or 100% of the Initial  Maximum Premium plan but are not required to pay premium
payments according to the plan.                                                 

The Policy's  maximum  initial premium payment depends on the Insured's age, sex
and risk class, initial Face Amount selected,  and any supplemental and/or rider
benefits.                                                                       

Extra premium payments may be necessary to prevent lapse.

         Alger American Growth Portfolio. The Alger American Growth Portfolio is
a growth  portfolio  that  seeks to obtain  long-term  capital  appreciation  by
investing in a diversified,  actively  managed  portfolio of equity  securities.
Except during temporary defensive periods, the Portfolio invests at least 65% of
its  total  assets  in  equity  securities  of  companies  that,  at the time of
purchase, have a total market capitalization of one billion dollars or greater.

         American  Century  VP  Capital  Appreciation  Portfolio.  The  American
Century VP Capital  Appreciation  Portfolio  seeks  capital  growth by investing
primarily in common stocks (including securities  convertible into common stocks
and other equity equivalents) and other securities that meet certain fundamental
and technical standards of selection and have, in the opinion of the Portfolio's
investment  manager,  better  than  average  potential  for  appreciation.   The
Portfolio  tries to stay fully  invested in such  securities,  regardless of the
movement of prices generally.                                                   

         American  Century VP International  Portfolio.  The American Century VP
International  Portfolio  seeks to achieve its  investment  objective of capital
growth by  investing  primarily in  securities  of foreign  companies  that meet
certain  fundamental  and  technical  standards  of selection  and have,  in the
opinion of the investment  manager,  potential for  appreciation.  The Portfolio
will invest primarily in common stocks (defined to include  depository  receipts
for common stock and other equity equivalents) of such companies.  Investment in
securities of foreign issuers  typically  involves a greater degree of risk than
investment in domestic securities.

          VIP II Contrafund  Portfolio.  The VIP II Contrafund  Portfolio  seeks
capital  appreciation  by investing  primarily in companies that the managers of
the Portfolio believe to be undervalued due to an overly  pessimistic  appraisal
by the public.

duplicate the  composition  and total return of the Standard & Poor's  Composite
Index of 500 Stocks.

(1)  AUL has currently agreed to waive its advisory fee if the ordinary expenses
     of a Portfolio exceed 1% and, to the extent necessary,  assume any expenses
     in excess  of its  advisory  fee so that the  expenses  of each  Portfolio,
     including the advisory fee but excluding  extraordinary  expenses, will not
     exceed 1% of the  Portfolio's  average daily net asset value per year.  The
     Company may terminate  the policy of reducing its fee and/or  assuming Fund
     expenses  upon 30 days  written  notice to the Fund and such policy will be
     terminated  automatically  by the  termination of the  Investment  Advisory
Agreement.

(2)  A portion of the brokerage  commissions  that certain funds pay was used to
     reduce  funds  expenses.  In  addition,  certain  funds have  entered  into
     arrangements  with their  custodian  and transfer  agent  whereby  interest
     earned  on  uninvested  cash  balances  was used to  reduce  custodian  and
     transfer agent expenses.  Including these  reductions,  the total operating
     expenses presented in the table would have been 0.56% for the Equity-Income
     Portfolio,  0.67% for the Growth Portfolio,  0.92% for Overseas  Portfolio,
    0.73% for Asset Manager Portfolio, and 0.71% for the Contrafund Portfolio.

(3)  Fidelity  Management  & Research  Company  agreed to reimburse a portion of
     Index  500   portfolio's   expenses   during  the  period.   Without   this
     reimbursement, the fund's management fee, other expenses and total expenses
     would  have  been  0.28%,  0.15%,  and  0.43%  respectively  for  Index 500
Portfolio on an annualized basis.                                     

(4)  T. Rowe Price's  management fee includes the ordinary expenses of operating
the Portfolio.                                                        

More detailed information  concerning the investment  objectives,  policies, and
restrictions  pertaining  to  the  Funds  and  Portfolios  and  their  expenses,
investment  advisory  services and charges and the risks involved with investing
in the  Portfolios  and other  aspects of their  operations  can be found in the
current  prospectus  for each Fund or  Portfolio  and the current  Statement  of
Additional  Information  for each Fund or Portfolio.  The  prospectuses  for the
Funds or  Portfolios  should  be read  carefully  before  any  decision  is made
concerning  the  allocation  of Net  Premium  payments  or  transfers  among the
Investment Accounts.                                                            

AUL has  entered  into  agreements  with the  Distributors/Advisers  of American
Century Variable  Portfolios,  Inc. and Fidelity Investments under which AUL has
agreed to render certain services and to provide  information  about these Funds
to Owners who invest in these Funds.  Under these  agreements  and for providing
these services, AUL receives compensation from the  Distributor/Advisor of these
Funds  ranging from zero basis points until a certain  level of Fund assets have
been  purchased to fifteen  basis points on the net average  aggregate  deposits
made.                                                                           

AUL cannot  guarantee  that each Fund or Portfolio  will always be available for
the  Policies;  but,  in the  unlikely  event  that a Fund or  Portfolio  is not
available,  AUL will take  reasonable  steps to  secure  the  availability  of a
comparable  fund.  Shares of each  Portfolio  are  purchased and redeemed at net
asset value, without a sales charge.                                            

PREMIUM PAYMENTS AND ALLOCATIONS

Applying for a Policy                                                           

AUL requires satisfactory evidence of the proposed Insured's insurability, which
may include a medical  examination of the proposed Insured.  The available Issue
Ages are 0 through 85 on a standard basis.  Issue Age is determined based on the
Insured's age as of the Contract Date.  Acceptance of an application  depends on
AUL's  underwriting  rules, and AUL reserves the right to reject an application.
Coverage  under the Policy is  effective as of the later of the date the initial
premium is paid or the Issue Date.                                              

P-->49718th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�18th
As the Owner of the  Policy,  you may  exercise  all rights  provided  under the
Policy while the Insured is living,  subject to the interests of any assignee or
irrevocable  beneficiary.  The Insured is the Owner, unless a different Owner is
named in the application.  In accordance with the terms of the Policy, the Owner
may in the  application  or by Proper  Notice name a  contingent  Owner or a new
Owner while the Insured is living.  The Policy may be jointly owned by more than
one Owner.  The consent of both joint  Owners is required  for all  transactions
except when proper forms have been  executed to allow one Owner to make changes.
Unless a  contingent  Owner has been named,  on the death of the last  surviving
Owner, ownership of the Policy passes to the estate of the last surviving Owner,
which then will become the Owner.  A change in Owner may have tax  consequences.
See "Tax Considerations."

Right to Examine Policy                                                         

You may cancel your Policy for a refund  during your "right to examine"  period.
This period expires 10 days after you receive your Policy. We assume you receive
your Policy 5 days after the Issue Date. If you decide to cancel the Policy, you
must  return it by mail or other  delivery  method to the Home  Office or to the
authorized AUL representative who sold it. Immediately after mailing or delivery
of the Policy to AUL, the Policy will be deemed void from the beginning.  Within
seven calendar days after AUL receives the returned Policy,  AUL will refund the
greater of premiums paid or the Account Value.                                  

Premiums                                                                        

The Policy  permits  the Owner to pay a large  single  premium  and,  subject to
restrictions,  additional premiums. The minimum initial premium payment required
depends  on a number  of  factors,  such as the Age,  sex and risk  class of the
proposed  Insured,  the initial  Face  Amount,  any  supplemental  and/or  rider
benefits and the premium payments you propose to make. You may elect the initial
premium to be 80%,  90% or 100% of the  Initial  Maximum  Premium.  The  Initial
Maximum  Premium is less than or equal to the maximum  premium  that can be paid
for a given Face  Amount in order for an  insurance  policy to qualify as a life
insurance  contract  for tax  purposes.  Consult  your  AUL  representative  for
information about the initial premium required for the coverage you desire.     

The initial premium is due on or before delivery of the Policy. There will be no
coverage until this premium is paid or until the Issue Date, whichever is later.

You may make other  premium  payments at any time and in any amount,  subject to
the limits described in this section. The actual amount of premium payments will
affect the Account Value and the period of time the Policy remains in force.    

Premium payments after the initial payment must be made to our Home Office. Each
payment must be at least equal to the minimum  payment  shown on the Policy Data
Page in your  Policy.  All premiums  combined  may not be more than  $1,000,000,
unless a higher amount is agreed to by us.                                      

P-->49719th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�19th
If the payment of any premium would cause an increase in Risk Amount  because of
the  Minimum  Insurance  Percentage,  we may  require  satisfactory  evidence of
insurability before accepting it. If we accept the premium, we will allocate the
premium to your Account Value on the date of our acceptance. If we do not accept
the premium, we will refund it to you.                                          

If the  payment  of any  premium  would  cause  this  Policy to fail to meet the
federal tax  definition  of a life  insurance  contract in  accordance  with the
Internal  Revenue  Code,  we reserve  the right to refund the amount to you with
interest no later than 60 days after the end of the Policy Year which we receive
the premium, but we assume no obligation to do so.                              

Each premium after the initial premium must be at least $1,000. AUL may increase
this  minimum  90 days  after we send you a  written  notice  of such  increase.
However AUL reserves  the right to limit the amount of a premium  payment or the
total premium payments paid.                                                    

Premium Payments to Prevent Lapse                                               

The Policy goes into default at the start of the grace period, which is a period
to make a premium payment  sufficient to prevent lapse.  The grace period starts
if the Net Cash Value on a Monthiversary will not cover the Monthly Deduction. A
premium  sufficient  to keep the  Policy in force must be  submitted  during the
grace period.                                                                   

AUL will send  notice of the grace  period  and the amount  required  to be paid
during  the grace  period to your last known  address.  The grace  period  shall
terminate as of the date  indicated  in the notice,  which shall comply with any
applicable  state law. The grace period will begin when the notice is sent. Your
Policy will remain in force during the grace period.  If the Insured  should die
during the grace period, the Death Benefit Proceeds will still be payable to the
beneficiary,  although the amount paid will reflect a reduction  for the Monthly
Deductions  due on or  before  the  date of the  Insured's  death  (and  for any
outstanding loan and loan interest).  See "Amount of Death Benefit Proceeds." If
the grace period premium payment has not been paid before the grace period ends,
your Policy will lapse. It will have no value,  and no benefits will be payable.
See  "Reinstatement."  A grace period also may begin if any outstanding loan and
loan interest becomes excessive. See "Policy Loans."

Premium Allocations and Crediting                                               

In the  Policy  application,  you  specify  the  percentage  of a premium  to be
allocated to each Investment  Account.  The sum of your  allocations  must equal
100%,  with at least 1% of the  premium  payment  allocated  to each  Investment
Account selected by you. All premium  allocations must be in whole  percentages.
AUL  reserves  the right to limit the  number of  Investment  Accounts  to which
premiums may be  allocated.  You can change the  allocation  percentages  at any
time, subject to these rules, by sending Proper Notice to the Home Office, or by
telephone if written  authorization is on file with us. The change will apply to
the premium payments received with or after receipt of your notice.             

P-->49720th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
The  initial  premium  generally  is  allocated  to the  Investment  Accounts in
accordance with your allocation  instructions on the later of the day the "right
to  examine"  period  expires,  or the date we receive  the  premium at our Home
Office.  Subsequent premiums are allocated as of the end of the Valuation Period
during which we receive the premium at our Home Office.                         

We  generally  allocate  all  premiums  received  prior to the Issue Date to our
general  account  prior to the end of the  "right to  examine"  period.  We will
credit interest daily on premiums so allocated. However, we reserve the right to
allocate  premiums  to the  Investment  Accounts  of  the  Separate  Account  in
accordance  with your  allocation  instructions  prior to the  expiration of the
"right to examine" period.  If you exercise your right to examine the Policy and
cancel it by  returning  it to us,  we will  refund  to you the  greater  of any
premiums paid or the Account Value. At the end of the "right to examine" period,
we transfer the premium and interest to the Investment  Accounts of the Separate
Account  based on the  percentages  you have  selected in the  application.  For
purposes of determining the end of the "right to examine"  period,  solely as it
applies to this  transfer,  we assume that receipt of this Policy  occurs 5 days
after the Issue Date.                                                           

Premium payments  requiring  satisfactory  evidence of insurability  will not be
credited to the Policy until  underwriting  has been  completed  and the premium
payment has been accepted.  If the additional  premium payment is rejected,  AUL
will  return  the  premium  payment  immediately,  without  any  adjustment  for
investment experience.                                                          

Transfer Privilege                                                              

You may transfer amounts among Investment  Accounts at any time after the "right
to examine" period.                                                             

There currently is no minimum transfer amount,  although we reserve the right to
require a $100 minimum  transfer.  You must transfer the minimum amount,  or, if
less, the entire amount in the account from which you are transferring each time
a transfer is made. If after the transfer the amount remaining in any account is
less than $25, we have the right to transfer the entire  amount.  Any applicable
transfer  charge  will be  assessed.  The  charge  will  be  deducted  from  the
account(s) from which the transfer is made on a prorata basis.                  

Transfers  are made such that the Account Value on the date of transfer will not
be affected by the transfer,  except for the  deduction of any transfer  charge.
Currently,  all transfers are free. On a guaranteed  basis, we reserve the right
to limit the number of transfers to 12 per year, or to restrict  transfers  from
being made on consecutive Valuation Dates.                                      

If we determine  that the  transfers  made by or on behalf of one or more Owners
are to the  disadvantage of other Owners,  we may restrict the rights of certain
Owners.  We also reserve the right to limit the size of transfers  and remaining
balances,  to limit the number and  frequency of transfers,  and to  discontinue
telephone transfers.                                                            

P-->49721st�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�21st
The first 12  transfers  during  each  Policy  Year are free.  Any  unused  free
transfers  do not carry over to the next  Policy  Year.  We reserve the right to
assess a $25 charge for the thirteenth  and each  subsequent  transfer  during a
Policy Year. For the purpose of assessing the charge, each request (or telephone
request  described  below) is considered  to be one transfer,  regardless of the
number of  Investment  Accounts  affected  by the  transfer.  The charge will be
deducted from Investment Account(s) from which the transfer are made.           

         Telephone   Transfers.   Telephone   transfers   will  be  based   upon
instructions given by telephone, provided the appropriate election has been made
at the time of application or proper  authorization  has been provided to us. We
reserve the right to suspend telephone transfer  privileges at any time, for any
reason, if we deem such suspension to be in the best interests of Owners.       

We will employ reasonable  procedures to confirm that instructions  communicated
by telephone  are genuine,  and if we follow  those  procedures,  we will not be
liable for any losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent instructions.  We may be
liable for such  losses if we do not follow  those  reasonable  procedures.  The
procedures we will follow for telephone transfers include requiring some form of
personal  identification prior to acting on instructions  received by telephone,
providing written  confirmation of the transaction,  and making a tape recording
of the instructions given by telephone.                                         

Dollar Cost Averaging Program                                                   

The  Dollar  Cost  Averaging  Program,  if  elected,  enables  you  to  transfer
systemically  and  automatically,  on a monthly basis,  specified dollar amounts
from The AUL  American  Money  Market  Investment  Account  to other  Investment
Accounts. By allocating on a regularly scheduled basis, as opposed to allocating
the total amount at one  particular  time,  you may be less  susceptible  to the
impact of market  fluctuations.  However,  we make no guarantee  that the Dollar
Cost Averaging Program will result in a gain.                                   

You specify the fixed dollar amount to be transferred automatically from the AUL
American Money Market Investment  Account. At the time that you elect the Dollar
Cost  Averaging  Program,  the Account  Value in the AUL  American  Money Market
account from which transfers will be made must be at least $2,000.              

You may  elect  this  program  at the  time of  application  by  completing  the
authorization  on the  application  or at any time after the Policy is issued by
properly  completing and returning the election  form.  Transfers made under the
Dollar  Cost  Averaging  Program  will  commence  on  Monthiversary  on or  next
following the election.                                                         

P-->49722nd�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�22nd
Once elected,  transfers from the AUL American Money Market  Investment  Account
will be  processed  until  the value of the  Investment  Account  is  completely
depleted, or you send us Proper Notice instructing us to cancel the transfers.  

Currently,  transfers made under the Dollar Cost  Averaging  Program will not be
subject to any  transfer  charge and will not count  against  the number of free
transfers  permitted  in a Policy  Year.  We  reserve  the right to impose a $25
transfer  charge  for  each  transfer  effected  under a Dollar  Cost  Averaging
Program.  We also  reserve the right to alter the terms or suspend or  eliminate
the availability of the Dollar Cost Averaging Program at any time.              

Portfolio Rebalancing Program                                                   

You may  elect  to have  the  accumulated  balance  of each  Investment  Account
redistributed to equal a specified percentage of the Variable Account. This will
be done on an  annual  basis  from  the  Monthiversary  on which  the  Portfolio
Rebalancing Program commences.  If elected,  this program  automatically adjusts
your Portfolio mix to be consistent with the allocation most recently requested.
The  redistribution  will not count toward the 12 free transfers  permitted each
Policy  Year.  If the  Dollar  Cost  Averaging  Program  has been  elected,  the
Portfolio   Rebalancing  Program  will  not  commence  until  the  Monthiversary
following the termination of the Dollar Cost Averaging Program.                 

You may  elect  this  program  at the  time of  application  by  completing  the
authorization  on the  application  or at any time after the Policy is issued by
properly  completing  the  election  form  and  returning  it to  us.  Portfolio
rebalancing  will  terminate when you request any transfer or the day we receive
Proper Notice instructing us to cancel the Portfolio  Rebalancing Program. We do
not currently  charge for this program.  We reserve the right to alter the terms
or suspend or eliminate the availability of portfolio rebalancing at any time.  

CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS

Monthly Deduction                                                               

AUL will deduct Monthly Deductions for the Contract Date and each Monthiversary.
Monthly Deductions due on the Contract Date and any Monthiversaries prior to the
Issue Date are deducted on the Issue Date.  Your  Contract Date is the date used
to determine your  Monthiversary.  The Monthly Deduction consists of (1) cost of
insurance charge, (2) monthly  administrative  charge, (3) mortality and expense
risk  charge,  (4) tax  charges,  and (5) any  charges  for rider  benefits,  as
described below. The Monthly  Deduction is deducted from the Investment  Account
prorata on the basis of the portion of Account Value in each account.           

P-->49723rd�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
         Cost of Insurance Charge.  This charge  compensates AUL for the expense
of providing insurance coverage. The charge depends on a number of variables and
therefore  will  vary  between  Policies,  and may vary  from  Monthiversary  to
Monthiversary.  The Policy contains  guaranteed cost of insurance rates that may
not  be  increased.   The  guaranteed   rates  are  no  greater  than  the  1980
Commissioners  Standard  Ordinary  Non-Smoker and Smoker  Mortality  Tables (the
"1980 CSO Tables")  (and where unisex cost of  insurance  rates apply,  the 1980
CSO-C  Tables).  The  guaranteed  rates  for  substandard  classes  are based on
multiples of or  additives to the 1980 CSO Tables.  These rates are based on the
Attained Age and underwriting  class of the Insured.  They are also based on the
sex of the Insured,  except that unisex rates are used where  appropriate  under
applicable law, including in the state of Montana,  and in Policies purchased by
employers  and employee  organizations  in  connection  with  employment-related
insurance or benefit  programs.  The cost of insurance rate generally  increases
with the  Attained  Age of the Insured.  As of the date of this  Prospectus,  we
charge "current rates" that are generally lower (i.e.,  less expensive) than the
guaranteed  rates,  and we may also  charge  current  rates in the  future.  The
current rates may also vary with the Attained Age,  gender,  where  permissible,
duration,  policy size and underwriting class of the Insured, or, alternatively,
may be a charge  against  Account  Value that does not vary with Attained Age or
gender,  and may vary with underwriting  class. For any Policy, the current cost
of insurance on a  Monthiversary  is calculated  in one of two ways:  (1) if the
Initial Maximum  Premium is paid, the cost of insurance  equals the lesser of an
amount  equal,  on an annual  basis,  to a percentage  multiplied by the Account
Value or an amount equal to the Risk Amount multiplied by the guaranteed maximum
cost of insurance rate set forth in the Policy;  or (2) if less than the Initial
Maximum  Premium is paid, the cost of insurance is calculated by multiplying the
current  cost of  insurance  rate for the  Insured  by the Risk  Amount for that
Monthiversary.  We reserve  the right to change the  current  cost of  insurance
rates,  and, in the case of payment of the Initial Maximum Premium,  to assess a
cost of insurance  charge  calculated  solely by multiplying the current cost of
insurance  rate for the Insured by the Risk Amount for a  Monthiversary,  in the
same manner as the cost of insurance  charge  currently is calculated  when less
than the Initial Maximum Premium is paid. The Risk Amount on a Monthiversary  is
the difference  between the Death Benefit  divided by 1.00246627 and the Account
Value.                                                                          

AUL  places the  Insured  in a risk class when the Policy is given  underwriting
approval,  based on AUL's underwriting of the application.  AUL currently places
Insureds in a standard class based on underwriting.  An Insured may be placed in
a  substandard  risk  class,  which  involves a higher  mortality  risk than the
standard  classes.  Standard  rates are  available  for  Issue  Ages  0-89.  The
guaranteed  maximum cost of insurance  rate is set forth on the Policy Data Page
of your Policy.                                                                 

         Monthly  Administrative  Charge. The monthly administrative charge is a
level monthly  charge that is guaranteed  not to exceed,  on an annual basis,  a
rate of 0.40% of Account  Value.  We reserve the right to charge a lower current
rate. This charge reimburses AUL for expenses incurred in the  administration of
the  Policies and the  Separate  Account.  Such  expenses  include,  but are not
limited to: underwriting and issuing the Policy,  confirmations,  annual reports
and account statements,  maintenance of Policy records,  maintenance of Separate
Account records,  administrative personnel costs, mailing costs, data processing
costs,  legal fees,  accounting  fees,  filing fees, the costs of other services
necessary for Owner  servicing and all  accounting,  valuation,  regulatory  and
updating requirements.                                                          

P-->49724th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
         Mortality  and Expense Risk Charge.  AUL deducts a monthly  charge from
the  Investment  Accounts  prorata  based on your amounts in each  account.  The
current  charge is at an annual rate of 0.90% of Variable  Account  value during
the first 10  Policy  Years,  and 0.80%  thereafter,  and is  guaranteed  not to
increase  for the  duration  of a Policy.  AUL may  realize  a profit  from this
charge.                                                                         

The mortality risk assumed is that Insureds,  as a group, may live for a shorter
period of time than  estimated  and,  therefore,  the cost of insurance  charges
specified in the Policy will be insufficient to meet actual claims.  The expense
risk AUL assumes is that  expenses  incurred in issuing  and  administering  the
Policies and the  Separate  Account  will exceed the amounts  realized  from the
monthly administrative charges assessed against the Policies.                   

         Premium  Tax  Charge.  AUL  deducts a monthly  charge at an annual rate
equal to .25% of Account  Value  during the first 10 Policy  Years for state and
local premium  taxes and related  administrative  expenses.  The state and local
premium tax charge  reimburses AUL for premium taxes and related  administrative
expenses  associated with the Policies.  AUL expects to pay an average state and
local  premium  tax  rate  (including   related   administrative   expenses)  of
approximately  2.5% of premium payments for all states,  although such tax rates
range from 0% to 4%.  This  charge may be more or less than the amount  actually
assessed by the state in which a particular owner lives.                        

         Federal Tax Charge.  AUL also deducts a federal tax charge at an annual
rate equal to 0.15% of Account Value during the first 10 Policy Years.          

         Cost of Additional  Benefits Provided by Riders. The cost of additional
benefits   provided  by  riders  is  charged  to  the   Account   Value  on  the
Monthiversary.                                                                  

Annual Contract Charge                                                          

AUL deducts an annual  contract  charge from Account  Value equal to $30 on each
Policy Anniversary in which the Account Value is less than $50,000.  This charge
is deducted  prorata from each  Investment  Account to which you have  allocated
Account Value.                                                                  

Surrender Charge                                                                

During the first 10 Policy Years, a surrender  charge based on the percentage of
premium  surrendered  will be deducted  from the Account  Value if the Policy is
completely surrendered for cash, or if you make a Partial Surrender in excess of
12% of the first year  premium not  previously  withdrawn.  The total  surrender
charge will not exceed the maximum surrender charge set forth in your Policy.   

The surrender  charge on the date of  reinstatement of a Policy will be based on
the number of Policy  Years from the  original  Contract  Date.  For purposes of
determining the surrender charge on any date after reinstatement, the period the
Policy was lapsed will be credited to the total Policy period.

AUL does not  currently  assess a charge  for any  taxes  other  than the  state
premium tax charge and federal tax  charge.  We reserve the right,  however,  to
assess a charge for such taxes,  or taxes  resulting from the performance of the
Separate  Account,  against the Separate Account if we determine that such taxes
will be incurred.                                                               

Special Uses                                                                    

We may agree to reduce or waive the surrender  charge or the Monthly  Deduction,
or credit  additional  amounts  under the Policies in  situations  where selling
and/or  maintenance costs associated with the Policies are reduced,  such as the
sale of several Policies to the same Owner(s), sales of large Policies, sales of
Policies  in  connection   with  a  group  or  sponsored   arrangement  or  mass
transactions over multiple Policies.                                            

In addition, we may agree to reduce or waive some or all of these charges and/or
credit additional  amounts under the Policies for those Policies sold to persons
who meet  criteria  established  by us,  who may  include  current  and  retired
officers, directors and employees of us and our affiliates. We may also agree to
waive minimum premium requirements for such persons.                            

We will only reduce or waive such  charges or credit  additional  amounts on any
Policies  where  expenses  associated  with the sale of the Policy  and/or costs
associated with administering and maintaining the Policy are reduced. We reserve
the right to terminate waiver/reduced charge and crediting programs at any time,
including those for previously issued Policies.                                 

P-->49726th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
Fund Expenses                                                                   

Each  Investment  Account of the Separate  Account  purchases  shares at the net
asset value of the  corresponding  Portfolio.  The net asset value  reflects the
investment  advisory fee and other expenses that are deducted from the assets of
the  Portfolio.  The advisory fees and other expenses are not fixed or specified
under the terms of the Policy and are described in the Funds' prospectuses.     

HOW YOUR ACCOUNT VALUES VARY

There is no minimum  guaranteed  Account  Value,  Cash Value or Net Cash  Value.
These  values  will  vary  with  the  investment  experience  of the  Investment
Accounts,  and will depend on the allocation of Account  Value.  If the Net Cash
Value on a Monthiversary is less than the amount of the Monthly  Deduction to be
deducted on that date,  the Policy  will be in default  and a grace  period will
begin. See "Premium Payments to Prevent Lapse."

Determining the Account Value                                                   

         On the Contract Date, the Account Value is equal to the initial premium
less the Monthly Deductions  deducted as of the Contract Date. On each Valuation
Day thereafter, the Account Value is the aggregate of the Variable Account value
and the Loan Account value. Account Value may be significantly  affected on days
when the New York  Stock  Exchange  is open for  trading  but we are  closed for
business,  and you will not have access to Cash Value on those days. The Account
Value will vary to reflect the  performance of the Investment  Accounts to which
amounts have been allocated,  interest  credited on amounts in the Loan Account,
premium  payments since the prior Valuation Date,  charges,  transfers,  Partial
Surrenders and surrender  charges since the prior Valuation Date, loans and loan
repayments.                                                                     

         Variable  Account  Value.  When you allocate an amount to an Investment
Account,  either by premium  payment  allocation or by transfer,  your Policy is
credited  with  accumulation  units in that  Investment  Account.  The number of
accumulation  units  credited is determined by dividing the amount  allocated to
the Investment  Account by the Investment  Account's  accumulation unit value at
the end of the  Valuation  Period during which the  allocation is effected.  The
Variable  Account  value  of the  Policy  equals  the  sum,  for all  Investment
Accounts, of the accumulation units credited to an Investment Account multiplied
by that Investment Account's accumulation unit value.                           

The number of Investment Account accumulation units credited to your Policy will
increase when premium payments are allocated to the Investment  Account and when
amounts are  transferred  to the  Investment  Account.  The number of Investment
Account accumulation units credited to a Policy will decrease when the allocated
portion of the Monthly Deduction is taken from the Investment Account, a loan is
made,  an  amount  is  transferred  from the  Investment  Account,  or a Partial
Surrender is taken from the Investment Account.                                 

P-->49727th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
         Accumulation  Unit Values.  An Investment  Account's  accumulation unit
value is determined on each  Valuation Date and varies to reflect the investment
experience of the underlying Portfolio. It may increase, decrease, or remain the
same from Valuation Period to Valuation Period.  The accumulation unit value for
the  Money  Market  Investment   Account  was  initially  set  at  $1,  and  the
accumulation  unit  value  for  each  of  the  other  Investment   Accounts  was
arbitrarily set at $5 when each  Investment  Account was  established.  For each
Valuation Period after the date of establishment, the accumulation unit value is
determined by multiplying  the value of an  accumulation  unit for an Investment
Account  for the prior  Valuation  Period by the net  investment  factor for the
Investment Account for the current Valuation Period.                            

         Net Investment Factor. The net investment factor is used to measure the
investment performance of an Investment Account from one Valuation Period to the
next. For any  Investment  Account,  the net  investment  factor for a Valuation
Period is determined by dividing (a) by (b), where:                             

(a) is equal to:                                              
             1. the net  asset  value  per  share of the  Portfolio  held in the
             Investment  Account  determined at the end of the current Valuation
Period;  plus                                         
             2.  the  per  share   amount  of  any   dividend  or  capital  gain
             distribution  paid by the Portfolio  during the  Valuation  Period;
plus                                                  
             3. the per share  credit or charge with  respect to taxes,  if any,
             paid or reserved  for by AUL during the  Valuation  Period that are
             determined  by  AUL to be  attributable  to  the  operation  of the
Investment Account; and                               

(b) is equal to:                                              
             1. the net  asset  value  per  share of the  Portfolio  held in the
             Investment Account determined at the end of the preceding Valuation
Period; plus                                          
             2. the per share  credit or charge for any taxes  reserved  for the
immediately preceding Valuation Period.               

         Loan  Account  Value.  On any  Valuation  Date,  if there have been any
Policy loans, the Loan Account value is equal to amounts transferred to the Loan
Account from the Investment  Accounts as collateral for Policy loans and for due
and unpaid loan interest,  less amounts transferred from the Loan Account to the
Investment  Accounts as outstanding loans and loan interest are repaid, and plus
interest credited to the Loan Account.                                          

Cash Value and Net Cash Value                                                   

The Cash Value on a  Valuation  Date is the  Account  Value less any  applicable
surrender  charges.  The Net Cash  Value on a  Valuation  Date is the Cash Value
reduced by any  outstanding  loans and loan interest.  Net Cash Value is used to
determine  whether a grace  period  starts.  See  "Premium  Payments  to Prevent
Lapse." It is also the  amount  that is  available  upon full  surrender  of the
Policy. See "Surrendering the Policy for Net Cash Value."

 DEATH BENEFIT

As long as the Policy remains in force,  AUL will pay the Death Benefit Proceeds
upon receipt at the Home Office of  satisfactory  proof of the Insured's  death.
AUL may require return of the Policy.  The Death Benefit Proceeds may be paid in
a lump sum,  generally  within seven  calendar  days of receipt of  satisfactory
proof (see "When  Proceeds Are Paid"),  or in any other way agreeable to you and
us. Before the Insured dies,  you may choose how the proceeds are to be paid. If
you have not made a choice before the Insured dies, the  beneficiary  may choose
how the  proceeds  are paid.  The  Death  Benefit  Proceeds  will be paid to the
beneficiary. See "Selecting and Changing the Beneficiary."

Amount of Death Benefit Proceeds                                                

The Death Benefit Proceeds are equal to the sum of the Death Benefit in force as
of the end of the Valuation  Period  during which death  occurs,  plus any rider
benefits, minus any outstanding loan and loan interest on that date. If the date
of death occurs during a grace  period,  the Death Benefit will still be payable
to the  beneficiary,  although  the  amount  will be equal to the Death  Benefit
immediately  prior to the start of the grace period,  plus any benefits provided
by rider,  and less any  outstanding  loan and loan interest and overdue Monthly
Deductions as of the date of death. Under certain  circumstances,  the amount of
the Death Benefit may be further adjusted.  See "Limits on Rights to Contest the
Policy" and "Changes in the Policy or Benefits."                                

If part or all of the Death  Benefit  Proceeds is paid in one sum,  AUL will pay
interest on this sum if required  by  applicable  state law from the date of the
Insured's death to the date of payment.                                         

Death Benefit                                                                   

The Death Benefit is the greater of the Face Amount or the Applicable Percentage
(as described  below) of Account Value on the date of the  Insured's  death.  If
investment  performance  is  favorable,  the  amount  of the Death  Benefit  may
increase.  However,  the Death  Benefit  ordinarily  will not change for several
years to reflect any favorable investment performance and may not change at all.
To see how and when  investment  performance  may  begin  to  affect  the  Death
Benefit,  see "Illustrations of Account Values, Cash Values,  Death Benefits and
Accumulated Premium Payments."

Selecting and Changing the Beneficiary                                          

You select the  beneficiary  in your  application.  You may select more than one
beneficiary.  You may later change the  beneficiary in accordance with the terms
of the Policy. The primary  beneficiary,  or, if the primary  beneficiary is not
living, the contingent beneficiary,  is the person entitled to receive the Death
Benefit Proceeds under the Policy. If the Insured dies and there is no surviving
beneficiary,  the Owner (or the Owner's estate if the Owner is the Insured) will
be the  beneficiary.  If a beneficiary  is designated as  irrevocable,  then the
beneficiary's written consent must be obtained to change the beneficiary.       

 CASH BENEFITS

Policy Loans                                                                    

Prior to the  death of the  Insured,  you may  borrow  against  your  Policy  by
submitting  Proper  Notice to the Home  Office at any time  after the end of the
"right to  examine"  period  while the  Policy is not in the grace  period.  The
Policy is assigned to us as the sole security for the loan.  The minimum  amount
of a new loan is $500. The maximum amount of a new loan is:                     

1. 90% of the Variable Account value; less                    
2. any loan interest due on the next Policy Anniversary; less 
3. any applicable surrender charges; less                     
4. any existing loans and accrued loan interest.              

Outstanding  loans reduce the amount available for new loans.  Policy loans will
be processed as of the date your written request is received and approved.  Loan
proceeds  generally  will be sent to you within seven  calendar  days. See "When
Proceeds Are Paid."                                                             

         Interest. AUL will charge interest on any outstanding loan at an annual
rate of 6.0%.  Interest is due and payable on each  Policy  Anniversary  while a
loan is  outstanding.  If  interest  is not paid  when  due,  the  amount of the
interest is added to the loan and becomes part of the loan.                     

P-->49730th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
         Loan  Collateral.  When a Policy loan is made, an amount  sufficient to
secure the loan is transferred out of the Investment  Accounts into the Policy's
Loan Account.  Thus, a loan will have no immediate  effect on the Account Value,
but the Net Cash Value will be reduced  immediately by the amount transferred to
the Loan  Account.  The Owner can specify  the  Investment  Accounts  from which
collateral will be transferred.  If no allocation is specified,  collateral will
be transferred  from each  Investment  Account in the same  proportion  that the
Account  Value in each  Investment  Account  bears to the total Account Value in
those accounts on the date that the loan is made.  Due and unpaid  interest will
be transferred each Policy  Anniversary from each Investment Account to the Loan
Account in the same proportion  that each Investment  Account value bears to the
total unloaned Account Value. The amount we transfer will be the amount by which
the  interest  due  exceeds  the  interest  which has been  credited on the Loan
Account.                                                                        

The Loan Account will be credited with  interest at an effective  annual rate of
not less than 4.0%.  Thus,  the maximum net cost of a loan is 2.0% per year (the
net cost of a loan is the  difference  between the rate of  interest  charged on
outstanding  loans  and  loan  interests  and the  amount  credited  to the Loan
Account).  On each Monthiversary,  the interest earned on the Loan Account since
the previous Monthiversary will be transferred to the Loan Account.             

         Preferred  Loan  Provision.  A preferred  loan may be made available by
AUL.  The  amount  available  for a  preferred  loan is the  amount by which the
Account Value exceeds total premiums  paid.  The maximum amount  available for a
preferred loan may not exceed the maximum loan amount. The preferred loan amount
will be credited with an effective  annual rate of interest  (currently,  6.0%).
Thus,  the current net cost of the preferred  loan is 0% per year.  Any interest
credited in excess of the minimum guaranteed rate is not guaranteed.            

         Loan Repayment; Effect if Not Repaid. You may repay all or part of your
loan at any time while the  Insured  is living and the Policy is in force.  Loan
repayments  must be sent to the Home  Office and will be credited as of the date
received. A loan repayment must be clearly marked as "loan repayment" or it will
be  credited as a premium  unless the premium  would cause the Policy to fail to
meet the federal tax definition of a life insurance  contract in accordance with
the Internal  Revenue Code. When a loan repayment is made,  Account Value in the
Loan Account in an amount  equivalent to the repayment is  transferred  from the
Loan Account to the  Investment  Accounts.  Thus, a loan  repayment will have no
immediate  effect on the Account Value, but the Net Cash Value will be increased
immediately by the amount of the loan repayment.  Loan repayment amounts will be
transferred  to the  Investment  Accounts  according  to the premium  allocation
instructions in effect at that time.                                            

If  the  Death  Benefit  becomes  payable  while  a  loan  is  outstanding,  any
outstanding  loans and loan interest will be deducted in  calculating  the Death
Benefit Proceeds. See "Amount of Death Benefit Proceeds."                       

P-->49731st�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
If the Monthly  Deduction exceeds the Net Cash Value on any  Monthiversary,  the
Policy will be in default. You will be sent notice of the default. You will have
a grace  period  within  which  you may  submit a  sufficient  payment  to avoid
termination  of coverage  under the Policy.  The notice will  specify the amount
that must be repaid to prevent  termination.  See  "Premium  Payments to Prevent
Lapse."                                                                         

         Effect of Policy  Loan.  A loan,  whether  or not  repaid,  will have a
permanent  effect on the Death Benefit and Policy values  because the investment
results of the  Investment  Accounts of the Separate  Account will apply only to
the non-loaned portion of the Account Value. The longer the loan is outstanding,
the greater the effect is likely to be.  Depending on the investment  results of
the  Investment  Accounts  while the loan is  outstanding,  the effect  could be
favorable or  unfavorable.  Policy loans may increase the potential for lapse if
investment results of the Investment  Accounts are less than anticipated.  Also,
loans could,  particularly if not repaid, make it more likely than otherwise for
a Policy to  terminate.  Loans may be  currently  taxable  and  subject to a 10%
penalty tax. See "Tax  Considerations," for a discussion of the tax treatment of
Policy  loans,  and the adverse tax  consequences  if a Policy lapses with loans
outstanding.                                                                    

Surrendering the Policy for Net Cash Value                                      

You may  surrender  your Policy at any time for its Net Cash Value by submitting
Proper Notice to us. AUL may require  return of the Policy.  A surrender  charge
may apply. See "Surrender  Charge." A surrender  request will be processed as of
the date your written request and all required  documents are received.  Payment
will generally be made within seven calendar days. See "When Proceeds are Paid."
The Net Cash  Value  may be taken  in one  lump  sum or it may be  applied  to a
payment option. See "Settlement Options." The Policy will terminate and cease to
be in force if it is  surrendered  for one lump sum or applied  to a  settlement
option.  It  cannot  later  be  reinstated.  Surrenders  may  have  adverse  tax
consequences. See "Tax Considerations."

Partial Surrenders                                                              

You may make Partial  Surrenders  under your Policy of at least $500 at any time
after the end of the "right to examine"  period by  submitting  Proper Notice to
us. A Partial  Surrender  exceeding,  in any Policy Year, 12% of the total first
year premium not previously  withdrawn may be subject to a surrender charge. See
"Surrender  Charge." As of the date AUL receives a written request for a Partial
Surrender,  the Account Value and, therefore,  the Cash Value will be reduced by
the Partial Surrender.                                                          

When you request a Partial  Surrender,  you can direct how the Partial Surrender
will be deducted from the Investment Accounts. If you provide no directions, the
Partial  Surrender  will be deducted from your Account  Value in the  Investment
Accounts  on  a  prorata  basis.   Partial   Surrenders  may  have  adverse  tax
consequences. See "Tax Considerations."                                         

P-->49732nd�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
AUL will reduce the Face Amount in  proportion  to the  reduction in the Account
Value resulting from the Partial Surrender.  AUL will reject a Partial Surrender
request if the  Partial  Surrender  would  reduce the  Account  Value  below the
minimum Account Value on the Policy Data Page, or if the Partial Surrender would
cause  the  Policy  to  fail  to  qualify  as a life  insurance  contract  under
applicable tax laws, as interpreted by AUL.                                     

Partial Surrender requests will be processed as of the date your written request
is received,  and generally  will be paid within seven  calendar days. See "When
Proceeds Are Paid."

Settlement Options                                                              

At the time of  surrender  or  death,  the  Policy  offers  various  options  of
receiving  proceeds  payable  under the  Policy.  These  settlement  options are
summarized  below.  All of these  options are forms of  fixed-benefit  annuities
which do not vary with the  investment  performance of a separate  account.  Any
representative  authorized to sell this Policy can further explain these options
upon request.                                                                   

You may apply  proceeds of $2,000 or more which are payable under this Policy to
any of the following options:                                                   

         Option 1 - Income for a Fixed  Period.  Proceeds  are  payable in equal
monthly installments for a specified number of years, not to exceed 20.         

         Option  2  -  Life   Annuity.   Proceeds  are  paid  in  equal  monthly
installments  for as long as the  payee  lives.  A  number  of  payments  can be
guaranteed,  such as 120,  or the  number of  payments  required  to refund  the
proceeds applied.                                                               

         Option  3   -Survivorship   Annuity.   Proceeds  are  paid  in  monthly
installments  for as long as either the first payee or surviving  payee lives. A
number of payments equal to the initial payment can be guaranteed,  such as 120.
A different monthly installment payable to the surviving payee can be specified.
Any other  method or  frequency  of  payment  we agree to may be used to pay the
proceeds of this Policy.                                                        

Policy proceeds  payable in one sum will accumulate at interest from the date of
death or surrender  to the payment date at the rate of interest  then paid by us
or at the  rate  specified  by  statute,  whichever  is  greater.  Based  on the
settlement  option selected,  we will determine the amount payable.  The minimum
interest rate used in computing payments under all options will be 3% per year. 

You may  select  or  change an  option  by  giving  Proper  Notice  prior to the
settlement date. If no option is in effect on the settlement date, the payee may
select an option.  If this Policy is assigned or if the payee is a  corporation,
association,  partnership,  trustee  or  estate,  a  settlement  option  will be
available only with our consent.                                                

P-->49733rd�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
If a payee  dies  while a  settlement  option  is in  effect,  and  there  is no
surviving  payee,  we will pay a single sum to such  payee's  estate.  The final
payment will be the commuted value of any remaining guaranteed payments.        

Settlement  option  payments  will be exempt from the claims of creditors to the
maximum extent permitted by law.                                                

         Minimum Amounts.  AUL reserves the right to pay the total amount of the
Policy in one lump sum, if less than $2,000.  If monthly  payments are less than
$100, payments may be made less frequently at AUL's option.                     

The  proceeds of this  Policy may be paid in any other  method or  frequency  of
payment acceptable to us.                                                       

Specialized Uses of the Policy                                                  

Because the Policy provides for an accumulation of Cash Value as well as a Death
Benefit,  the Policy can be used for various  individual and business  financial
planning  purposes.  Purchasing  the  Policy in part for such  purposes  entails
certain risks. For example, if the investment performance of Investment Accounts
to which  Variable  Account  value is  allocated  is poorer than  expected or if
sufficient  premiums  are not paid,  the Policy may lapse or may not  accumulate
sufficient  Variable  Account value to fund the purpose for which the Policy was
purchased.  Partial Surrenders and Policy loans may significantly affect current
and future Account Value, Net Cash Value, or Death Benefit  Proceeds.  Depending
upon Investment Account investment  performance and the amount of a Policy loan,
the loan may cause a Policy to lapse.  Because the Policy is designed to provide
benefits on a long-term  basis,  before  purchasing  a Policy for a  specialized
purpose a purchaser  should consider  whether the long-term nature of the Policy
is consistent with the purpose for which it is being considered.  Using a Policy
for a specialized purpose may have tax consequences. See "Tax Considerations."

Life Insurance Retirement Plans                                                 

Any  Owners or  applicants  who wish to  consider  using the Policy as a funding
vehicle  for   (non-qualified)   retirement   purposes  may  obtain   additional
information  from us. An Owner could pay premiums under a Policy for a number of
years, and upon retirement, could utilize a Policy's loan and partial withdrawal
features to access  Account Value as a source of retirement  income for a period
of  time.  This  use of a  Policy  does  not  alter  an  Owner's  rights  or our
obligations  under a Policy;  the Policy would remain a life insurance  contract
that, so long as it remains in force,  provides for a Death Benefit payable when
the Insured dies.

Illustrations are available upon request that portray how the Policy can be used
as a funding mechanism for (non-qualified)  retirement plans, referred to herein
as "life insurance  retirement plans," for individuals.  Illustrations  provided
upon request  show the effect on Account  Value,  Cash Value,  and the net Death
Benefit of premiums paid under a Policy and partial  withdrawals and loans taken
for  retirement  income;  or  reflecting  allocation  of premiums  to  specified
Investment Accounts. This information will be portrayed at hypothetical rates of
return  that are  requested.  Charts and graphs  presenting  the  results of the
illustrations  or a comparison of retirement  strategies  will also be furnished
upon request.  Any graphic  presentations and retirement strategy charts must be
accompanied by a corresponding  illustration;  illustrations must always include
or be accompanied by comparable  information that is based on guaranteed cost of
insurance  rates and that  presents a  hypothetical  gross rate of return of 0%.
Retirement illustrations will not be furnished with a hypothetical gross rate of
return in excess of 12%.                                                        

The  hypothetical  rates of return in illustrations  are  illustrative  only and
should  not be  interpreted  as a  representation  of past or future  investment
results.  Policy  values  and  benefits  shown  in the  illustrations  would  be
different if the gross annual investment rates of return were different from the
hypothetical  rates  portrayed,  if premiums were not paid when due, and whether
loan interest was paid when due. Withdrawals or loans may have an adverse effect
on Policy benefits.                                                             

Risks of Life Insurance Retirement Plans                                        

Using your Policy as a funding vehicle for retirement  income purposes  presents
several risks,  including the risk that if your Policy is insufficiently  funded
in relation to the income  stream  expected  from your  Policy,  your Policy can
lapse  prematurely and result in significant  income tax liability to you in the
year in which the lapse occurs.  Other risks associated with borrowing from your
Policy  also  apply.  Loans will be  automatically  repaid  from the gross Death
Benefit at the death of the Insured,  resulting in the estimated  payment to the
beneficiary  of the net Death  Benefit,  which will be less than the gross Death
Benefit and may be less than the Face Amount.  Upon surrender,  the loan will be
automatically  repaid,  resulting  in the  payment to you of the Net Cash Value.
Similarly,  upon lapse,  the loan will be  automatically  repaid.  The automatic
repayment  of the loan upon lapse or  surrender  will cause the  recognition  of
taxable  income to the extent  that Net Cash Value plus the amount of the repaid
loan  exceeds  your basis in the  Policy.  Thus,  under  certain  circumstances,
surrender  or lapse of your  Policy  could  result in tax  liability  to you. In
addition,  to reinstate a lapsed  Policy,  you would be required to make certain
payments.  Thus,  you should be careful to fashion a life  insurance  retirement
plan so that  your  Policy  will not  lapse  prematurely  under  various  market
scenarios as a result of withdrawals and loans taken from your Policy.          

To avoid lapse of your Policy,  it is important to fashion a payment stream that
does not leave your Policy with  insufficient Net Cash Value.  Determinations as
to the amount to  withdraw or borrow each year  warrant  careful  consideration.
Careful  consideration  should also be given to any  assumptions  respecting the
hypothetical  rate of return,  to the duration of withdrawals and loans,  and to
the amount of Account Value that should remain in your Policy upon its maturity.
Poor  investment  performance  can  contribute  to the risk that your Policy may
lapse. In addition,  the cost of insurance  generally  increases with the age of
the Insured,  which can further erode  existing Net Cash Value and contribute to
the risk of lapse.                                                              

P-->49735th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
Further,  interest  on a  Policy  loan is due to us for any  Policy  Year on the
Policy  Anniversary.  If this  interest is not paid when due, it is added to the
amount of the  outstanding  loans and loan  interest,  and  interest  will begin
accruing thereon from that date. This can have a compounding  effect, and to the
extent that the outstanding  loan balance exceeds your basis in the Policy,  the
amounts  attributable  to interest due on the loans can add to your federal (and
possibly state) income tax liability.                                           

You should  consult  with your  financial  and tax  advisers in designing a life
insurance  retirement  plan that is suitable.  Further,  you should  continue to
monitor  the Net Cash Value  remaining  in a Policy to assure that the Policy is
sufficiently funded to continue to support the desired income stream and so that
it will not lapse. In this regard,  you should consult your periodic  statements
to determine the amount of their remaining Net Cash Value. Illustrations showing
the effect of charges under the Policy upon existing Account Value or the effect
of future withdrawals or loans upon the Policy's Account Value and Death Benefit
are  available  from  your   representative.   Consideration   should  be  given
periodically  to whether the Policy is  sufficiently  funded so that it will not
lapse prematurely.                                                              

Because of the potential risks  associated with borrowing from a Policy,  use of
the  Policy  in  connection  with a life  insurance  retirement  plan may not be
suitable  for all Owners.  These risks  should be  carefully  considered  before
borrowing from the Policy to provide an income stream.                          

ILLUSTRATIONS OF ACCOUNT VALUES, CASH VALUES, DEATH BENEFITS
AND ACCUMULATED PREMIUM PAYMENTS

The following tables have been prepared to illustrate hypothetically how certain
values under a Policy change with investment performance over an extended period
of time.  The  tables  illustrate  how  Account  Values,  Cash  Values and Death
Benefits  under a Policy  covering  an Insured of a given age on the Policy Date
would  vary over time if the  return on the  assets in each of the Funds were an
assumed  uniform  gross  annual  rate of 0%,  6% and 12%.  The  values  would be
different from those shown if the returns  averaged 0%, 6% or 12% but fluctuated
over and under those  averages  throughout  the years  shown.  The  hypothetical
investment  rates of return  are  illustrative  only and  should not be deemed a
representation of past or future  investment rates of return.  The tables may be
deemed to be "forward looking statements," and are based on certain assumptions.
Actual  performance  under the  Policy may differ  materially  from  performance
described in the tables.  Actual rates of return for a particular  Policy may be
more or less than the hypothetical investment rates of return and will depend on
a number of factors,  including  the  investment  allocations  made by an Owner.
These  illustrations  assume that  premiums are  allocated  equally among the 16
Investment Accounts available under the Policy.  These illustrations also assume
that no Policy loans have been made.                                            

P-->49736th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�36th
The illustrations  reflect the fact that the net investment return on the assets
held in the  Investment  Accounts is lower than the gross return of the selected
Portfolios.  The tables assume an average annual expense ratio of  approximately
0.76% of the  average  daily net assets of the  Portfolios  available  under the
Policies.  This average  annual  expense ratio is based on the expense ratios of
each of the Portfolios for the last fiscal year, adjusted,  as appropriate,  for
any  material  changes in expenses  effective  for the current  fiscal year of a
Portfolio. For information on the Portfolios' expenses, see the prospectuses for
the Funds and Portfolios.                                                       

The illustrations also reflect the deduction of the Monthly  Deduction.  AUL has
the  contractual  right to charge the guaranteed  maximum  charges.  The current
charges and,  alternatively,  the  guaranteed  charges are reflected in separate
illustrations  that follow.  All the illustrations  reflect the fact that no tax
charges  other than the premium tax charge and federal tax charge are  currently
made  against  the  Separate  Account and assume no  outstanding  loans and loan
interest or charges for rider benefits.                                         

The illustrations are based on AUL's sex distinct rates. Upon request,  an Owner
will be  furnished  with a  comparable  illustration  based  upon  the  proposed
Insured's  individual  circumstances.  Such  illustrations  may assume different
hypothetical rates of return than those illustrated in the following tables, and
also may reflect allocation of premiums to specified Investment  Accounts.  Such
illustrations  will  reflect  the  expenses  of the  Portfolios  in  which  such
Investment  Accounts  invest.  We may make a  reasonable  charge to provide such
illustrations.

OTHER POLICY BENEFITS AND PROVISIONS

Limits on Rights to Contest the Policy                                          

         Incontestability. In the absence of fraud, after the Policy has been in
force during the Insured's  lifetime for two years from the Contract  Date,  AUL
may not contest the Policy.                                                     

If a Policy lapses and it is reinstated,  we can contest the  reinstated  Policy
during the first two years after the effective  date of the  reinstatement,  but
only for statements made in the application for reinstatement.                  

         Suicide  Exclusion.  If the  Insured  dies by  suicide,  while  sane or
insane,  within  two years of the  Contract  Date or the  effective  date of any
reinstatement (or less if required by state law), the amount payable by AUL will
be equal to the  premiums  paid less any loan,  loan  interest,  and any partial
surrender.                                                                      

Changes in the Policy or Benefits                                               

         Misstatement  of Age or Sex. If it is determined  the age or sex of the
Insured as stated in the Policy is not  correct,  the Death  Benefit will be the
greater of: (1) the amount  which  would have been  purchased  at the  Insured's
correct age and sex by the most recent cost of insurance  charge  assessed prior
to the date we receive  proof of death;  or (2) the Account Value as of the date
we receive proof of death,  multiplied by the Minimum  Insurance  Percentage for
the correct age.                                                                

         Other Changes. Upon notice, AUL may modify the Policy, but only if such
modification is necessary to: (1) make the Policy or the Separate Account comply
with any applicable law or regulation  issued by a governmental  agency to which
AUL is  subject;  (2) assure  continued  qualification  of the Policy  under the
Internal  Revenue Code or other  federal or state laws relating to variable life
contracts; (3) reflect a change in the operation of the Separate Account; or (4)
provide different Separate Account or fixed account  accumulation  options.  AUL
reserves  the right to modify the Policy as  necessary to attempt to prevent the
Owner from being considered the owner of the assets of the Separate Account.  In
the event of any such modification, AUL will issue an appropriate endorsement to
the Policy,  if required.  AUL will  exercise  these rights in  accordance  with
applicable law, including approval of Owners, if required.                      

Any change of the Policy must be approved by AUL's President,  Vice President or
Secretary.  No  representative is authorized to change or waive any provision of
the Policy.                                                                     

P-->49747th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�47th
Exchange for Paid-Up Policy                                                     

You may exchange the Policy for a paid-up whole life policy by Proper Notice and
upon  returning  the Policy to the Home  Office.  The new policy will be for the
level face  amount,  not greater than the  Policy's  Face  Amount,  which can be
purchased by the Policy's Net Cash Value. The new policy will be purchased using
the  continuous  net single  premium for the  Insured's  age upon the  Insured's
nearest birthday at the time of the exchange.  We will pay you any remaining Net
Cash Value that was not used to purchase the new policy.                        

At any time after this option is elected,  the cash value of the new policy will
be its net single  premium at the  Insured's  then  attained age. All net single
premiums will be based on 3% interest and the guaranteed cost of insurance rates
of the Policy. No riders may be attached to the new policy.                     

When Proceeds Are Paid                                                          

AUL will  ordinarily  pay any Death Benefit  Proceeds,  loan  proceeds,  Partial
Surrender proceeds,  or Full Surrender proceeds within seven calendar days after
receipt at the Home  Office of all the  documents  required  for such a payment.
Other than the Death Benefit,  which is determined as of the date of death,  the
amount  will be  determined  as of the date of  receipt of  required  documents.
However,  AUL may delay making a payment or processing a transfer request if (1)
the New York  Stock  Exchange  is closed  for other  than a regular  holiday  or
weekend, trading is restricted by the SEC, or the SEC declares that an emergency
exists as a result of which the disposal or valuation of Separate Account assets
is not reasonably  practicable;  or (2) the SEC by order permits postponement of
payment to protect Owners.                                                      

Dividends                                                                       

You will receive any dividends declared by us as long as the Policy is in force.
Dividend  payments  will  be  applied  to  increase  the  Account  Value  in the
Investment  Accounts on a prorata basis unless you request cash  payment.  We do
not anticipate declaring any dividends.                                         

Reports to Policy Owners                                                        

At least  once a year,  you will be sent a report  at your  last  known  address
showing, as of the end of the current report period:  Account Value, Cash Value,
Death  Benefit,  change in value of amounts in the  Separate  Account,  premiums
paid, loans, Partial Surrenders, expenses charges, and cost of insurance charges
since the prior report.  You will also be sent an annual and a semiannual report
for each Fund or Portfolio  underlying an  Investment  Account to which you have
allocated  Account Value,  including a list of the securities held in each Fund,
as required by the 1940 Act. In addition,  when you pay premiums, or if you take
out a loan,  transfer amounts among the Investment  Accounts or take surrenders,
you will receive a written confirmation of these transactions.                  

P-->49748th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�48th
Assignment                                                                      

The Policy  may be  assigned  in  accordance  with its  terms.  In order for any
assignment  to be binding  upon AUL, it must be in writing and filed at the Home
Office.  Once AUL has  received a signed  copy of the  assignment,  the  Owner's
rights and the interest of any beneficiary (or any other person) will be subject
to the assignment. If there are any irrevocable  beneficiaries,  you must obtain
their consent before assigning the Policy. AUL assumes no responsibility for the
validity or sufficiency of any assignment.  An assignment is subject to any loan
on the Policy.                                                                  

Reinstatement                                                                   

The  Policy  may be  reinstated  within  five  years (or such  longer  period if
required  by  state  law)  after  lapse,  subject  to  compliance  with  certain
conditions,  including  the payment of a necessary  premium  and  submission  of
satisfactory evidence of insurability. See your Policy for further information. 

Rider Benefits                                                                  

The following  rider benefits are available and may be added to your Policy.  If
applicable,  monthly charges for these riders will be deducted from your Account
Value as part of the Monthly Deduction. All of these riders may not be available
in all states.                                                                  

Waiver of Monthly Deduction Disability (WMDD)                           
Issue Ages:     20-55                                                   

    This rider waives the Monthly Deduction, excluding the mortality and expense
    risk charge, during a period of total disability. WMDD cannot be attached to
    Policies  with Face  Amounts in excess of  $3,000,000  or rated  higher than
Table H.                                                                

    Monthly  Deductions  are waived for total  disability  following a six month
    waiting  period.  Monthly  Deductions  made during this  waiting  period are
    re-credited  to the  Account  Value  upon the actual  waiver of the  Monthly
    Deductions.  If disability  occurs  before age 60,  Monthly  Deductions  are
    waived as long as total disability  continues.  If disability occurs between
    ages 60-65,  Monthly  Deductions  are waived as long as the Insured  remains
totally disabled but not beyond age 65.                                 

Last Survivor Rider (LS)                                                
Issue Ages:     20-85                                                   

    This rider  modifies  the terms of the Policy to  provide  insurance  on the
    lives of two Insureds  rather than one.  When the LS Rider is attached,  the
    Death  Benefit  Proceeds are paid to the  beneficiary  upon the death of the
    last  surviving   Insured.   The  cost  of  insurance  charges  reflect  the
    anticipated  mortality  of the two  Insureds  and the fact  that  the  Death
    Benefit is not paid until the death of the surviving  Insured.  For a Policy
    containing the LS Rider to be reinstated, either both Insureds must be alive
    on the date of the reinstatement; or the surviving Insured must be alive and
    the  lapse   occurred   after  the   death  of  the   first   Insured.   The
    Incontestability,  Suicide, and Misstatement of Age or Sex provisions of the
Policy apply to either Insured.                                         

P-->49749th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�49th
    LS Rider also  provides a Policy  Split  Option,  allowing the Policy on two
    Insureds  to be split into two  separate  Policies,  one on the life of each
    Insured.  The LS Rider also  includes an Estate  Preservation  Benefit which
    increases the Face Amount of the Policy under certain conditions. The Estate
Preservation Benefit is only available to standard risks.               

Accelerated Death Benefit Rider (ABR)                                   

    This  rider  allows for a  prepayment  of a portion  of the  Policy's  Death
    Benefit while the Insured is still alive,  if the Insured has been diagnosed
    as  terminally  ill, and has 12 months or less to live.  The minimum  amount
    available  is $5,000.  The maximum  benefit  payable (in most states) is the
    lesser of $500,000 or 50% of the Face Amount. ABR may be added to the Policy
at any time while it is still in force. There is no charge for ABR.     

Your  determination as to how to purchase a desired level of insurance  coverage
should be based on specific insurance needs.  Consult your sales  representative
for further information.                                                        

Additional rules and limits apply to these rider benefits. Not all such benefits
may be  available  at any time,  and rider  benefits in addition to those listed
above may be made  available.  Please ask your AUL  representative  for  further
information, or contract the Home Office.                                       

TAX CONSIDERATIONS

The following  summary provides a general  description of the federal income tax
considerations associated with the Policy and does not purport to be complete or
to cover all situations.  This discussion is not intended as tax advice. Counsel
or  other   competent  tax  advisers  should  be  consulted  for  more  complete
information.  This discussion is based upon AUL's  understanding  of the present
federal tax laws as they  currently  are  interpreted  by the  Internal  Revenue
Service (the "IRS").                                                            

Tax Status of the Policy                                                        

In order to attain the tax benefits normally associated with life insurance, the
Policy must be classified  for federal  income tax purposes as a life  insurance
contract. Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code sets forth a definition of a
life  insurance  contract for federal  income tax  purposes.  The U.S.  Treasury
Department (the "Treasury") is authorized to prescribe regulations  implementing
Section 7702.  While proposed  regulations  and other interim  guidance has been
issued,  final regulations have not been adopted.  In short,  guidance as to how
Section 7702 is to be applied is limited.  If a Policy were determined not to be
a life  insurance  contract for purposes of Section 7702,  such Policy would not
provide the tax advantages normally provided by a life insurance contract.      

P-->49750th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�50th
With respect to a Policy  issued on a standard  basis,  AUL believes that such a
Policy  should meet the Section 7702  definition of a life  insurance  contract.
With respect to a Policy that is issued on a substandard  basis (i.e., a premium
class with extra rating involving higher than standard mortality risk), there is
less  guidance,  in  particular  as to  how  the  mortality  and  other  expense
requirements  of Section 7702 are to be applied,  in determining  whether such a
Policy meets the Section 7702  definition of a life insurance  contract.  If the
requirements  of Section 7702 were deemed not to have been met, the Policy would
not provide the tax benefits normally associated with life insurance and the tax
status of all contracts  invested in the  Investment  Account to which  premiums
were allocated under the non-qualifying contract might be affected.             

If it is  subsequently  determined  that a Policy does not satisfy Section 7702,
AUL may take whatever steps are  appropriate  and reasonable to attempt to cause
such a Policy to comply with Section 7702. For these  reasons,  AUL reserves the
right to modify  the  Policy it deems in its sole  discretion  as  necessary  to
attempt to qualify it as a life insurance contract under Section 7702.          

Section  817(h) of the Internal  Revenue Code requires that the  investments  of
each of the Investment  Accounts must be "adequately  diversified" in accordance
with Treasury regulations in order for the Policy to qualify as a life insurance
contract  under  Section  7702 of the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  The  Investment
Accounts,  through the  Portfolios,  intend to comply  with the  diversification
requirements  prescribed in Treas.  Reg. Section  1.817-5,  which affect how the
Portfolio's assets are to be invested. AUL believes that the Investment Accounts
will  meet the  diversification  requirements,  and AUL will  monitor  continued
compliance with this requirement.                                               

In certain  circumstances,  owners of variable life  insurance  contracts may be
considered  the owners,  for federal  income tax purposes,  of the assets of the
investment  accounts used to support their  contracts.  In those  circumstances,
income and gains from the  investment  account assets would be includable in the
variable contract owner's gross income.  The IRS has stated in published rulings
that a  variable  contract  owner  will be  considered  the owner of  investment
account assets if the contract owner  possesses  incidents of ownership in those
assets,  such as the ability to exercise investment control over the assets. The
Treasury has also  announced,  in  connection  with the issuance of  regulations
concerning  diversification,  that those  regulations  "do not provide  guidance
concerning the  circumstances  in which investor control of the investments of a
segregated asset account may cause the investor (i.e.,  the Owner),  rather than
the insurance company, to be treated as the owner of the assets in the account."
This  announcement  also  stated  that  guidance  would  be  issued  by  way  of
regulations or rulings on the "extent to which contract holders may direct their
investments to particular investment accounts without being treated as owners of
the underlying assets."                                                         

The  ownership  rights under the Policy are similar to, but different in certain
respects from,  those described by the IRS in rulings in which it was determined
that contract owners were not owners of investment  account assets. For example,
an Owner has additional  flexibility in allocating  premium payments and Account
Value.  These differences could result in an Owner being treated as the owner of
a prorata  portion of the assets of the Investment  Accounts.  In addition,  AUL
does not know what  standards will be set forth,  if any, in the  regulations or
rulings  which the  Treasury  has  stated it  expects  to issue.  AUL  therefore
reserves  the right to modify the Policy as  necessary  to attempt to prevent an
Owner from being  considered  the Owner of a prorata  share of the assets of the
Investment Accounts.                                                            

P-->49751st�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�51st
The  following  discussion  assumes  that  the  Policy  will  qualify  as a life
insurance contract for federal income tax purposes.                             

Tax Treatment of Policy Benefits                                                

         In General.  AUL believes that the proceeds and Account Value increases
of a Policy should be treated in a manner  consistent with a fixed-benefit  life
insurance  contract for federal  income tax  purposes.  Thus,  the Death Benefit
under the Policy should be excludable  from the gross income of the  beneficiary
under Section  101(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code.  However,  if you elect a
settlement option for a Death Benefit other than in a lump sum, a portion of the
payment made to you may be taxable.                                             

Depending  on the  circumstances,  the  exchange of a Policy,  a Policy  loan, a
Partial Surrender, a surrender,  a change in ownership,  or an assignment of the
Policy may have federal income tax consequences. In addition, federal, state and
local  transfer,  and other tax  consequences  of ownership or receipt of Policy
proceeds depends on the circumstances of each Owner or beneficiary.             

The  Policy  may also be used in various  arrangements,  including  nonqualified
deferred  compensation  or salary  continuation  plans,  split dollar  insurance
plans,  executive bonus plans, retiree medical benefit plans and others. The tax
consequences  of such  plans  may vary  depending  on the  particular  facts and
circumstances   of  each   individual   arrangement.   Therefore,   if  you  are
contemplating  the use of a Policy in any arrangement the value of which depends
in part on its tax  consequences,  you should  consult a  qualified  tax adviser
regarding the tax attributes of the particular arrangement.                     

Generally,  the Owner  will not be deemed to be in  constructive  receipt of the
Account Value, including increments thereof, until there is a distribution.  The
tax  consequences of  distributions  from, and loans taken from or secured by, a
Policy depend on whether the Policy is classified as a Modified Endowment.  Upon
a complete surrender or lapse of a Policy,  whether or not a Modified Endowment,
the excess of the amount  received plus the amount any of outstanding  loans and
loan interests over the total investment in the Policy will generally be treated
as ordinary income subject to tax.                                              

Modified  Endowments.   Section  7702A  establishes  a  class  of  life
insurance  Policies  designated  as "Modified  Endowment  Contracts."  The rules
relating  to  whether a Policy  will be  treated  as a  Modified  Endowment  are
extremely complex and cannot be adequately  described in the limited confines of
this  summary.  In  general,  a  Policy  will  be a  Modified  Endowment  if the
accumulated premiums paid at any time during the first seven Policy Years exceed
the sum of the net level  premiums  which would have been paid on or before such
time if the Policy  provided for paid-up  future  benefits  after the payment of
seven level annual premiums. A Policy may also become a Modified Endowment after
a material  change.  The  determination  of whether a Policy  will be a Modified
Endowment after a material change generally depends upon the relationship of the
Death  Benefit and Account  Value at the time of such change and the  additional
premiums paid in the seven years following the material change.                 

P-->49752nd�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�52nd
It is  expected  that most  Policies  will be  Modified  Endowments.  Due to the
Policy's flexibility,  classification as a Modified Endowment will depend on the
individual  circumstances of each Policy. In view of the foregoing, a current or
prospective  Owner  should  consult  with a tax adviser to  determine  whether a
Policy transaction will cause the Policy to be treated as a Modified Endowment. 

Policies  classified as Modified  Endowments  will be subject to the  following:
First, all  distributions,  including  distributions  upon surrender and Partial
Surrender,  from such a Policy are treated as ordinary  income subject to tax up
to the  amount  equal to the excess (if any) of the  Account  Value  immediately
before the distribution  over the investment in the Policy  (described below) at
such time. Second,  loans taken from or secured by such a Policy, are treated as
distributions from the Policy and taxed accordingly. Past due loan interest that
is added to the loan  amount  will be  treated  as a loan.  Third,  a 10 percent
additional  income tax is imposed on the portion of any  distribution  from,  or
loan taken from or secured by,  such a Policy that is included in income  except
where the distribution or loan is made on or after the Owner attains age 59 1/2,
is  attributable  to the Owner's  becoming  disabled,  or is part of a series of
substantially  equal periodic  payments for the life (or life expectancy) of the
Owner or the  joint  lives  (or joint  life  expectancies)  of the Owner and the
Owner's beneficiary.                                                            

If a Policy becomes a Modified Endowment after it is issued,  distributions made
during the Policy Year in which it becomes a Modified  Endowment,  distributions
in any  subsequent  Policy Year and  distributions  within two years  before the
Policy  becomes  a  Modified  Endowment  will be  subject  to the tax  treatment
described  above.  This means that a  distribution  from a Policy  that is not a
Modified  Endowment could later become taxable as a distribution from a Modified
Endowment.                                                                      

All Modified  Endowments  that are issued by AUL (or its affiliates) to the same
Owner  during any  calendar  year are  treated  as one  Modified  Endowment  for
purposes of determining  the amount  includable in an Owner's gross income under
Section 72(e) of the Internal Revenue Code.                                     

Distributions  from a Policy  that is not a  Modified  Endowment  are  generally
treated as first recovering the investment in the Policy  (described  below) and
then,  only  after  the  return  of  all  such  investment  in  the  Policy,  as
distributing  taxable  income.  An  exception to this general rule occurs in the
case of a  decrease  in the  Policy's  Death  Benefit or any other  change  that
reduces  benefits  under the  Policy in the first 15 years  after the  Policy is
issued  and that  results in a cash  distribution  to the Owner in order for the
Policy to continue complying with the Section 7702 definitional  limits.  Such a
cash  distribution  will be taxed in whole or in part as ordinary income (to the
extent of any gain in the Policy) under rules prescribed in Section 7702.       

P-->49753rd�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�53rd
Loans from,  or secured by, a Policy  that is not a Modified  Endowment  are not
treated as distributions. Instead, such loans are treated as indebtedness of the
Owner.                                                                          

Finally,  neither  distributions  (including  distributions  upon surrender) nor
loans from, or secured by, a Policy that is not a Modified Endowment are subject
to the 10 percent additional income tax.                                        

         Policy Loan  Interest.  Generally,  consumer  interest paid on any loan
under a Policy which is owned by an individual is not  deductible for federal or
state income tax  purposes.  The  deduction  of other forms of interest  paid on
Policy  loans may also be  subject  to other  restrictions  under  the  Internal
Revenue Code. A qualified tax adviser should be consulted  before  deducting any
Policy loan interest.                                                           

         Investment  in the  Policy.  Investment  in the Policy  means:  (i) the
aggregate amount of any premiums or other consideration paid for a Policy, minus
(ii) the aggregate amount received under the Policy which is excluded from gross
income of the Owner  (except that the amount of any loan from,  or secured by, a
Policy that is a Modified Endowment,  to the extent such amount is excluded from
gross income,  will be disregarded),  plus (iii) the amount of any loan from, or
secured by, a Policy that is a Modified Endowment to the extent that such amount
is included in the gross income of the Owner.                                   

Estate and Generation Skipping Taxes                                            

When the Insured dies,  the Death  Benefits will  generally be includable in the
Owner's  estate for  purposes  of federal  estate tax if the  Insured  owned the
Policy.  If the Owner was not the  Insured,  the fair market value of the Policy
would be included in the Owner's estate upon the Owner's death. Nothing would be
includable in the Insured's  estate if he or she neither  retained  incidents of
ownership at death nor had given up ownership within three years before death.  

Federal  estate tax is  integrated  with  federal  gift tax under a unified rate
schedule. An unlimited marital deduction may be available for federal estate and
gift tax purposes. The unlimited marital deduction permits the deferral of taxes
until the death of the  surviving  spouse  (when  the  Death  Benefits  would be
available to pay taxes due and other expenses incurred).                        

If the Owner  (whether or not he or she is the Insured)  transfers  ownership of
the Policy to someone  two or more  generations  younger,  the  transfer  may be
subject to the  generation-skipping  transfer tax with the taxable  amount being
the  value  of the  Policy.  The  generation-skipping  transfer  tax  provisions
generally  apply to transfers  which would be subject to the gift and estate tax
rules.  Because  these  rules are  complex,  the  Owner  should  consult  with a
qualified  tax adviser  for  specific  information  if  ownership  is passing to
younger generations.

Life Insurance Purchased for Use in Split Dollar Arrangements                   

On January 26, 1996, the IRS released a technical advice  memorandum  ("TAM") on
the  taxability  of  life  insurance  policies  used  in  certain  split  dollar
arrangements.  A TAM, issued by the National Office of the IRS,  provides advice
as to the internal revenue laws, regulations,  and related statutes with respect
to a specific  set of facts and a specific  taxpayer.  In the TAM,  among  other
things,  the IRS concluded  that an employee was subject to current  taxation on
the excess of the cash  surrender  value of the policy  over the  premiums to be
returned to the employer.  Purchasers of life  insurance  policies to be used in
split dollar  arrangements  are strongly advised to consult with a qualified tax
adviser to determine the tax treatment resulting from such an arrangement.      

Non-Individual Ownership of Contracts                                           

If the  Owner  of a Policy  is an  entity  rather  than an  individual,  the tax
treatment may differ from that described above. Accordingly,  prospective Owners
that are entities should consult a qualified tax advisor.                       

Possible Charge for AUL's Taxes                                                 

At the present time,  AUL makes no charge for any federal,  state or local taxes
(other than the  premium tax charge and federal tax charge)  that it incurs that
may be attributable to the Investment Accounts or to the Policies.  However, AUL
reserves the right to make additional charges for any such tax or other economic
burden  resulting from the  application of the tax laws that it determines to be
properly attributable to the Investment Accounts or to the Policies.            

OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE POLICIES AND AUL

Policy Termination                                                              

The Policy will terminate, and insurance coverage will cease, as of: (1) the end
of the Valuation  Period during which we receive  Proper Notice to surrender the
Policy;  (2) the expiration of a grace period;  or (3) the death of the Insured.
See  "Surrendering  the Policy for Net Cash Value." "Premium Payments to Prevent
Lapse," and "Death Benefit."

Resolving Material Conflicts                                                    

The Funds presently serve as the investment medium for the Separate Account and,
therefore,  indirectly for the Policies. In addition,  the Funds have advised us
that they are available to registered separate accounts of insurance  companies,
other than AUL, offering variable annuity and variable life insurance policies. 

P-->49755th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�55th
We do not currently  foresee any  disadvantages  to you resulting from the Funds
selling  shares as an  investment  medium for products  other than the Policies.
However, there is a theoretical possibility that a material conflict of interest
may arise between Owners whose Cash Values are allocated to the Separate Account
and the  owners  of  variable  life  insurance  policies  and  variable  annuity
contracts  issued by other  companies  whose values are allocated to one or more
other separate accounts investing in any one of the Funds. Shares of some of the
Funds  may  also be sold to  certain  qualified  pension  and  retirement  plans
qualifying under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, there is
a possibility that a material conflict may arise between the interests of Owners
or owners of other contracts  (including  contracts issued by other  companies),
and such retirement plans or participants in such retirement plans. In the event
of a material conflict, we will take any necessary steps, including removing the
Separate  Account  from  that  Fund,  to  resolve  the  matter.   The  Board  of
Directors/Trustees  of each Fund will  monitor  events in order to identify  any
material  conflicts that may arise and determine what action,  if any, should be
taken in response to those events or conflicts.                                 

Addition, Deletion or Substitution of Investments                               

We reserve the right, subject to applicable law, to make additions to, deletions
from, or  substitutions  for the shares that are held in the Separate Account or
that the  Separate  Account may  purchase.  If the shares of a Portfolio  are no
longer  available for investment or if, in our judgment,  further  investment in
any  Portfolio  should  become  inappropriate  in  view of the  purposes  of the
Separate  Account,  we may redeem the  shares,  if any,  of that  Portfolio  and
substitute shares of another registered open-end management  investment company.
We will not  substitute  any shares  attributable  to a Policy's  interest in an
Investment  Account  of the  Separate  Account  without  notice to you and prior
approval of the SEC and state insurance  authorities,  to the extent required by
the 1940 Act or other applicable law.                                           

We also reserve the right to  establish  additional  Investment  Accounts of the
Separate  Account,  each of which  would  invest  in shares  corresponding  to a
Portfolio  of a Fund  or in  shares  of  another  investment  company  having  a
specified  investment  objective.  Any  new  Investment  Accounts  may  be  made
available  to existing  Owners on a basis to be  determined  by AUL.  Subject to
applicable  law and any required SEC approval,  we may, in our sole  discretion,
eliminate one or more Investment Accounts if marketing needs, tax considerations
or investment conditions warrant.                                               

If any of these  substitutions  or  changes  are made,  we may,  by  appropriate
endorsement, change the Policy to reflect the substitution or change.           

If we deem it to be in the best  interests of persons having voting rights under
the Policies  (subject to any approvals  that may be required  under  applicable
law), the Separate  Account may be operated as a management  investment  company
under the 1940 Act, it may be deregistered  under that Act if registration is no
longer required, or it may be combined with other AUL separate accounts.        

P-->49756th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�56th
Voting Rights                                                                   

AUL is the legal owner of the shares of the  Portfolios  held by the  Investment
Accounts  of the  Separate  Account.  In  accordance  with its  view of  present
applicable  law, AUL will exercise  voting rights  attributable to the shares of
each  Portfolio  held in the  Investment  Accounts  at any  regular  and special
meetings of the  shareholders  of the Funds or Portfolios  on matters  requiring
shareholder  voting under the 1940 Act. AUL will  exercise  these voting  rights
based on  instructions  received  from  persons  having the voting  interest  in
corresponding  Investment  Accounts of the Separate  Account and consistent with
any requirements  imposed on AUL under contracts with any of the Funds, or under
applicable law. However, if the 1940 Act or any regulations thereunder should be
amended, or if the present interpretation thereof should change, and as a result
AUL determines  that it is permitted to vote the shares of the Portfolios in its
own right, it may elect to do so.                                               

The person having the voting  interest  under a Policy is the Owner.  AUL or the
pertinent  Fund shall send to each Owner a Fund's proxy  materials  and forms of
instruction  by  means  of  which  instructions  may be  given  to AUL on how to
exercise voting rights attributable to the Portfolio's shares.                  

Unless otherwise  required by applicable law or under a contract with any of the
Funds, with respect to each of the Portfolios, the number of Portfolio shares as
to which voting  instructions  may be given to AUL is determined by dividing the
value of all of the Accumulation  Units of the corresponding  Investment Account
attributable  to a Policy on a particular  date by the net asset value per share
of that  Portfolio as of the same date.  Fractional  votes will be counted.  The
number of votes as to which voting  instructions may be given will be determined
as of the date  coincident  with the date  established by a Fund for determining
shareholders  eligible  to vote at the  meeting  of the  Fund or  Portfolio.  If
required by the SEC or under a contract with any of the Funds,  AUL reserves the
right to determine in a different fashion the voting rights  attributable to the
shares of the Portfolio. Voting instructions may be cast in person or by proxy. 

Voting  rights   attributable  to  the  Policies  for  which  no  timely  voting
instructions  are received  will be voted by AUL in the same  proportion  as the
voting  instructions  which are  received  in a timely  manner for all  Policies
participating in that Investment Account. AUL will vote shares of any Investment
Account, if any, that it owns beneficially in its own discretion, except that if
a Fund offers its shares to any insurance  company  separate  account that funds
variable  annuity  contracts  or if  otherwise  required  by  applicable  law or
contract,  AUL will vote its own  shares in the same  proportion  as the  voting
instructions  that are received in timely manner for Policies  participating  in
the Investment Account.                                                         

P-->49757th�Page�of�91TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�57th
Neither  the  Separate  Account  nor AUL is under any duty to  inquire as to the
instructions  received  or the  authority  of Owners or others to  instruct  the
voting of shares of any of the Portfolios.                                      

If  required  by state  insurance  officials,  AUL may  disregard  Owner  voting
instructions  if such  instructions  would  require  shares to be voted so as to
cause a change in  sub-classification or investment objectives of one or more of
the Portfolios, or to approve or disapprove an investment advisory agreement. In
addition, AUL may under certain circumstances disregard voting instructions that
would require changes in the investment  advisory contract or investment adviser
of one or more of the  Portfolios,  provided that AUL reasonably  disapproves of
such changes in accordance  with  applicable  federal  regulations.  If AUL ever
disregards voting instructions, Owners will be advised of that action and of the
reasons for such action in the next semiannual report. Finally, AUL reserves the
right to  modify  the  manner in which  the  weight to be given to  pass-through
voting instructions is calculated when such a change is necessary to comply with
current federal regulations or the current interpretation thereof.              

Sale of the Policies                                                            

The Policies will be offered to the public on a continuous  basis, and we do not
anticipate  discontinuing the offering of the Policies.  However, we reserve the
right to discontinue  the offering.  Applications  for Policies are solicited by
representatives  who are licensed by applicable  state insurance  authorities to
sell our variable life contracts and who are also registered  representatives of
AUL. AUL is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as
a  broker-dealer  and is a member  of the  National  Association  of  Securities
Dealers, Inc.                                                                   

AUL acts as the  "principal  underwriter,"  as defined  in the 1940 Act,  of the
Policies for the  Separate  Account.  We are not  obligated to sell any specific
number of Policies.                                                             

Registered  representatives  may be paid  commissions  on  Policies  they  sell.
Representatives   will   generally   be   paid  4%  of  the   initial   premium.
Representatives  will  generally be paid 4% of the initial  premium.  Additional
commissions may be paid in certain circumstances. Other allowances and overrides
also may be paid.                                                               

AUL Directors and Executive Officers                                            

The  following  table sets forth the name and principal  occupations  during the
past  five  years of each of AUL's  directors  and  executive  officers.  Unless
otherwise  indicated,  the address of each of the following  individuals  is One
American  Square,  P.O.  Box  368,  Indianapolis,  Indiana 46206-0368,  and the

AUL is subject to  regulation  by the  Department  of  Insurance of the State of
Indiana,  which periodically  examines the financial condition and operations of

has been filed with and, where  required,  approved by,  insurance  officials in
those jurisdictions where it is sold.

AUL is required to submit annual statements of operations,  including  financial
statements,  to the insurance  departments of the various jurisdictions where it
does business to determine  solvency and compliance  with  applicable  insurance
laws and regulations.                                                           

Additional Information                                                          

A  registration  statement  under the Securities Act of 1933 has been filed with
the SEC relating to the offering  described in this Prospectus.  This Prospectus
does not include all the  information set forth in the  registration  statement.
The  omitted  information  may be  obtained  at the  SEC's  principal  office in
Washington, D.C. by paying the SEC's prescribed fees.                           

Independent Auditors                                                            

The  consolidated  balance  sheets for AUL at December  31, 1996 and the related
consolidated  statements of income,  stockholders' equity and cash flows for the
year ended  December 31, 1996,  appearing  herein have been audited by Coopers &
Lybrand  LLP,  independent  auditors,  as set  forth  in  their  report  thereon
appearing elsewhere herein, and are included herein in reliance upon such report
given upon the authority of such firm as experts in accounting and auditing.    

Actuarial  matters  included in this prospectus have been examined by Stephen J.
Pearson,  FSA, MAAA, Assistant Vice President and Individual Product Actuary, of
AUL.                                                                            

Litigation                                                                      

The Separate Account is not a party to any litigation. Its depositor, AUL, as an
insurance company,  ordinarily is involved in litigation.  AUL is of the opinion
that, at present, such litigation is not material to the Owners of the Policies.

Legal Matters                                                                   

Dechert  Price & Rhoads of  Washington,  D.C.  has  provided  advice on  certain
matters  relating  to the  federal  securities  laws.  Matters  of  Indiana  law
pertaining to the Policies,  including AUL's right to issue the Policies and its
qualification to do so under applicable laws and regulations  issued thereunder,
have been passed upon by Richard A. Wacker, Associate General Counsel, of AUL.  

Financial Statements                                                            

AUL's  financial  statements as of December 31, 1996 for the year ended December
31,  1996 and as of June 30, 1997 for the six month  period  ended June 30, 1997
are  included in this  Prospectus.  The  financial  statements  of AUL should be
distinguished  from financial  statements of the Separate  Account and should be
considered only as bearing upon AUL's ability to meet its obligations  under the
Policies. They should not be considered as bearing on the investment performance
of the assets held in the Separate Account. Because the Separate Account had not
commenced operations before the date of this Prospectus, no financial statements
of the Separate Account are included in this Prospectus.

 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors                                                       
American United Life Insurance Company                                          
Indianapolis, Indiana                                                           

We have audited the accompanying  combined balance sheet of American United Life
Insurance  Company(R)  and  affiliates as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the
related combined statements of operations,  policyowners' surplus and cash flows
for the years then ended.  These financial  statements are the responsibility of
the Company's  management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.                                       

We  conducted  our  audits  in  accordance  with  generally   accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.          

In our opinion,  the combined  financial  statements  referred to above  present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of American United Life
Insurance  Company(R)  and  affiliates as of December 31, 1996 and 1995, and the
results  of their  operations  and their  cash flows for the years then ended in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.                       

As discussed in Note I to the combined financial statements, the Company adopted
Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 120 (SFAS 120) and  Financial
Accounting  Standards  Board  Interpretation  No.  40 (FIN  40)  which  required
implementation of several accounting  pronouncements not previously adopted. The
effects  of  adopting  SFAS  120 and FIN 40 were  retroactively  applied  to the
Company's   previously   issued  financial   statements,   consistent  with  the
implementation guidance of those standards.                                     

The Company previously issued financial statements for 1995 which were presented
in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  prescribed  or  permitted  by  the
Insurance Department of the State of Indiana and which were considered generally
accepted  accounting   principles  for  mutual  life  insurance  companies.   We
previously  issued  our  report  dated  February  19,  1996,  on such  financial
statements.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                              
Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation                                  
American United Life Insurance Company(R) (AUL) is an  Indiana-domiciled  mutual
life insurance company with headquarters in Indianapolis.  AUL is licensed to do
business in 47 states and the District of Columbia.  AUL offers  individual life
insurance  and  annuities,  group  life and  disability  insurance  and  pension
products  through  career agents  working in a  distribution  network of general
agency offices.  AUL also offers  reinsurance  services.  The combined financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its affiliate, The State Life
Insurance Company (State Life). Significant intercompany  transactions have been
excluded.                                                                       

The  accompanying  financial  statements  have been prepared in accordance  with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles  (GAAP).  As of January 1, 1996, AUL
adopted  Financial   Accounting   Standards  Board  (FASB)  Statement  No.  120,
Accounting and Reporting by Mutual Life Insurance  Enterprises  and by Insurance
Enterprises for Certain  Long-Duration  Participating  Contracts,  and Financial
Accounting  Standards Board  Interpretation  No. 40 (FIN40),  'Applicability  of
Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles  for Mutual Life Insurance and Other
Enterprises.'  SFAS120 requires financial statements prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting  principles to apply all applicable  authoritative
GAAP  pronouncements.  The cumulative  effect of applying SFAS No. 120 primarily
consists of the initial  deferral of acquisition  costs,  the  establishment  of
deferred  taxes,  the  change  in  methodology  for  insurance   reserves,   the
elimination  of  the  statutory  asset  valuation  reserve  and  the  effect  of
classifying certain fixed maturity investments as available for sale. The effect
of the  changes  has been  reported  retroactively  through  restatement  of the
financial  information  as of January 1, 1994. As a result of restating the 1995
financial  statements,  combined net income was increased by $1.4  million,  and
combined policyowners' surplus increased $239.8 million.                        

AUL also files financial statements with insurance regulatory  authorities which
are  prepared  on  the  basis  of  statutory   accounting  practices  which  are
significantly  different from financial  statements  prepared in accordance with
GAAP.  These  differences  are  described  in  detail  in  Note  9  -  Statutory
Information.                                                                    

The preparation of financial  statements in conformity  with generally  accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities  at the date of the
financial  statements,  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.         

INVESTMENTS                                                                     
Fixed maturity securities which may be sold to meet liquidity and other needs of
the Company are  categorized as available for sale and are stated at fair value.
Fixed maturity  securities which the Company has the positive intent and ability
to hold to  maturity  are  categorized  as  held-to-maturity  and are  stated at
amortized cost.  Equity  securities are stated at fair value.  Mortgage loans on
real estate are  carried at  amortized  cost less an  impairment  allowance  for
estimated uncollectible amounts. Real estate is reported at cost less allowances
for  depreciation.  Depreciation is provided  (straight line) over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets. Investment real estate is net of accumulated
depreciation  of $28.8  million and $28.3 million at December 31, 1996 and 1995,
respectively.  Depreciation  expense for investment real estate amounted to $2.4
million  and $2.6  million  for 1996 and 1995,  respectively.  Policy  loans are
carried at their unpaid balance. Other invested assets are reported at cost plus
the Company's equity in undistributed net equity since  acquisition.  Short term
investments  include  investments  with  maturities  of one-year or less and are
carried at cost which  approximates  market.  Short term certificates of deposit
and savings  certificates  are considered to be cash  equivalents.  The carrying
amount for cash and cash equivalents approximates market.

Realized  gains and losses on sale or  maturity  of  investments  are based upon
specific  identification  of the  investments  sold and do not  include  amounts
allocable to separate accounts.  At the time a decline in value of an investment
is determined to be other than temporary, a provision for loss is recorded which
is included  in  realized  investment  gains and  losses.  Unrealized  gains and
losses, resulting from carrying available-for-sale securities at fair value, are
reported in policyowners' surplus, net of deferred income taxes.                

DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS                                               
Those costs of acquiring new business, which vary with and are primarily related
to the  production of new  business,  have been deferred to the extent that such
costs are deemed recoverable.  Such costs include commissions,  certain costs of
policy underwriting and issue and certain variable agency expenses.  These costs
are amortized with interest as follows:                                         

For participating whole life insurance products,  over the lesser of 30 years or
the lifetime of the policy in relation to the present  value of estimated  gross
margins from expenses, investments and mortality,  discounted using the expected
investment yield.                                                               

For universal  life-type policies and investment  contracts,  over the lesser of
the  lifetime of the policy or 30 years for life  policies or 20 years for other
policies in  relation  to the present  value of  estimated  gross  profits  from
surrender  charges and  investment,  mortality and expense  margins,  discounted
using the interest rate credited to the policy.                                 

For term life insurance products and life reinsurance policies,  over the lesser
of the benefit period or 30 years for term life or 20 years for life reinsurance
policies in relation to the ratio of anticipated  annual premium  revenue to the
anticipated   total  premium  revenue,   using  the  same  assumptions  used  in
calculating policy benefits.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)                                       

For miscellaneous group life and individual and group health policies,  straight
line over the expected life of the policy.                                      

For  credit  insurance  policies,  the  deferred  acquisition  cost  balance  is
primarily  equal to the  unearned  premium  reserve  multiplied  by the ratio of
deferrable commissions to premiums written.                                     

Recoverability of the unamortized  balance of deferred policy  acquisition costs
is evaluated regularly. For universal life-type contracts,  investment contracts
and participating whole life policies, the accumulated  amortization is adjusted
(increased or decreased)  whenever  there is a material  change in the estimated
gross profits or gross margins  expected over the life of a block of business in
order to maintain a constant  relationship  between cumulative  amortization and
the present value of gross profits or gross margins.  For most other  contracts,
the  unamortized  asset  balance is reduced by a charge to income  only when the
present  value of future  cash  flows,  net of the  policy  liabilities,  is not
sufficient to cover such asset balance.                                         

ASSETS HELD IN SEPARATE ACCOUNTS                                                
Separate  accounts  are  funds on which  investment  income  and gains or losses
accrue directly to certain  policyholders,  primarily variable annuity contracts
and equity-based  pension and profit sharing plans. The assets of these accounts
are legally  segregated,  and are valued at fair value. The related  liabilities
are recorded at amounts equal to the underlying  assets; the fair value of these
liabilities is equal to their carrying amount.                                  

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT                                                          
Property and  equipment  includes real estate owned and occupied by the Company.
Property and equipment is carried at cost,  net of accumulated  depreciation  of
$35.9 million and $30.1 million as of December 31, 1996 and 1995,  respectively.
The Company  provides  for  depreciation  of property  and  equipment  using the
straight-line  method over its estimated useful life.  Depreciation  expense for
1996 and 1995 was $6.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively.                  

PREMIUM REVENUE AND BENEFITS TO POLICYHOLDERS                                   
The premiums and benefits for whole life and term insurance products and certain
annuities  with  life   contingencies   (immediate   annuities)  are  fixed  and
guaranteed.  Such  premiums are  recognized as premium  revenue when due.  Group
insurance  premiums are  recognized  as premium  revenue over the time period to
which the premiums  relate.  Benefits and  expenses are  associated  with earned
premiums  so as to  result  in  recognition  of  profits  over  the  life of the
contracts.  This  association  is  accomplished  by means of the  provision  for
liabilities for future policy  benefits and the  amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs.                                                              

Universal  life policies and  investment  contracts are policies with terms that
are not fixed and guaranteed. The terms that may be changed could include one or
more of the amounts assessed the policyholder, premiums paid by the policyholder
or  interest  accrued to  policyholder  balances.  The  amounts  collected  from
policyholders  for  these  policies  are  considered  deposits,   and  only  the
deductions during the period for cost of insurance,  policy  administration  and
surrenders are included in revenue.  Policy benefits and claims that are charged
to expense include interest credited to contracts and benefit claims incurred in
the period in excess of related policy account balances.

RESERVES FOR FUTURE POLICY AND CONTRACT BENEFITS                                
Liabilities for future policy benefits for participating whole life policies are
calculated using the net level premium method and assumptions as to interest and
mortality.  The  interest  rate  is the  dividend  fund  interest  rate  and the
mortality rates are those guaranteed in the calculation of cash surrender values
described in the contract.  Liabilities for future policy benefits for term life
insurance  and life  reinsurance  policies  are  calculated  using the net level
premium  method  and  assumptions  as  to  investment   yields,   mortality  and
withdrawals.  The  assumptions  are based on projections of past  experience and
include  provisions for possible  unfavorable  deviation.  These assumptions are
made at the time the contract is issued.  Liabilities for future policy benefits
on universal life and investment contracts consist principally of policy account
values plus  certain  deferred  policy fees which are  amortized  using the same
assumptions and factors used to amortize the cost of policies  produced.  If the
future benefits on investment contracts are guaranteed (immediate annuities with
benefits paid for a period  certain) the  liability  for future  benefits is the
present value of such guaranteed benefits.  Claim liabilities include provisions
for reported  claims and estimates  based on historical  experience,  for claims
incurred but not reported.                                                      

INCOME TAXES                                                                    
The provision for income taxes includes amounts  currently  payable and deferred
income  taxes  resulting  from  the  temporary  differences  in the  assets  and
liabilities determined on a tax and financial reporting basis.

    Active employees fully eligible to retire                                
      and receive benefits                          2.6                  2.4

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


The assumed  discount rate used in determining the accumulated  postretire- ment
benefit was 7.25% and the assumed  health care cost trend rate was 10% graded to
6% over 50 years.  Compensation  rates were  assumed to increase 6% at each year
end.  The health  coverage  for  retirees  and 65 and over is capped in the year
2000.  The health care cost trend rate  assumption  has an effect on the amounts
reported.  An  increase  in the  assumed  health  care cost  trend  rates by one
percentage   point  would  increase  the  accumulated   postretirement   benefit
obligation  as of December 31, 1996 by $178,000  and  increase  the  accumulated
postretirement benefit cost for 1996 by $77,000.

Federal  income  taxes paid were $39.0  million  and $18.2  million for 1996 and
1995, respectively.                                                             

6.  Reinsurance:                                                                

The Company is a party to various reinsurance  contracts under which it receives
premiums as a reinsurer and reimburses the ceding  companies for portions of the
claims  incurred.  At December 31, 1996 and 1995, life  reinsurance  assumed was
approximately 67% and 65%, respectively, of life insurance in force.            

The Company cedes that portion of the total risk on an individual life in excess
of $1,000,000.  For accident and health and disability policies, the Company has
established  various  limits of coverage it will retain on any one policy  owner
and cedes the remainder of such coverage.                                       

Certain statistical data with respect to reinsurance follows:                   

                                                                [Download Table]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Net premiums                                    458.1                458.2 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Reinsurance recoveries                        $  73.5             $   77.3 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Company  accounts for all  reinsurance  agreements  as transfers of risk. If
companies  to which  reinsurance  has been ceded are unable to meet  obligations
under  the  reinsurance  agreements,  the  Company  would  remain  liable.  Five
reinsurers  account for  approximately  64% of the  Company's  December 31, 1996
ceded reserves for life and accident and health insurance. The remainder of such
ceded reserves is spread among numerous reinsurers.                             

7. Surplus Notes and Lines of Credit:                                           

On February 16, 1996, the Company issued $75 million of Surplus Notes, due March
30, 2026.  Interest is payable  semi-annually on March 30, and September 30 at a
7.75% annual  rate.  Any payment of interest on or principal of the Notes may be
made only with the prior approval of the Commissioner of the Indiana  Department
of Insurance.  The Surplus Notes may not be redeemed at the option of AUL or any
holder of the Surplus  Notes.  Interest paid during 1996 was $3.6  million.  The
Company has available a $125 million committed credit facility.  No amounts have
been drawn as of December 31, 1996.                                             

8. Commitments and Contingencies:                                               

Various  lawsuits have arisen in the ordinary course of the Company's  business.
In each of the matters,  the Company  believes the ultimate  resolution  of such
litigation  will not result in any  material  adverse  impact to  operations  or
financial condition of the Company.

The  Company  and  its  affiliate,   State  Life,  prepare  statutory  financial
statements in accordance with accounting  principles and practices prescribed or
permitted  by  the  Indiana  Department  of  Insurance.   Prescribed   statutory
accounting practices (SAP) currently include state laws, regulations and general
administrative  rules  applicable  to all insurance  enterprises  domiciled in a
particular  state,  as well as practices  described in National  Association  of
Insurance Commissioners'(NAIC) publications.

Life insurance  companies are required to maintain  certain amounts of assets on
deposit with state regulatory authorities. Such assets had an aggregate carrying
value of $4.5 million at December 31, 1996.

10. Fair Value of Financial Instruments:                                        

The disclosure of fair value  information  about certain  financial  instruments
based  primarily  on  quoted  market  prices.  The  fair  values  of  short-term
investments  and accrued  investment  income  approximate  the carrying  amounts
reported in the balance  sheets.  Fair values for fixed  maturity set and equity
securities, and surplus notes are based on quoted market prices where available.
For fixed  maturity  securities not actively  traded,  fair values are estimated
using values  obtained  from  independent  pricing  services,  or in the case of
private  placements,  are estimated by  discounting  expected  future cash flows
using a current market rate applicable to the yield, credit quality and maturity
of the investments.                                                             

The fair  value of the  aggregate  mortgage  loan  portfolio  was  estimated  by
discounting  the future cash flows using  current  rates at which  similar loans
would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings for similar maturities.  

The estimated fair values of the liabilities for policyholder  funds approximate
the  statement  values  because  interest  rates  credited  to account  balances
approximate  current rates paid on similar  funds are not  generally  guaranteed
beyond one year. Fair values for other insurance reserves are not required to be
disclosed.  However, the estimated fair values for all insurance liabilities are
taken into  consideration in the Company's  overall  management of interest rate
risk, which minimizes  exposure to changing  interest rates through the matching
of investment  maturities with amounts due under insurance  contracts.  The fair
values of certain financial instruments along with their corresponding  carrying
values at December 31, 1996 and 1995 follows.

PROSPECTUS    
AUL AMERICAN INDIVIDUAL VARIABLE LIFE UNIT TRUST  
FLEXIBLE PREMIUM ADJUSTABLE VARIABLE LIFE INSURANCE POLICY  
 AMERICAN UNITED LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY(R)
ONE AMERICAN SQUARE, P.O. BOX 7127, INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA 46206-7127 
(800) 537-6442 - WWW.AUL.COM 

This Prospectus describes a flexible premium adjustable variable life insurance 
policy (the "Policy") offered by American United Life Insurance Company(R)      
("AUL," "we," "us" or "our") subject to approval in individual states. AUL      
designed the Policy to provide insurance protection on the Insured (or Insureds 
if you choose the Last Survivor Rider) named in the Policy. The Policy also     
provides you with the flexibility to vary the amount and timing of premium      
payments and to change the amount of death benefits payable under the Policy.   
This flexibility allows you to provide for your changing insurance needs under a
single insurance Policy.  You also have the opportunity to allocate Net Premiums
and Account Value to one or more Investment Accounts of the AUL American        
Individual Variable Life Unit Trust (the "Separate Account") and to AUL's       
general account (the "Fixed Account"), within limits. This Prospectus generally 
describes only that portion of the Account Value allocated to the Separate      
Account. For a brief summary of the Fixed Account, see "Fixed Account." AUL     
invests the assets of each Investment Account in a corresponding mutual fund    
portfolio (each, a "Portfolio"). Each Investment Account invests exclusively in 
shares of one of the following Mutual Fund Portfolios:

SUMMARY OF THE POLICY 

The investor should read the following summary of Prospectus information and    
diagram of the policy in conjunction with the detailed information appearing    
elsewhere in this Prospectus.  Unless otherwise indicated, the description of   
the Policy in this Prospectus assumes that the Policy is in force, that the Last
Survivor Rider is not in force, and that there are no outstanding loans and loan
interest.                                                                       

The Policy is similar in many ways to fixed-benefit life insurance. As with     
fixed-benefit life insurance, typically the Owner of a Policy pays premium      
payments for insurance coverage on the Insured. Also, like fixed-benefit life   
insurance, the Policy provides for accumulation of Net Premiums and a Net Cash  
Value that is payable if the Owner surrenders the Policy during the Insured's   
lifetime. As with fixed-benefit life insurance, the Net Cash Value during the   
early Policy Years is likely to be lower than the premium payments paid.        

However, the Policy differs from fixed-benefit life insurance in several        
important respects. Unlike fixed-benefit life insurance, the Death Benefit may  
and the Account Value will increase or decrease to reflect the investment       
performance of the Investment Accounts to which Account Value is allocated.     
Also, there is no guaranteed minimum Net Cash Value. Nonetheless, AUL guarantees
to keep the Policy in force during the Guarantee Period shown on the Policy Data
Page of your Policy if, on each Monthiversary, the sum of the premiums paid to  
date, less any Partial Surrenders, loans and loan interest, equals or exceeds   
the Required Premium for the Guarantee Period (shown on the Policy Data Page of 
your Policy) multiplied by the number of Policy Months since the Policy Date.   
Otherwise, if the Net Cash Value is insufficient to pay the Monthly Deduction,  
the Policy will lapse without value after a grace period. See "Premium Payments
to Prevent Lapse." If a Policy lapses while loans are outstanding, adverse tax  
consequences may result. See "Tax Considerations."
CONTRACT BENEFITS. Cash benefits available under a Contract include loans for up
to 90% of the Account Value; partial surrenders, provided there is sufficient   
Net Cash Value; the ability to surrender the contract in full at any time for   
its Net Cash Value less loan interest due on the next Policy Anniversary and any
surrender charges.                                                              

Death benefits include benefit payable to the beneficiary income tax free,      
available as a lump sum or under a variety of settlement options, either equal  
to the Face Amount, or equal to the Face Amount plus Account Value; flexibility 
to change the death benefit option and face amount.                             

CONTRACT RISKS. AUL intends for the Policy to satisfy the definition of a life  
insurance policy under Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as    
amended (the "Internal Revenue Code"). Under certain circumstances, the Internal
Revenue Code will treat a Policy as a Modified Endowment.  AUL will monitor the 
Policies and will attempt to notify you on a timely basis if your Policy ceases 
to satisfy the federal tax definition of life insurance or becomes a Modified   
Endowment.  However, we do not undertake to give you such notice or to take     
corrective action. We reserve the right to refund any premiums that may cause   
the Policy to become a Modified Endowment. For further discussion of the tax    
status of a Policy and the tax consequences of being treated as a life insurance
contract or a Modified Endowment, see "Tax Considerations."                     

Insufficient premium payments, poor investment performance, withdrawals, and    
unpaid loans of loan interest may cause your policy to lapse, endangering       
insurance coverage. There is no guarantee that your policy will not lapse even  
if you pay your planned premium. You should review your coverage with your      
registered representative on a regular basis.                                   

Withdrawal charges on full surrenders may inhibit your ability to access your   
cash value. Furthermore, making a withdrawal or taking a loan may change your   
policy's face amount and/or death benefit, reducing the death benefit proceeds  
payable to your beneficiary. Withdrawals and loans may make your policy more

PORTFOLIO COMPANY RISKS. Each Investment Option invests in a corresponding      
mutual fund portfolio. The value of each portfolio fluctuates with the value of 
the investments that it holds. Returns are not guaranteed. You bear the         
investment risk of any Investment Option that you choose. A comprehensive       
discussion of the risks of each mutual fund portfolio may be found in the mutual
fund's prospectus.                                                              

PURPOSE OF THE POLICY. AUL designed the Policy to provide long-term insurance   
benefits; and, it may also provide long-term accumulation of Cash Value. You    
should evaluate the Policy in conjunction with other insurance policies that you
own, as well as the need for insurance and the Policy's long-term potential for 
growth. It may not be advantageous to replace existing insurance coverage with  
this Policy.                                                                    

RIGHT TO EXAMINE POLICY AND POLICY EXCHANGE. For a limited time, you have the   
right to cancel your Policy and receive a refund. See "Right to Examine Policy."
AUL generally allocates Net Premiums to the Fixed Account and Investment        
Accounts on the later of the day the "right to examine" period expires, or the  
date we receive the premium at our Home Office. See "Premium Allocations and
Crediting."                                                                     

You may exchange the Policy for a paid-up whole life policy with a level face   
amount, not greater than the Policy's Face Amount, that can be purchased by the 
Policy's Net Cash Value.  See "Exchange for Paid-Up Policy."                    

OWNER INQUIRIES. If you have any questions, you may write or call our Home      
Office.

rates are used where appropriate under applicable law, including in the 
state of Montana, and in Policies purchased by employers and employee   
organizations in connection with employment-related insurance or benefit
  programs. The cost of insurance rate generally increases with the Attained

charge to reflect the mortality of the two insureds under the contract.

 GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT AUL, THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT AND THE FUNDS

AMERICAN UNITED LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY(R) 
American United Life Insurance Company(R) ("AUL") has its principal offices at  
One American Square, Indianapolis, Indiana, 46282. AUL is a stock insurance     
company existing under the laws of the State of Indiana. It was originally      
incorporated as a fraternal society on November 7, 1877, under the laws of the  
federal government, and reincorporated as a mutual insurance company under the  
laws of the State of Indiana in 1933. On December 17, 2000, AUL converted from a
mutual life insurance company to a stock life insurance company ultimately      
controlled by a mutual holding company, American United Mutual Insurance Holding
Company ("MHC").                                                                

After conversion, the insurance company issued voting stock to a newly-formed   
stock holding company, OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. (the "Stock Holding  
Company"). The Stock Holding Company may, at some future time, offer shares of  
its stock publicly or privately; however, the MHC must always hold at least 51% 
of the voting stock of the Stock Holding Company, which in turn owns 100% of the
voting stock of AUL.  No plans have been formulated to issue any shares of      
capital stock of the Stock Holding Company at this time. The Stock Holding      
Company issued $200 million aggregate principal amount of its 7% senior notes   
due 2033 in 2003.                                                               

AUL conducts a conventional life insurance and annuity business. At December 31,
2004, the OneAmerica Financial Partners, Inc. enterprise, in which AUL is a     
partner, had assets of $15,028.0 million and had equity of $1,182.3 million.    

The principal underwriter for the Contracts is OneAmerica Securities, Inc., a   
wholly owned subsidiary of AUL. OneAmerica Securities, Inc. is registered as a  
broker-dealer with the SEC.                                                     

SEPARATE ACCOUNT 

The Separate Account was established as a segregated investment account under   
Indiana law on July 10, 1997. It is used to support the Policies and may be used
to support other variable life insurance contracts, and for other purposes      
permitted by law.  The Separate Account is registered with the Securities and   
Exchange Commission ("SEC") as a unit investment trust under the Investment     
Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"). AUL has established other segregated      
investment accounts, some of which also are registered with the SEC.

Account are not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business of
AUL. AUL is obligated to pay all benefits provided under the Policies.

industries within the sector. The Portfolio invests in companies that may be    
responsible for breakthrough products or technologies or may be positioned to   
take advantage of cutting edge developments. The Portfolio's holdings may range 
from smaller companies developing new technologies or pursuing scientific       
breakthroughs to large, blue chip firms with established track records in       
developing, using or marketing scientific advances.

PIONEER FUND VCT PORTFOLIO. Seeking reasonable income and capital growth. The   
Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio invests in a broad list of carefully selected,       
reasonably priced securities rather than in securities whose prices reflect a   
premium resulting from their current market popularity. The portfolio invests   
the major portion of its assets in equity securities, primarily of U.S. issuers.
The portfolio's investment adviser uses a value approach to select the          
portfolio's investments, and also considers a security's potential to provide a 
reasonable amount of income.

PIONEER GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES VCT PORTFOLIO. Seeking capital growth. The Pioneer 
Growth Opportunities VCT Portfolio manager employs bottom up, fundamental       
research in the pursuit of rapidly growing companies. The buy discipline is     
primarily focused on small company stocks that are attractively priced on a     
valuation basis using both qualitative and quantitative screens. Most issues    
have excellent earnings growth potential, but are trading at discounts relative 
to their industry peers and the overall market. The manager will sell when      
outlook changes; however, the manager may keep holdings through periodic        
downturns.

T. ROWE PRICE EQUITY SERIES, INC. 
(INVESTMENT ADVISOR - T. ROWE PRICE ASSOCIATES, INC.)                           

T. ROWE PRICE BLUE CHIP GROWTH PORTFOLIO. Seeking to provide long-term growth of
capital by investing primarily in the common stocks of large- and medium-sized  
blue chip companies with the potential for above-average growth. Fund Managers  
carefully select companies which are well-established in their respective       
industries, and which possess some or all of the following characteristics:     
leading market positions; seasoned management teams; and strong financial       
fundamentals. The Fund may invest up to 20% of its total assets in foreign      
securities.                                                                     

T. ROWE PRICE EQUITY INCOME PORTFOLIO. Seeking to provide a relatively          
conservative way to access substantial dividend income and long-term capital    
growth. The fund manager of the T. Rowe Price Equity Income Fund invests in     
common stocks of established companies expected to pay above-average dividends. 
The fund manager employs a value-oriented investment approach. He focuses on    
companies with an above-average dividend yield - a positive component of total  
return. The manager utilizes a thorough "bottom-up" fundamental research        
evaluation of each holding. Also, the manager will broadly diversify sector     
exposure seeking to reduce volatility.                                          

T. ROWE PRICE MID-CAP GROWTH PORTFOLIO. Seeking long-term capital appreciation  
through investments in mid-cap stocks with potential for above-average earnings 
growth. The Fund will normally invest at least 80% of net assets in a           
diversified portfolio of common stocks of mid-cap companies whose earnings T.   
Rowe Price expects to grow at a faster rate than the average company. Mid-Cap   
companies are defined as those whose market capitalization falls within the     
range of either the S&P Mid Cap 400 Index or the Russell Midcap Growth Index. In
selecting investments, management generally favors companies that have proven   
products or services; have a record of above-average earnings growth; have      
demonstrated potential to sustain earnings growth; operate in industries        
experiencing increasing demand; or have stock prices that appear to undervalue  
their growth prospects. While most of the assets will be invested in U.S. common
stocks, the portfolio may hold other securities including foreign securities,   
futures and options in keeping with the Portfolio's objective. Effective May 1,
2004, this Portfolio will not be available to new contracts.

T. ROWE PRICE LIMITED-TERM BOND PORTFOLIO. Seeking high level of income         
consistent with moderate fluctuations in principal value. The Fund normally     
invests at least 80% of its net assets in bonds and 65% of total assets in      
short- and intermediate-term bonds. There are no maturity limitations on        
individual securities but the Fund's dollar-weighted average effective maturity 
will not exceed five years. At least 90% of the Fund's Portfolio will consist of
investment-grade securities. In an effort to enhance yield, up to 10% of assets 
can be invested in below-investment-grade securities.

Additional Information for each Fund or Portfolio. The prospectuses for the

concerning the allocation of Net Premium payments or transfers among the

AUL has entered into agreements with the Distributors/Advisors of AIM Variable  
Insurance Funds, Alger American Fund, American Century(R) Variable Portfolios,  
Inc., Calvert Variable Series, Inc., Dreyfus Investment Portfolios, Dreyfus     
Variable Investment Fund, Fidelity(R) Variable Insurance Products Freedom Funds,
Fidelity(R) Variable Insurance Products Funds, Janus Aspen Series, Liberty Ridge
Capital, Inc., Neuberger Berman , Pioneer Investment Management, Inc., T. Rowe  
Price Equity Series, Inc., T. Rowe Price Fixed Income Series, Inc., The Timothy 
Plan(R) and The Vanguard Group, Inc., under which AUL has agreed to render      
certain services and to provide information about these Funds to Owners who     
invest in these Funds. Under these agreements and for providing these services, 
AUL receives compensation from the Distributor/ Advisor of these Funds, (or from
the Funds if a 12b-1 plan has been approved) ranging from zero basis points     
until a certain level of Fund assets have been purchased to 25 basis points on  
the net average aggregate deposits made.                                        

AUL cannot guarantee that each Fund or Portfolio will always be available for   
the Policies; but, in the event that a Fund or Portfolio is not available, AUL  
will take reasonable steps to secure the availability of a comparable fund.     
Shares of each Portfolio are purchased and redeemed at net asset value, without 
a sales charge.                                                                 

VOTING RIGHTS 

AUL is the legal owner of the shares of the Portfolios held by the Investment   
Accounts of the Separate Account. In accordance with its view of present        
applicable law, AUL will exercise voting rights attributable to the shares of   
each Portfolio held in the Investment Accounts at regular and special meetings  
of the shareholders of the Funds or Portfolios on matters requiring shareholder 
voting under the 1940 Act. AUL will exercise these voting rights based on       
instructions received from persons having the voting interest in corresponding  
Investment Accounts of the Separate Account and consistent with any requirements
imposed on AUL under contracts with any of the Funds, or under applicable law.  
However, if the Investment Company Act of 1940 or any regulations thereunder    
should be amended, or if the present interpretation thereof should change, and  
as a result AUL determines that it is permitted to vote the shares of the       
Portfolios in its own right, it may elect to do so.                             

The person having the voting interest under a Policy is the Owner. AUL or the   
pertinent Fund shall send to each Owner a Fund's proxy materials and forms of   
instruction by means of which instructions may be given to AUL on how to        
exercise voting rights attributable to the Portfolio's shares.                  

Unless otherwise required by applicable law or under a contract with any of the 
Funds, with respect to each of the Portfolios, the number of Portfolio shares as
to which voting instructions may be given to AUL is determined by dividing the  
value of all of the Accumulation Units of the corresponding Investment Account  
attributable to a Policy on a particular date by the net asset value per share  
of that Portfolio as of the same date. Fractional votes will be counted. The    
number of votes as to which voting instructions may be given will be determined 
as of the date coincident with the date established by a Fund for determining   
shareholders eligible to vote at the meeting of the Fund or Portfolio. If       
required by the SEC or under a contract with any of the Funds, AUL reserves the 
right to determine in a different fashion the voting rights attributable to the 
shares of the Portfolio. Voting instructions may be cast in person or by proxy. 

Voting rights attributable to the Policies for which no timely voting           
instructions are received will be voted by AUL in the same proportion as the    
voting instructions which are received in a timely manner for all Policies      
participating in that Investment Account. AUL will vote shares of any Investment
Account, if any, that it owns beneficially in its own discretion, except that if
a Fund offers its shares to any insurance company separate account that funds   
variable annuity contracts or if otherwise required by applicable law or        
contract, AUL will vote its own shares in the same proportion as the voting     
instructions that are received in timely manner for Policies participating in   
the Investment Account.                                                         

Neither the Separate Account nor AUL is under any duty to inquire as to the     
instructions received or the authority of Owners or others to instruct the      
voting of shares of any of the Portfolios.                                      

If required by state insurance officials, AUL may disregard Owner voting        
instructions if such instructions would require shares to be voted so as to     
cause a change in sub-classification or investment objectives of one or more of 
the Portfolios, or to approve or disapprove an investment advisory agreement. In
addition, AUL may under certain circumstances disregard voting instructions that
would require changes in the

investment advisory contract or investment advisor of one or more of the        
Portfolios, provided that AUL reasonably disapproves of such changes in         
accordance with applicable federal regulations. If AUL ever disregards voting   
instructions, Owners will be advised of that action and of the reasons for such 
action in the next semiannual report. Finally, AUL reserves the right to modify 
the manner in which the weight to be given to pass-through voting instructions  
is calculated when such a change is necessary to comply with current federal    
regulations or the current interpretation thereof.                              

PREMIUM PAYMENTS AND ALLOCATIONS

APPLYING FOR A POLICY 

AUL requires satisfactory evidence of the proposed Insured's insurability, which
may include a medical examination of the proposed Insured. The available Issue  
Ages are 0 through 85 on a standard basis, and 20 through 85 on a preferred non-
tobacco user and tobacco user basis. Issue Age is determined based on the       
Insured's age as of the Contract Date. Acceptance of an application depends on  
AUL's underwriting rules, and AUL reserves the right to reject an application.  
Coverage under the Policy is effective as of the later of the date the initial  
premium is paid or the Issue Date.                                              

As the Owner of the Policy, you may exercise all rights provided under the      
Policy while the Insured is living, subject to the interests of any assignee or 
irrevocable beneficiary. The Insured is the Owner, unless a different Owner is  
named in the application. In accordance with the terms of the Policy, the Owner 
may in the application or by Proper Notice name a contingent Owner or a new     
Owner while the Insured is living. The Policy may be jointly owned by more than 
one Owner. The consent of all joint Owners is required for all transactions     
except when proper forms have been executed to allow one Owner to make changes. 
Unless a contingent Owner has been named, on the death of the last surviving    
Owner, ownership of the Policy passes to the estate of the last surviving Owner,
which then will become the Owner. A change in Owner may have tax consequences.  
See "Tax Considerations."

RIGHT TO EXAMINE PERIOD 

You may cancel your Policy for a refund during your "right to examine" period.  
This period expires 10 calendar days after you receive your Policy (or a longer 
period if required by law). If you decide to cancel the Policy, you must return 
it by mail or other delivery method to the Home Office or to the authorized AUL 
representative who sold it. Immediately after mailing or delivery of the Policy 
to AUL, the Policy will be deemed void from the beginning. Within seven calendar
days after AUL receives the returned Policy, AUL will refund the greater of     
premiums paid or the Account Value.                                             

PREMIUMS 

The minimum initial premium payment required depends on a number of factors,    
such as the Age, sex and risk class of the proposed Insured, the initial Face   
Amount, any supplemental and/or rider benefits and the planned premium payments 
you propose to make. Consult your AUL representative for information about the  
initial premium required for the coverage you desire.                           

The initial premium is due on or before delivery of the Policy. There will be   
no coverage until this premium is paid or until the Issue Date, whichever is    
later.                                                                          

You may make other premium payments at any time and in any amount, subject to   
the limits described in this section. The actual amount of premium payments will
affect the Account Value and the period of time the Policy remains in force.    

Premium payments after the initial payment must be made to our Home Office. Each
payment must be at least equal to the minimum payment shown on the Policy Data  
Page in your Policy. All premiums combined may not be more than $1,000,000,     
unless a higher amount is agreed to by us.                                      

The planned premium is the amount for which we will bill you or, in the case of 
our automatic premium plan (which deducts the planned premium from your checking
account), the amount for which we will charge your account. The amount and      
frequency of the planned premium are shown on the Policy Data Page in your      
Policy. You may change the amount and the frequency of the planned premium by   
Proper Notice. We reserve the right to change the planned premium to comply     
with our rules for billing amount and frequency.                                

Unless otherwise indicated, premiums received in excess of planned premium will 
be applied as additional premium.                                               

If the payment of any premium would cause an increase in Risk Amount because of 
the Minimum Insurance Percentage, we may require satisfactory evidence of       
insurability before accepting it. If we accept the premium, we will allocate the
Net Premium to your Account Value on the date of our acceptance. If we do not   
accept the premium, we will refund it to you.                                   

If the payment of any premium would cause this Policy to fail to meet the       
federal tax definition of a life insurance contract in accordance with the      
Internal Revenue Code, we reserve the right to refund the amount to you with    
interest no later than 60 days after the end of the Policy Year when we receive 
the premium, but we assume no obligation to do so.                              

If the payment of any premium would cause the Policy to become a Modified       
Endowment, we will attempt to so notify you upon allocating the premium, but we 
assume no obligation to do so. In the event that we notify you, consistent with 
the terms of the notice you may choose whether you want the premium refunded to 
you. We reserve the right to refund any premiums that cause the Policy to become
a Modified Endowment. Upon request, we will refund the premium, with interest,  
to you no later than 60 days after the end of the Policy Year in which we       
receive the premium.                                                            

PLANNED PREMIUMS. When applying for a Policy, you may select a plan for paying  
level premium payments semi-annually or annually. If you elect, AUL will also   
arrange for payment of planned premiums on a monthly basis under a              
pre-authorized payment arrangement. You are not required to pay premium payments
in accordance with these plans; rather, you can pay                             

18

P-->49719th�"Page"�of�58TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�19th
more or less than planned, or skip a planned premium entirely. (See, however,   
"Premium Payments to Prevent Lapse" and "Guarantee Period and Required Premium
for the Guarantee Period." Each premium after the initial premium must be at    
least $50. AUL may increase this minimum 90 days after we send you a written    
notice of such increase. Subject to the limits described above, you can change  
the amount and frequency of planned premiums whenever you want by sending Proper
Notice to the Home Office. However, AUL reserves the right to limit the amount  
of a premium payment or the total premium payments paid.                        

PREMIUM PAYMENTS TO PREVENT LAPSE 

Failure to pay planned premiums will not necessarily cause a Policy to lapse.   
Conversely, paying all planned premiums will not guarantee that a Policy will   
not lapse. The conditions that will result in your Policy lapsing will vary     
depending on whether a Guarantee Period is in effect, as follows:               

GRACE PERIOD. The Policy goes into default at the start of the grace period,    
which is a period to make a premium payment sufficient to prevent lapse. A Grace
Period starts if the Net Cash Value on a Monthiversary will not cover the       
Monthly Deduction. AUL will send notice of the grace period and the amount      
required to be paid during the grace period to your last known address. The     
grace period shall terminate as of the date indicated in the notice, which shall
comply with any applicable state law. Your Policy will remain in force during   
the grace period. If the Insured should die during the grace period, the Death  
Benefit proceeds will still be payable to the beneficiary, although the amount  
paid will be equal to the Death Benefit immediately prior to the start of the   
grace period, plus any benefits provided by rider, and less any outstanding loan
and loan interest and overdue Monthly Deductions and mortality and expense risk 
charges as of the date of death. See "Amount of Death Benefit Proceeds." If the 
grace period premium payment has not been paid before the grace period ends,    
your Policy will lapse. It will have no value, and no benefits will be payable. 
See "Reinstatement."                                                            

A grace period also may begin if any outstanding loan and loan interest becomes 
excessive. See "Policy Loans."

GUARANTEE PERIOD AND REQUIRED PREMIUM FOR THE GUARANTEE PERIOD. The Guarantee   
Period is the period shown in the Policy during which the Policy will remain in 
force and will not begin the grace period, if on each Monthiversary, the sum of 
the premiums paid to date, less any Partial Surrenders, loans and loan interest,
equals or exceeds the Required Premium for the Guarantee Period multiplied by   
the number of Policy Months since the Contract Date. If this test fails on any  
Monthiversary, the continuation of insurance guarantee terminates. The guarantee
will not be reinstated.                                                         

The Required Premium for the Guarantee Period is shown on the Policy Data Page. 
If you make changes to the Policy after issue, the Required Premium for         
subsequent months may change. We will send you notice of the new Required       
Premium. The Required Premium per $1,000 factors for the Face Amount vary by    
risk class, Issue Age, and sex. Additional premiums for substandard ratings and 
rider benefits are included in the Required Premium.                            

AFTER THE GUARANTEE PERIOD. A grace period starts if the Net Cash Value on a    
Monthiversary will not cover the Monthly Deduction. A premium sufficient to keep
the Contract in force must be submitted during the grace period.                

PREMIUM ALLOCATIONS AND CREDITING 

On the Investment Option Election Form, you specify the percentage of a Net     
Premium to be allocated to the Investment Accounts and to the Fixed Account. The
sum of your allocations must equal 100%, with at least 1% of the Net Premium    
payment allocated to each account selected by you. All Net Premium allocations  
must be in whole percentages. AUL reserves the right to limit the number of     
Investment Accounts to which premiums may be allocated. You can change the      
allocation percentages at any time, subject to these rules, by sending Proper   
Notice to the Home Office, by telephone if written authorization is on file with
us or by using the Internet. The change will apply to the premium payments      
received with or after receipt of your notice.                                  

The initial Net Premium generally is allocated to the Fixed Account and the     
Investment Accounts in accordance with your allocation instructions on the later
of the day the "right to examine" period expires, or the date we receive the    
premium at our Home Office. Subsequent Net Premiums are allocated as of the end 
of the Valuation Period during which we receive the premium at our Home Office. 

We generally allocate all Net Premiums received prior to the Issue Date to our  
general account prior to the end of the "right to examine" period. We will      
credit interest daily on Net Premiums so allocated. However, we reserve the     
right to allocate Net Premiums to the Fixed Account and the Investment Accounts 
of the Separate Account in accordance with your allocation instructions prior to
the expiration of the "right to examine" period. If you exercise your right to  
examine the Policy and cancel it by returning it to us, we will refund to you   
the greater of any premiums paid or the Account Value. At the end of the "right 
to examine" period, we transfer the Net Premium and interest to the Fixed       
Account and the Investment Accounts of the Separate Account based on the        
percentages you have selected in the application. For purposes of determining   
the end of the "right to examine" period, solely as it applies to this transfer,
we assume that receipt of this Policy occurs five calendar days after the Issue 
Date.                                                                           

Premium payments requiring satisfactory evidence of insurability will not be    
credited to the Policy until underwriting has been completed and the premium    
payment has been accepted. If the additional premium payment is rejected, AUL   
will return the premium payment immediately, without any adjustment for         
investment experience.                                                          

TRANSFER PRIVILEGE 

You may transfer amounts between the Fixed Account and Investment Accounts or   
among Investment Accounts at any time after the "right to examine" period.      

There currently is no minimum transfer amount, although we reserve the right to 
require a $100 minimum transfer. You must transfer the minimum amount, or, if   
less, the entire amount in the account from which you are transferring each     
time a                                                                          

19

P-->49720th�"Page"�of�58TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
transfer is made. If after the transfer the amount remaining in any account is  
less than $25, we have the right to transfer the entire amount. Any applicable  
transfer charge will be assessed. The charge will be deducted from the          
account(s) from which the transfer is made on a pro rata basis.                 

Transfers are made such that the Account Value on the date of transfer will not 
be affected by the transfer, except for the deduction of any transfer charge.   
We reserve the right to limit the number of transfers to 12 per year, or to     
restrict transfers from being made on consecutive Valuation Dates.              

If we determine that the transfers made by or on behalf of one or more Owners   
are to the disadvantage of other Owners, we may restrict the rights of certain  
Owners. We also reserve the right to limit the size of transfers and remaining  
balances, to limit the number and frequency of transfers, and to discontinue    
telephone transfers.                                                            

The first 12 transfers during each Policy Year are free. Any unused free        
transfers do not carry over to the next Policy Year. We reserve the right to    
assess a $25 charge for the thirteenth and each subsequent transfer during a    
Policy Year. For the purpose of assessing the charge, each request (internet or 
telephone request described below) is considered to be one transfer, regardless 
of the number of Investment Accounts or the Fixed Account affected by the       
transfer. The charge will be deducted from the Investment Account(s) from which 
the transfers are made.                                                         

Unless AUL restricts the right of an Owner to transfer funds as stated above,   
there is no limit on the number of transfers that can be made between Investment
Accounts or to the Fixed Account. There is a limit on the amount transferred    
from the Fixed Account each Policy Year. See "Transfers from Fixed Account" for 
restrictions.                                                                   

TELEPHONE AND INTERNET TRANSFERS. Telephone transfers will be based upon        
instructions given by telephone, provided the appropriate election has been made
at the time of application or proper authorization has been provided to us.     
Transfers initiated via AUL's Internet site Account Services, AUL.com, will be  
processed as a result of authorization given by the user accessing the site. We 
reserve the right to suspend telephone or internet transfer privileges at any   
time, for any reason, if we deem such suspension to be in the best interests of 
Owners. We will employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions       
communicated by telephone or via the Internet are genuine, and if we follow     
those procedures, we will not be liable for any losses due to unauthorized or   
fraudulent instructions. We may be liable for such losses if we do not follow   
those reasonable procedures. The procedures we will follow for telephone        
transfers include requiring some form of personal identification prior to acting
on instructions received by telephone, providing written confirmation of the    
transaction, and making a tape recording of the instructions given by telephone.

ABUSIVE TRADING PRACTICES 

LATE TRADING. Some investors attempt to profit from trading in Investment       
Accounts after the close of the market, but before the Variable Account has     
actually been priced. Because the market has closed, these investors have       
actual knowledge of the price of the securities prior to its calculation. They  
are, therefore, executing trades with information that was not readily          
available to the market, thereby benefiting financially to the detriment of     
other Owners and Participants.                                                  

AUL prohibits late trading in its Investment Accounts. The Variable Account     
dates and time stamps all trades from whatever source and allows only those     
trades received prior to the close of the market to receive that day's unit     
value. All trades received after this point will receive the next day's         
calculated unit value.                                                          

MARKET TIMING. Some investors attempt to profit from various short-term or      
frequent trading strategies commonly known as market timing. Excessive purchases
and redemptions disrupt underlying portfolio management, hurt underlying fund   
performance and drive underlying fund expenses higher. These costs are borne by 
all Owners, including long-term investors who do not generate these costs.      

AUL discourages market timing and excessive trading. If you intend to engage in 
such practices, do not invest in the Variable Account. AUL reserves the right to
reject any request to purchase or redeem units which it reasonably determines to
be in connection with market timing or excessive trading by an investor or by   
accounts of investors under common control (for example, related contract       
owners, or a financial advisor with discretionary trading authority for multiple
accounts).                                                                      

AUL does not always know and cannot always reasonably detect such trading. AUL's
policies and procedures only address market timing after the fact and are not   
prophylactic measures; they will only prevent market timing going forward once  
discovered. However, AUL does monitor for excessive short term trading within   
its separate accounts. A report is run daily to identify, at the omnibus level, 
net trades by Investment Account. Omnibus trades in an individual Investment    
Account that exceed a certain dollar amount or percentage of assets will        
identify potential abusive trading. The dollar amounts and asset percentages are
determined by a market timing task force, and are enforced against all          
policyholders consistently. Once a possible abuse is flagged, the individual    
trades for the previous ten days are reviewed to determine if a similar trade   
amount was executed in the opposite direction over that period.                 

If a purchase/redemption match is found, then the blotters for the two trade    
dates are analyzed to determine if the same policyholder has ordered the        
purchase and redemption. If an individual is identified, the administrative     
area is notified. Policyholder trading history is reviewed to determine if the  
trading activity is indeed abusive short term trading. This procedure is        
enforced against all policyholders consistently.                                

If it is determined that the trading activity violates AUL's policy, then the   
policyholder is notified of restrictions on their account. The policyholder's   
access to internet and interactive voice response trades are turned off and they
are limited to a specific number of trades per month, as determined by the Task 
Force. The threshold established by the Task Force will be enforced against all 
policyholders consistently. While these procedures are only triggered in the    
event that the omnibus level limit is                                           

20

P-->49721st�"Page"�of�58TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�21st
met, there are no exceptions to these procedures and they are followed uniformly
once the omnibus level triggers are met.                                        

AUL will not enter into any agreement with any individual, corporation, Plan or 
other entity that would permit such activity for that entity while discouraging 
it for other Owners.                                                            

Some funds may charge a redemption fee for short term trading in their fund.    
Furthermore, some funds monitor trading at the omnibus level and enforce their  
own policies and procedures based on suspected abusive trading. Please consult  
the funds' prospectus for more details. AUL will cooperate and assist the fund  
in enforcing any fund specific policies and procedures.                         

INITIAL DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PROGRAM 

Under the Initial DCA Program, the Owner selects either a six month Initial DCA 
Program or a twelve month Initial DCA Program. Once the first premium is        
deposited into the Enhanced Averaging Fixed Account, AUL will transfer out an   
amount each month that ensures that the entire balance of the Enhanced Averaging
Fixed Account will be transferred within a six month or twelve month period     
based on the Owners election at issue. The unit values are determined on the    
dates of the transfers. To participate in the Program, AUL requires a minimum   
deposit of $10,000 into the Enhanced Averaging Fixed Account. Transfers to any  
of the Fixed Account(s) are not permitted under the Initial Dollar Cost         
Averaging Program. AUL offers the Initial Dollar Cost Averaging Program to      
Contract Owners at no charge, and the Company reserves the right to terminate,  
change or temporarily discontinue the Program at any time. Contract Owners may  
accelerate transfers into one or more Investment Accounts or discontinue        
participation in the Program at any time by providing Proper Notice to AUL. AUL 
must receive Proper Notice of such a change at least five days before a         
previously scheduled transfer is to occur.                                      

Contract Owners may only elect to participate in the Initial DCA Program by     
requesting it at issue. The Program will take effect on the first monthly       
transfer date following the premium receipt by AUL at its Home Office. The      
initial transfer will occur 30 days after the expiration of the "Right to       
Examine" period. Subsequent transfers will occur at monthly intervals after the 
date of the initial transfer. If the date is not a Valuation Date, then the     
transfer will be made on the next Valuation Date.                               

ONGOING DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PROGRAM 

The Ongoing Dollar Cost Averaging Program, if elected, enables you to transfer  
systematically and automatically, on a monthly basis, specified dollar amounts  
from the OneAmerica Money Market Investment Account ("MMIA") to other Investment
Accounts. By allocating on a regularly scheduled basis, as opposed to allocating
the total amount at one particular time, you may be less susceptible to the     
impact of market fluctuations. However, participation in the Ongoing Dollar Cost
Averaging Program does not assure a Contract Owner of greater profits from the  
purchases under the Program, nor will it prevent or necessarily alleviate losses
in a declining market.                                                          

You specify the fixed dollar amount to be transferred automatically from the    
MMIA. At the time that you elect the Ongoing Dollar Cost Averaging Program, the 
Account Value in the MMIA from which transfers will be made must be at least    
$2,000.                                                                         

You may elect this Program at the time of application by completing the         
authorization on the application or at any time after the Policy is issued by   
properly completing and returning the election form. Transfers made under the   
Ongoing Dollar Cost Averaging Program will commence on the Monthiversary on or  
next following the election.                                                    

Once elected, transfers from the MMIA will be processed until the value of the  
Investment Account is completely depleted, or you send us Proper Notice         
instructing us to cancel the transfers.                                         

Currently, transfers made under the Ongoing Dollar Cost Averaging Program will  
not be subject to any transfer charge and will not count against the number of  
free transfers permitted in a Policy Year. We reserve the right to impose a $25 
transfer charge for each transfer effected under a Ongoing Dollar Cost Averaging
Program. We also reserve the right to alter the terms or suspend or eliminate   
the availability of the Ongoing Dollar Cost Averaging Program at any time.      

PORTFOLIO REBALANCING PROGRAM 

You may elect to have the accumulated balance of each Investment Account        
redistributed to equal a specified percentage of the Variable Account. This will
be done on a quarterly or annual basis from the Monthiversary on which the      
Portfolio Rebalancing Program commences. If elected, this plan automatically    
adjusts your Portfolio mix to be consistent with the allocation most recently   
requested. The redistribution will not count toward the 12 free transfers       
permitted each Policy Year. If the Ongoing Dollar Cost Averaging Program has    
been elected, the Portfolio Rebalancing Program will not commence until the     
Monthiversary following the termination of the Ongoing Dollar Cost Averaging    
Program.                                                                        

You may elect this plan at the time of application by completing the            
authorization on the application or at any time after the Policy is issued by   
properly completing the election form and returning it to us. Modification of   
new money allocations will not, by itself, modify the Portfolio Rebalancing     
allocations.                                                                    

Portfolio rebalancing will terminate when you request any transfer (which       
includes a loan transaction) or the day we receive Proper Notice instructing us 
to cancel the Portfolio Rebalancing Program. Portfolio Rebalancing is not       
available if you choose the Portfolio Optimization Program, as annual           
rebalancing is independently a part of that Program.                            

We do not currently charge for this program. We reserve the right to alter the  
terms or suspend or eliminate the availability of portfolio rebalancing at any  
time.

PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION PROGRAM 

The Service. Portfolio Optimization is an asset allocation service that we offer
at no additional charge for use within this variable life Policy. Asset         
allocation refers to the manner that investments are distributed among asset    
classes to help attain an investment goal. For your Policy, Portfolio           
Optimization can help with decisions about how you should allocate your Account 
Value among available Investment Options. The theory behind Portfolio           
Optimization is that diversification among asset classes can help reduce        
volatility over the long term.                                                  

As part of our Portfolio Optimization service, we have developed several asset  
allocation models ("Portfolio Optimization Models" or "Models"), each based on  
different profiles of an investor's willingness to accept investment risk. If   
you decide to subscribe to the Portfolio Optimization service and select one of 
the Portfolio Optimization Models, your initial Purchase Payment (in the case of
a new application) or Account Value, as applicable, will be allocated to the    
Investment Options according to the Model you select. Subsequent Purchase       
Payments, if allowed under your Policy, will also be allocated accordingly.     

If you subscribe to Portfolio Optimization, we will serve as your investment    
Advisor for the service, with all associated fiduciary responsibilities, solely 
for purposes of development of the Portfolio Optimization Models and periodic   
updates of the Models.                                                          

On a periodic basis (typically annually) or when AUL believes appropriate, the  
Portfolio Optimization Models are evaluated and the Models are updated. If you  
subscribe to Portfolio Optimization, we will automatically reallocate your      
Account Value in accordance with the Model you select as it is updated from time
to time based on discretionary authority that you grant to us, unless you       
instruct us otherwise. For more information on our role as investment advisor   
for the Portfolio Optimization service, please see our brochure from our Form   
ADV, the SEC investment adviser registration form, which is included as an      
exhibit and delivered with this prospectus. In developing and periodically      
updating the Portfolio Optimization Models, we currently rely on the            
recommendations of an independent third-party analytical firm. We may change the
firm that we use from time to time, or, to the extent permissible under         
applicable law, use no independent firm at all.                                 

The Portfolio Optimization Models. We offer five asset allocation models, each  
comprised of a carefully selected combination of AUL-offered Funds. Development 
of the Portfolio Optimization models is a two-step process. First, an           
optimization analysis is performed to determine the breakdown of asset classes. 
Optimization analysis requires forecasting returns, standard deviations and     
correlation coefficients of asset classes over the desired investing horizon and
an analysis using a state-of-the art program and a statistical analytical       
technique known as "mean-variance optimization." Next, after the asset class    
exposures are known, a determination is made of how available Investment Options
(underlying Portfolios) can be used to implement the asset class level          
allocations. The Investment Options are selected by evaluating the asset classes
represented by the underlying Portfolios and combining Investment Options to    
arrive at the desired asset class exposures. The Portfolio-specific analysis    
uses historical returns-based style analysis and asset performance and          
regression and attribution analyses. It may also include portfolio manager      
interviews. Based on this analysis, Investment Options are selected in a way    
intended to optimize potential returns for each Model, given a particular level 
of risk tolerance. This process could, in some cases, result in the inclusion of
an Investment Option in a Model based on its specific asset class exposure or   
other specific optimization factors, even where another Investment Option may   
have better historical performance.                                             

Periodic Updates of the Portfolio Optimization Model and Notices of Updates.    
Each of the Portfolio Optimization Models are evaluated periodically (generally,
annually) to assess whether the combination of Investment Options within each   
Model should be changed to better seek to optimize the potential return for the 
level of risk tolerance intended for the Model. As a result of the periodic     
analysis, each Model may change and Investment Options may be added to a Model  
(including Investment Options not currently available), or Investment Options   
may be deleted from a Model.                                                    

When your Portfolio Optimization Model is updated, we will automatically        
reallocate your Account Value (and subsequent Premiums, if applicable) in       
accordance with any changes to the Model you have selected. This means the      
allocation of your Account Value, and potentially the Investment Options in     
which you are invested, will automatically change and your Account Value (and   
subsequent Premiums, if applicable) will be automatically reallocated among the 
Investment Options in your updated Model. We require that you grant us          
discretionary investment authority to periodically reallocate your Account Value
(and subsequent Premiums, if applicable) in accordance with the updated version 
of the Portfolio Optimization Model you have selected, if you wish to           
participate in Portfolio Optimization.                                          

When we update the Portfolio Optimizations Models, we will send you written     
notice of the updated Models at least 30 days in advance of the date we intend  
the updated version of the Model to be effective. You should carefully review   
these notices. If you wish to accept the changes in your selected Model, you    
will not need to take any action, as your Account Value (or subsequent Premiums,
if applicable) will be reallocated in accordance with the updated Model         
automatically. If you do not wish to accept the changes to your selected Model, 
you can change to a different Model or withdraw from the Portfolio Optimization 
service. Some of the riders available under the Contract require you to         
participate in a specific asset allocation service. If you purchased any of     
these riders, such riders will terminate if you withdraw from Portfolio         
Optimization or allocate any portion of your subsequent Premiums or Account     
Value to an Investment Option that is not currently allowed with the rider (as  
more fully described in each rider).                                            

Selecting a Portfolio Optimization Model. If you choose to subscribe to the     
Portfolio Optimization service, you need to determine which Portfolio           
Optimization Model is best for you. AUL will not make this decision. You should 
consult with your registered representative on this decision. Your registered   
representative can help you determine which Model is best suited to your        
financial needs, investment time horizon, and willingness to accept investment  
risk. You should periodically review these factors with your registered         
representative to determine if you should change Models to keep up with changes 
in your personal circumstances. Your registered                                 

22

P-->49723rd�"Page"�of�58TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�23rd
representative can assist you in completing the proper forms to subscribe to the
Portfolio Optimization service or to change to a different Model. You may, in   
consultation with your registered representative, utilize analytical tools made 
available by AUL, including an investor profile questionnaire, which asks       
questions intended to help you or your registered representative assess your    
financial needs, investment time horizon, and willingness to accept investment  
risk. It is your decision, in consultation with your registered representative, 
to select a Model or to change to a different Model, and AUL bears no           
responsibility for this decision. You may change to a different Model at any    
time with a proper written request or by telephone or electronic instructions   
provided a valid telephone/electronic authorization is on file with us.         

Quarterly Reports. If you select a Portfolio Optimization Model, you will be    
sent a quarterly report that provides information about the Investment Options  
within your selected Model, in addition to or as part of your usual quarterly   
statement.                                                                      

Risks. Although the Models are designed to optimize returns given the various   
levels of risk, there is no assurance that a Model portfolio will not lose money
or that investment results will not experience volatility. Investment           
performance of your Account Value could be better or worse by participating in a
Portfolio Optimization Model than if you had not participated. A Model may      
perform better or worse than any single Investment Option or asset class or     
other combinations of Investment Options or asset classes. Model performance is 
dependent upon the performance of the component Investment Options (and their   
underlying Portfolios). The timing of your investment and the rebalancing may   
affect performance. Your Account Value will fluctuate, and when redeemed, may be
worth more or less than the original cost.                                      

A Portfolio Optimization Model may not perform as intended. Although the Models 
are intended to optimize returns given various levels of risk tolerance,        
portfolio, market and asset class performance may differ in the future from the 
historical performance and assumptions upon which the Models are based, which   
could cause the Models to be ineffective or less effective in reducing          
volatility.                                                                     

Periodic updating of the Portfolio Optimization Models can cause the underlying 
Portfolios to incur transactional expenses to raise cash for money flowing out  
of the Portfolios or to buy securities with money flowing into the Portfolios.  
These expenses can adversely affect performance of the pertinent Portfolios and 
the Models.                                                                     

AUL may be subject to competing interests that have the potential to influence  
its decision making with regard to Portfolio Optimization. For example, one     
Portfolio may provide a higher fee to AUL than another Portfolio, and provide   
AUL with incentive to use the Portfolio with the higher fee as part of a        
Portfolio Optimization Model. In addition, AUL may believe that certain         
Portfolios may benefit from additional assets or could be harmed by redemptions.
As advisor to OneAmerica Funds, Inc., we monitor performance of the Portfolios, 
and may, from time to time, recommend to the Fund's Board of Directors a change 
in portfolio management firm or strategy or the closure or merger of a          
Portfolio, all of which could impact a Model. All Fund Portfolios are analyzed  
by the independent third party analytical firm. We do not dictate to the third  
party analytical firm the number of Portfolios in a Model, the percent that any 
Portfolio represents in a Model, or which Portfolios may be selected (other than
to require exclusion of any Portfolio that is expected to be liquidated, merged 
into another Portfolio, or otherwise closed). We believe our reliance on the    
recommendations of an independent third-party analytical firm to develop and    
update the Models (as described above) reduces or eliminates the potential for  
us to be influenced by these competing interests, but there can be no assurance 
of this.                                                                        

AUL is under no contractual obligation to continue this service and has the     
right to terminate or change the Portfolio Optimization service at any time.    

You may change your model selection at any time with Proper Notice. You should  
consult with your registered representative to assist you in determining which  
model is best suited to your financial needs, investment time horizon, and is   
consistent with your risk comfort level. You should periodically review those   
factors to determine if you need to change models to reflect such changes. Your 
registered representative can assist you in completing the proper forms to      
enroll in Portfolio Optimization. Although the models are designed to optimize  
returns given the various levels of risk, there is no assurance that a model    
Portfolio will not lose money or that investment results will not experience    
some volatility. Historical market and asset class performance may differ in the
future from the historical performance and assumptions upon which the models are
built. Allocation to a single asset class may outperform a model, so that you   
would have obtained better returns in a single investment option or options     
representing a single asset class than in a model. Model Portfolio performance  
is dependent upon the performance of the component investment options. The      
timing of your investment and the frequency of automatic rebalancing may affect 
performance. The value of the Variable Accounts will fluctuate, and when        
redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. We have the right to
terminate or change the Portfolio Optimization service at any time.             

 FIXED ACCOUNT

SUMMARY OF THE FIXED ACCOUNT 

Because of exemptive and exclusionary provisions, interests in the Fixed Account
have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, nor has the Fixed    
Account been registered as an investment company under the Investment Company   
Act of 1940 Act. Accordingly, neither the Fixed Account nor any interests       
therein are subject to the provisions of these Acts and, as a result, the staff 
of the SEC has not reviewed the disclosure in this Prospectus relating to the   
Fixed Account. The disclosure regarding the Fixed Account, may, however, be     
subject to certain generally applicable provisions of the federal securities    
laws relating to the accuracy and completeness of statements made in            
prospectuses.                                                                   

You may allocate some or all of the Net Premiums and transfer some or all of the
Variable Account value to the Fixed Account,

which is part of our general account and pays interest at declared rates        
(subject to a minimum interest rate we guarantee to be 3%). Our general account 
supports our insurance and annuity obligations.                                 

The portion of the Account Value allocated to the Fixed Account will be credited
with rates of interest, as described below. Since the Fixed Account is part of  
our general account, we benefit from investment gain and assume the risk of     
investment loss on this amount. All assets in the general account are subject to
our general liabilities from business operations.                               

MINIMUM GUARANTEED AND CURRENT INTEREST RATES 

The Account Value in the Fixed Account earns interest at one or more interest   
rates determined by AUL at its discretion and declared in advance ("Current     
Rate"), which are guaranteed by AUL to be at least equal to a minimum effective 
annual rate of 3% ("Guaranteed Rate"). AUL will determine a Current Rate from   
time to time and, generally, any Current Rate that exceeds the Guaranteed Rate  
will be effective for the Policies for a period of at least one year. We reserve
the right to change the method of crediting from time to time, provided that    
such changes do not have the effect of reducing the guaranteed rate of interest.
AUL bears the investment risk for Owner's Fixed Account values and for paying   
interest at the Current Rate on amounts allocated to the Fixed Account.         

ENHANCED AVERAGING FIXED ACCOUNT 

Initial and subsequent premiums in the first Contract Year, and prior to the    
expiration of the Initial DCA Program, may be allocated to the Enhanced         
Averaging Fixed Account. AUL will transfer out an amount each month that ensures
that the entire balance of the Enhanced Averaging Fixed Account will be         
transferred within six months or one year after the initial deposit into this   
account.                                                                        

Amounts allocated in the Enhanced Averaging Fixed Account earn interest at rates
periodically determined by AUL that are guaranteed to be at least an effective  
annual rate of 3%. Any current rate that exceeds the guaranteed rate will be    
effective for a period of at least six months or one year after the initial     
deposit into the Enhanced Averaging Fixed Account. Subsequent deposits into the 
Enhanced Averaging Fixed Account will be credited with the current rate at the  
time of the deposit.                                                            

CALCULATION OF THE FIXED ACCOUNT VALUE 

Fixed Account value at any time is equal to amounts allocated or transferred to 
the Fixed Account, plus interest credited minus amounts deducted, transferred,  
or surrendered from the Fixed Account.                                          

TRANSFERS FROM THE FIXED ACCOUNT 

The amount transferred from the Fixed Account in any Policy Year may not exceed 
20% of the amount in the Fixed Account at the beginning of the Policy Year, less
any Partial Surrenders made from the Fixed Account since that date, unless the  
balance after the transfer is less than $25, in which case we reserve the right 
to transfer the entire amount.                                                  

PAYMENT DEFERRAL 

We reserve the right to defer payment of any surrender, Partial Surrender, or   
transfer from the Fixed Account for up to six months from the date of receipt of
the Proper Notice for the partial or full surrender or transfer. In this case,  
interest on Fixed Account assets will continue to accrue at the then-current    
rates of interest.                                                              

CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS

PREMIUM EXPENSE CHARGES 

PREMIUM TAX CHARGE. A 2.5% charge for state and local premium taxes and related 
administrative expenses is deducted from each premium payment. The state and    
local premium tax charge reimburses AUL for premium taxes and related           
administrative expenses associated with the Policies. AUL expects to pay an     
average state and local premium tax rate (including related administrative      
expenses) of approximately 2.5% of premium payments for all states, although    
such tax rates range from 0% to 4%. This charge may be more or less than the    
amount actually assessed by the state in which a particular Owner lives.        

SALES CHARGE. AUL deducts a sales charge from each premium payment. The sales   
charge for contracts issued after May 1, 2000 is currently 2.5% of each premium 
paid.                                                                           

MONTHLY DEDUCTION 

AUL will deduct Monthly Deductions on the Contract Date and on each             
Monthiversary. Monthly Deductions due on the Contract Date and any              
Monthiversaries prior to the Issue Date are deducted on the Issue Date. Your    
Contract Date is the date used to determine your Monthiversary. The Monthly     
Deduction consists of (1) cost of insurance charge, (2) monthly administrative  
charge, and (3) any charges for rider benefits, as described below. The Monthly 
Deduction is deducted from the Variable Account (and each Investment Account)   
and Fixed Account pro rata on the basis of the portion of Account Value in each 
account.                                                                        

COST OF INSURANCE CHARGE. This charge compensates AUL for the expense of        
providing insurance coverage. The charge depends on a number of variables and   
therefore will vary between Policies and from Monthiversary to Monthiversary.   
The Policy contains guaranteed cost of insurance rates that may not be          
increased. The guaranteed rates are no greater than the 1980 Commissioners      
Standard Ordinary Non-Smoker and Smoker Mortality Tables (the "1980 CSO         
Tables") (and where unisex cost of insurance rates apply, the 1980 CSO-C        
Tables). The guaranteed rates for substandard classes are based on multiples of 
or additives to the 1980 CSO Tables. These rates are based on the Attained Age  
and underwriting class of the Insured. They are also based on the sex of the    
Insured, except that unisex rates are used where appropriate under applicable   
law, including in the state of Montana, and in Policies purchased by employers  
and employee organizations in connection with employment-related insurance or   
benefit programs. The cost of insurance rate generally increases with the       
Attained Age of the Insured. As of the date of this Prospectus, we charge       
"current rates" that are                                                        

24

P-->49725th�"Page"�of�58TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�25th
generally lower (i.e., less expensive) than the guaranteed rates, and we may    
also charge current rates in the future. The current rates may also vary with   
the Attained Age, gender, where permissible, duration of each Face Amount       
segment, Policy size and underwriting class of the Insured. For any Policy, the 
cost of insurance on a Monthiversary is calculated by multiplying the current   
cost of insurance rate for the Insured by the Risk Amount for that              
Monthiversary. The Risk Amount on a Monthiversary is the difference between the 
Death Benefit divided by 1.00246627 and the Account Value.                      

The cost of insurance charge for each Face Amount segment will be determined on 
each Monthiversary. AUL currently places Insureds in the following classes,     
based on underwriting: Standard Tobacco User, Standard Non-Tobacco User,        
Preferred Tobacco User, Preferred Non-Tobacco User. An Insured may be placed in 
a substandard risk class, which involves a higher mortality risk than the       
Standard Tobacco User or Standard Non-Tobacco User classes. Standard Non-Tobacco
User rates are available for Issue Ages 0-85. Preferred Non-Tobacco and         
Preferred Tobacco User rates are available for Issue Ages 20-85. The guaranteed 
maximum cost of insurance rate is set forth on the Policy Data Page of your     
Policy.                                                                         

AUL places the Insured in a risk class when the Policy is given underwriting    
approval, based on AUL's underwriting of the application. When an increase in   
Face Amount is requested, AUL conducts underwriting before approving the        
increase (except as noted below), and a separate risk class may apply to the    
increase. If the risk class for the increase has higher guaranteed cost of      
insurance rates than the existing class, the higher guaranteed rates will apply 
only to the increase in Face Amount, and the existing risk class will continue  
to apply to the existing Face Amount. If the risk class for the increase has    
lower guaranteed cost of insurance rates than the existing class, the lower     
guaranteed rates will apply to both the increase and the existing Face Amount.  

MONTHLY ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE. The monthly administrative charge is a level     
monthly charge. For Contracts issued after May 1, 2000, the charge is currently 
$17.50 during the first Policy Year, and $6 thereafter, which applies in all    
years. It is guaranteed not to exceed $10 after the first Policy Year. This     
charge reimburses AUL for expenses incurred in the administration of the        
Policies and the Separate Account. Such expenses include, but are not limited   
to: underwriting and issuing the Policy, confirmations, annual reports and      
account statements, maintenance of Policy records, maintenance of Separate      
Account records, administrative personnel costs, mailing costs, data processing 
costs, legal fees, accounting fees, filing fees, the costs of other services    
necessary for Owner servicing and all accounting, valuation, regulatory and     
updating requirements.                                                          

COST OF ADDITIONAL BENEFITS PROVIDED BY RIDERS. The cost of additional benefits 
provided by riders is charged to the Account Value on the Monthiversary.        

MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE 

AUL deducts this monthly charge from the Variable Account Value pro rata based  
on the amounts in each account. The current charge is at an annual rate of 0.75%
of Variable Account value during the first 10 Policy Years, and 0.25%           
thereafter, and is guaranteed not to increase for the duration of a Policy. AUL 
may realize a profit from this charge.                                          

The mortality risk assumed is that Insureds, as a group, may live for a shorter 
period of time than estimated and, therefore, the cost of insurance charges     
specified in the Policy will be insufficient to meet actual claims. AUL also    
assumes the mortality risk associated with guaranteeing the Death Benefit during
the Guarantee Period. The expense risk AUL assumes is that expenses incurred in 
issuing and administering the Policies and the Separate Account will exceed the 
amounts realized from the monthly administrative charges assessed against the   
Policies.                                                                       

SURRENDER CHARGE 

During the first fifteen Policy Years, a surrender charge will be deducted from 
the Account Value if the Policy is completely surrendered for cash. The total   
surrender charge will not exceed the maximum surrender charge set forth in the  
Policy. The surrender charge is equivalent to 100% of the base coverage target  
premium for Policy Years 1 through 5, reducing thereafter by 10% annually       
through Policy Year 15. The "base coverage target premium" is the target premium
associated with the base coverage of the Policy only, not including any riders  
or benefits.                                                                    

Partial Surrenders are limited to the Cash Value of the Policy; therefore, there
is no surrender charge assessed on Partial Surrenders. Any surrender in excess  
of Cash Value will constitute a complete surrender and the above surrender      
charge will apply.                                                              

The surrender charge for a reinstated Policy will be based on the number of     
Policy Years from the original Contract Date. For purposes of determining the   
surrender charge on any date after reinstatement, the period the Policy was     
lapsed will be credited to the total Policy period.                             

The table below shows the surrender charge (which is a percentage of target     
premium) deducted if the Policy is completely surrendered during the first      
fifteen Policy Years.

TAXES 

AUL does not currently assess a charge for any taxes other than state premium   
taxes incurred as a result of the establishment, maintenance, or operation of   
the Investment Accounts of the Separate Account. We reserve the right, however, 
to assess a                                                                     

25

P-->49726th�"Page"�of�58TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
charge for such taxes against the Investment Accounts if we determine that such 
taxes will be incurred.                                                         

SPECIAL USES 

We may agree to reduce or waive the surrender charge or the Monthly Deduction,  
or credit additional amounts under the Policies in situations where selling     
and/or maintenance costs associated with the Policies are reduced, such as the  
sale of several Policies to the same Owner(s), sales of large Policies, sales of
Policies in connection with a group or sponsored arrangement or mass            
transactions over multiple Policies. In addition, we may agree to reduce or     
waive some or all of these charges and/or credit additional amounts under the   
Policies for those Policies sold to persons who meet criteria established by us,
who may include current and retired officers, directors and employees of us and 
our affiliates. We may also agree to waive minimum premium requirements for     
such persons.                                                                   

We will only reduce or waive such charges or credit additional amounts on any   
Policies where expenses associated with the sale of the Policy and/or costs     
associated with administering and maintaining the Policy are reduced. We reserve
the right to terminate waiver/reduced charge and crediting programs at any time,
including those for previously issued Policies.                                 

FUND EXPENSES 

Each Investment Account of the Separate Account purchases shares at the net     
asset value of the corresponding Portfolio. The net asset value reflects the    
investment advisory fee and other expenses that are deducted from the assets of 
the Portfolio. The advisory fees and other expenses are not fixed or specified  
under the terms of the Policy and are described in the Funds' prospectuses.     

HOW YOUR ACCOUNT VALUES VARY

There is no minimum guaranteed Account Value, Cash Value or Net Cash Value.     
These values will vary with the investment performance of the Investment        
Accounts and/or the crediting of interest in the Fixed Account, and will depend 
on the allocation of Account Value. If the Net Cash Value on a Monthiversary is 
less than the amount of the Monthly Deduction to be deducted on that date and   
the Guarantee Period is not then in effect, the Policy will be in default and a 
grace period will begin. See "Premium Payments to Prevent Lapse."

DETERMINING THE ACCOUNT VALUE 

On the Contract Date, the Account Value is equal to the initial Net Premium less
the Monthly Deductions deducted as of the Contract Date. On each Valuation Day  
thereafter, the Account Value is the aggregate of the Variable Account value,   
the Fixed Account value, and the Loan Account value. Account Value may be       
significantly affected on days when the New York Stock Exchange is open for     
trading but we are closed for business, and you will not have access to Cash    
Value on those days. The Account Value will vary to reflect the performance of  
the Investment Accounts to which amounts have been allocated, interest credited 
on amounts allocated to the Fixed Account, interest credited on amounts in the  
Loan Account, charges, transfers, Partial Surrenders, loans and loan repayments.

VARIABLE ACCOUNT VALUE. When you allocate an amount to an Investment Account,   
either by Net Premium payment allocation or by transfer, your Policy is credited
with accumulation units in that Investment Account. The number of accumulation  
units credited is determined by dividing the amount allocated to the Investment 
Account by the Investment Account's accumulation unit value at the end of the   
Valuation Period during which the allocation is effected. The Variable Account  
value of the Policy equals the sum, for all Investment Accounts, of the         
accumulation units credited to an Investment Account multiplied by that         
Investment Account's accumulation unit value.                                   

The number of Investment Account accumulation units credited to your Policy will
increase when Net Premium payments are allocated to the Investment Account and  
when amounts are transferred to the Investment Account. The number of Investment
Account accumulation units credited to a Policy will decrease when the allocated
portion of the Monthly Deduction and mortality and expense charge are taken from
the Investment Account, a loan is made, an amount is transferred from the       
Investment Account, or a Partial Surrender is taken from the Investment Account.

ACCUMULATION UNIT VALUES. An Investment Account's accumulation unit value is    
determined on each Valuation Date and varies to reflect the investment          
experience of the underlying Portfolio. It may increase, decrease, or remain the
same from Valuation Period to Valuation Period. The accumulation unit value for 
the money market Investment Accounts were initially set at $1, and the          
accumulation unit value for each of the other Investment Accounts was           
arbitrarily set at $5 when each Investment Account was established. For each    
Valuation Period after the date of establishment, the accumulation unit value is
determined by multiplying the value of an accumulation unit for an Investment   
Account for the prior Valuation Period by the net investment factor for the     
Investment Account for the current Valuation Period.                            

NET INVESTMENT FACTOR. The net investment factor is used to measure the         
investment performance of an Investment Account from one Valuation Period to the
next. For any Investment Account, the net investment factor for a Valuation     
Period is determined by dividing (a) by (b), where:                             

(a) is equal to:                                                                

1. the net asset value per share of the Portfolio held in the Investment
 Account determined at the end of the current Valuation Period; plus

    2. the per share amount of any dividend or capital gain distribution paid by
the Portfolio during the Valuation Period; plus                   

3. the per share credit or charge with respect to taxes, if any, paid or
    reserved for by AUL during the Valuation Period that are determined by
    AUL to be attributable to the operation of the Investment Account; and

26

P-->49727th�"Page"�of�58TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�27th
(b) is equal to:                                                                

1. the net asset value per share of the Portfolio held in the Investment
   Account determined at the end of the preceding Valuation Period; plus

    2. the per share credit or charge for any taxes reserved for the immediately
preceding Valuation Period.                                       

FIXED ACCOUNT VALUE. On any Valuation Date, the Fixed Account                   
value of a Policy is the total of all Net Premium payments allocated            
to the Fixed Account, plus any amounts transferred to the Fixed                 
Account, plus interest credited on such Net Premium payments                    
and amounts transferred, less the amount of any transfers from                  
the Fixed Account, less the amount of any Partial Surrenders taken              
from the Fixed Account, and less the pro rata portion of the                    
Monthly Deduction charged against the Fixed Account.                            

LOAN ACCOUNT VALUE. On any Valuation Date, if there have been any Policy loans, 
the Loan Account value is equal to amounts transferred to the Loan Account from 
the Investment Accounts and from the Fixed Account as collateral for Policy     
loans and for due and unpaid loan interest, less amounts transferred from the   
Loan Account to the Investment Accounts and the Fixed Account as outstanding    
loans and loan interest are repaid, and plus interest credited to the Loan      
Account.                                                                        

CASH VALUE AND NET CASH VALUE 

The Cash Value on a Valuation Date is the Account Value less any applicable     
surrender charges. The Net Cash Value on a Valuation Date is the Cash Value     
reduced by any outstanding loans and loan interest. Net Cash Value is used to   
determine whether a grace period starts. See "Premium Payments to Prevent
Lapse." It is also the amount that is available upon full surrender of the      
Policy. See "Surrendering the Policy for Net Cash Value."

DEATH BENEFIT AND CHANGES IN FACE AMOUNT 

As long as the Policy remains in force, AUL will pay the Death Benefit Proceeds 
upon receipt at the Home Office of satisfactory proof of the Insured's death.   
AUL may require return of the Policy. The Death Benefit Proceeds may be paid in 
a lump sum, generally within seven calendar days of receipt of satisfactory     
proof (see "When Proceeds Are Paid"), or in any other way agreeable to you and  
us. Before the Insured dies, you may choose how the proceeds are to be paid. If 
you have not made a choice before the Insured dies, the beneficiary may choose  
how the proceeds are paid. The Death Benefit Proceeds will be paid to the       
beneficiary. See " Selecting and Changing the Beneficiary." Coverage is         
effective on the later of the date the initial premium is paid or the Issue     
Date.                                                                           

AMOUNT OF DEATH BENEFIT PROCEEDS 

The Death Benefit Proceeds are equal to the sum of the Death Benefit in force as
of the end of the Valuation Period during which death occurs, plus any rider    
benefits, minus any outstanding loan and loan interest on that date. If the date
of death occurs during a grace period, the Death Benefit will still be payable  
to the beneficiary, although the amount will be equal to the Death Benefit      
immediately prior to the start of the grace period, plus any benefits provided  
by rider, and less any outstanding loan and loan interest and overdue Monthly   
Deductions and mortality and expense risk charges as of the date of death. Under
certain circumstances, the amount of the Death Benefit may be further adjusted. 
See "Limits on Rights to Contest the Policy" and "Changes in the Policy or
Benefits."                                                                      

If part or all of the Death Benefit Proceeds is paid in one sum, AUL will pay   
interest on this sum if required by applicable state law from the date of the   
Insured's death to the date of payment.                                         

DEATH BENEFIT OPTIONS 

The Owner may choose one of two Death Benefit options. Under Option 1, the Death
Benefit is the greater of the Face Amount or the Applicable Percentage (as      
described below) of Account Value on the date of the Insured's death. Under     
Option 2, the Death Benefit is the greater of the Face Amount plus the Account  
Value on the date of death, or the Applicable Percentage of the Account Value on
the date of the Insured's death.                                                

If investment performance is favorable, the amount of the Death Benefit may     
increase. However, under Option 1, the Death Benefit ordinarily will not change 
for several years to reflect any favorable investment performance and may not   
change at all. Under Option 2, the Death Benefit will vary directly with the    
investment performance of the Account Value. To see how and when investment     
performance may begin to affect the Death Benefit, see "Illustrations of Account
Values, Cash Values, Death Benefits and Accumulated Premium Payments."

INITIAL FACE AMOUNT AND DEATH BENEFIT OPTION 

The initial Face Amount is set at the time the Policy is issued. You may change 
the Face Amount from time to time, as discussed below. You select the Death     
Benefit option when you apply for the Policy. You also may change the Death     
Benefit option, as discussed below. We reserve the right, however, to decline   
any change which might disqualify the Policy as life insurance under federal tax
law.                                                                            

CHANGES IN DEATH BENEFIT OPTION 

Beginning one year after the Contract Date, as long as the Policy is not in the 
grace period, you may change the Death Benefit option on your Policy subject to 
the following rules. If you request a change from Death Benefit Option 2 to     
Death Benefit Option 1, the Face Amount will be increased by the amount of the  
Account Value on the date of change. The change will be effective on the        
Monthiversary following our receipt of Proper Notice.                           

If you request a change from Death Benefit Option 1 to Death Benefit Option 2,  
the Face Amount will be decreased by the amount of the Account Value on the date
of change. We may require satisfactory evidence of insurability. The change will
be effective on the Monthiversary following our approval of the change. We will 
not permit a change which would decrease the Face Amount below $50,000.         

CHANGES IN FACE AMOUNT 

Beginning one year after the Contract Date, as long as the Policy is not in the 
grace period, you may request a change in the Face Amount. If a change in the   
Face Amount would result in total premiums paid exceeding the premium           
limitations prescribed under current tax law to qualify your Policy as a life   
insurance contract, AUL will refund, after the next Monthiversary, the amount of
such excess above the premium limitations. Changes in Face Amount may cause the 
Policy to be treated as a Modified Endowment for federal tax purposes.          

AUL reserves the right to decline a requested decrease in the Face Amount if    
compliance with the guideline premium limitations under current tax law would   
result in immediate termination of the Policy, payments would have to be made   
from the Cash Value for compliance with the guideline premium limitations, and  
the amount of such payments would exceed the Net Cash Value under the Policy.   

The Face Amount after any decrease must be at least $50,000. A decrease in Face 
Amount will become effective on the Monthiversary that next follows receipt of  
Proper Notice of a request.                                                     

Decreasing the Face Amount of the Policy may have the effect of decreasing      
monthly cost of insurance charges. If you have made any increases to the Face   
Amount, the decrease will first be applied to reduce those increases, starting  
with the most recent increase. The decrease will not cause a decrease in either 
the Required Premium for the Guarantee Period or the surrender charge.          

Any increase in the Face Amount must be at least $5,000 (unless otherwise       
provided by rider), and an application must be submitted. AUL reserves the right
to require satisfactory evidence of insurability. In addition, the Insured's    
Attained Age must be less than the current maximum Issue Age for the Policies,  
as determined by AUL from time to time. A change in planned premiums may be     
advisable. If the Policy is within the Guarantee Period on the effective date of
the increase, Required Premiums will be increased accordingly. See "Premiums."  
The increase in Face Amount will become effective on the Monthiversary on or    
next following our approval of the increase.                                    

For purposes of calculating cost of insurance charges, any Face Amount decrease 
will be used to reduce any previous Face Amount increase then in effect,        
starting with the latest increase and continuing in the reverse order in which  
the increases were made. If any portion of the decrease is left after all Face  
Amount increases have been reduced, it will be used to reduce the initial Face  
Amount.                                                                         

SELECTING AND CHANGING THE BENEFICIARY 

You select the beneficiary in your application. You may select more than one    
beneficiary. You may later change the beneficiary in accordance with the terms  
of the Policy. The primary beneficiary, or, if the primary beneficiary is not   
living, the contingent beneficiary, is the person entitled to receive the Death 
Benefit Proceeds under the Policy. If the Insured dies and there is no surviving
beneficiary, the Owner (or the Owner's estate if the Owner is the Insured) will 
be the beneficiary. If a beneficiary is designated as irrevocable, then the     
beneficiary's written consent must be obtained to change the beneficiary.       

 CASH BENEFITS

POLICY LOANS 

Prior to the death of the Insured, you may borrow against your Policy by        
submitting Proper Notice to the Home Office at any time after the end of the    
"right to examine" period while the Policy is not in the grace period. The      
Policy is assigned to us as the sole security for the loan. The minimum amount  
of a new loan is $500. The maximum amount of a new loan is:                     

1. 90% of the Account Value; less                                       

2. any loan interest due on the next Policy Anniversary; less           

3. any applicable surrender charges; less                               

4. any existing loans and accrued loan interest.                        

Outstanding loans reduce the amount available for new loans. Policy loans will  
be processed as of the date your written request is received. Loan proceeds     
generally will be sent to you within seven calendar days. See "When Proceeds Are
Paid."                                                                          

INTEREST. AUL will charge interest on any outstanding loan at an annual rate of 
6.0%. Interest is due and payable on each Policy Anniversary while a loan is    
outstanding. If interest is not paid when due, the amount of the interest is    
added to the loan and becomes part of the loan.                                 

LOAN COLLATERAL. When a Policy loan is made, an amount sufficient to secure the 
loan is transferred out of the Investment Accounts and the Fixed Account and    
into the Policy's Loan                                                          

28

P-->49729th�"Page"�of�58TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�29th
Account. Thus, a loan will have no immediate effect on the Account Value, but   
the Net Cash Value will be reduced immediately by the amount transferred to the 
Loan Account. The Owner can specify the Investment Accounts from which          
collateral will be transferred. If no allocation is specified, collateral will  
be transferred from each Investment Account and from the Fixed Account in the   
same proportion that the Account Value in each Investment Account and the Fixed 
Account bears to the total Account Value in those accounts on the date that the 
loan is made. Due and unpaid interest will be transferred each Policy           
Anniversary from each Investment Account and the Fixed Account to the Loan      
Account in the same proportion that each Investment Account value and the Fixed 
Account bears to the total unloaned Account Value. The amount we transfer will  
be the amount by which the interest due exceeds the interest which has been     
credited on the Loan Account.                                                   

The Loan Account will be credited with interest daily at an effective annual    
rate of not less than 4.0%. Any interest credited in excess of the minimum      
guaranteed rate is not guaranteed.                                              

LOAN REPAYMENT; EFFECT IF NOT REPAID. You may repay all or part of your loan at 
any time while the Insured is living and the Policy is in force. Loan repayments
must be sent to the Home Office and will be credited as of the date received. A 
loan repayment must be clearly marked as "loan repayment" or it will be credited
as a premium, unless the premium would cause the Policy to fail to meet the     
federal tax definition of a life insurance contract in accordance with the      
Internal Revenue Code. Loan repayments, unlike premium payments, are not subject
to premium expense charges. When a loan repayment is made, Account Value in the 
Loan Account in an amount equivalent to the repayment is transferred from the   
Loan Account to the Investment Accounts and the Fixed Account. Thus, a loan     
repayment will have no immediate effect on the Account Value, but the Net Cash  
Value will be increased immediately by the amount of the loan repayment. Loan   
repayment amounts will be transferred to the Investment Accounts and the Fixed  
Account according to the premium allocation instructions in effect at that time.

If the Death Benefit becomes payable while a loan is outstanding, any           
outstanding loan and loan interest will be deducted in calculating the Death    
Benefit Proceeds. See "Amount of Death Benefit Proceeds."                       

If the Monthly Deduction exceeds the Net Cash Value on any Monthiversary when   
the Guarantee Period is not in force, the Policy will be in default. You will be
sent notice of the default. You will have a grace period within which you may   
submit a sufficient payment to avoid termination of coverage under the Policy.  
The notice will specify the amount that must be repaid to prevent termination.  
See "Premium Payments to Prevent Lapse."                                        

EFFECT OF POLICY LOAN. A loan, whether or not repaid, will have a permanent     
effect on the Death Benefit and Policy values because the investment results of 
the Investment Accounts of the Separate Account and current interest rates      
credited on Account Value in the Fixed Account will apply only to the non-      
loaned portion of the Account Value. The longer the loan is outstanding, the    
greater the effect is likely to be. Depending on the investment results of the  
Investment Accounts while the loan is outstanding, the effect could be favorable
or unfavorable. Policy loans may increase the potential for lapse if investment 
results of the Investment Accounts are less than anticipated. Also, loans could,
particularly if not repaid, make it more likely than otherwise for a Policy to  
terminate. See "Tax Considerations" for a discussion of the tax treatment of    
Policy loans, and the adverse tax consequences if a Policy lapses with loans    
outstanding. In particular, if your Policy is a Modified Endowment, loans may be
currently taxable and subject to a 10% penalty tax.                             

SURRENDERING THE POLICY FOR NET CASH VALUE 

You may surrender your Policy at any time for its Net Cash Value by submitting  
Proper Notice to us. AUL may require return of the Policy. A surrender charge   
may apply. See "Surrender Charge." A surrender request will be processed as of  
the date your written request and all required documents are received. Payment  
will generally be made within seven calendar days. See "When Proceeds are Paid."
The Net Cash Value may be taken in one lump sum or it may be applied to a       
settlement option. See "Settlement Options." The Policy will terminate and cease
to be in force if it is surrendered for one lump sum or applied to a settlement 
option. It cannot later be reinstated. Surrenders may have adverse tax          
consequences. See "Tax Considerations."

PARTIAL SURRENDERS 

You may make Partial Surrenders under your Policy of at least $500 at any time  
after the end of the "right to examine" period by submitting Proper Notice to   
us. As of the date AUL receives Proper Notice for a Partial Surrender, the      
Account Value and, therefore, the Cash Value will be reduced by the Partial     
Surrender.                                                                      

When you request a Partial Surrender, you can direct how the Partial Surrender  
will be deducted from the Investment Accounts and/or the Fixed Account. If you  
provide no directions, the Partial Surrender will be deducted from your Account 
Value in the Investment Accounts and Fixed Account on a pro rata basis. Partial 
Surrenders may have adverse tax consequences. See "Tax Considerations."         

AUL will reduce the Face Amount by an amount equal to the Partial Surrender. AUL
will reject a Partial Surrender request if the Partial Surrender would reduce   
the Face Amount below $50,000, or if the Partial Surrender would cause the      
Policy to fail to qualify as a life insurance contract under applicable tax     
laws, as interpreted by AUL.                                                    

Partial Surrender requests will be processed as of the date your written request
is received, and generally will be paid within seven calendar days. See "When
Proceeds Are Paid."

SETTLEMENT OPTIONS 

At the time of surrender or death, the Policy offers various options of         
receiving proceeds payable under the Policy. These settlement options are       
summarized below. All of these options are forms of fixed-benefit annuities     
which do not vary with the investment performance of a separate account. Any    
representative authorized to sell this Policy can further explain these options 
upon request.                                                                   

29

P-->49730th�"Page"�of�58TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
You may apply proceeds of $2,000 or more which are payable under this Policy to 
any of the following options:                                                   

OPTION 1 - INCOME FOR A FIXED PERIOD. Proceeds are payable in equal monthly     
installments for a specified number of years, not to exceed 20.                 

OPTION 2 - LIFE ANNUITY. Proceeds are paid in equal monthly installments for as 
long as the payee lives. A number of payments can be guaranteed, such as 120, or
the number of payments required to refund the proceeds applied.                 

OPTION 3 - SURVIVORSHIP ANNUITY. Proceeds are paid in monthly installments for  
as long as either the first payee or surviving payee lives. A number of payments
equal to the initial payment can be guaranteed, such as 120. A different monthly
installment payable to the surviving payee can be specified. Any other method   
or frequency of payment we agree to may be used to pay the proceeds of this     
Policy.                                                                         

Policy proceeds payable in one sum will accumulate at interest from the date of 
death or surrender to the payment date at the rate of interest then paid by us  
or at the rate specified by statute, whichever is greater. Based on the         
settlement option selected, we will determine the amount payable. The minimum   
interest rate used in computing payments under all options will be 3% per year. 

You may select or change an option by giving Proper Notice prior to the         
settlement date. If no option is in effect on the settlement date, the payee may
select an option. If this Policy is assigned or if the payee is a corporation,  
association, partnership, trustee or estate, a settlement option will be        
available only with our consent.                                                

If a payee dies while a settlement option is in effect, and there is no         
surviving payee, we will pay a single sum to such payee's estate. The final     
payment will be the commuted value of any remaining guaranteed payments.        

Settlement option payments will be exempt from the claims of creditors to the   
maximum extent permitted by law.                                                

MINIMUM AMOUNTS. AUL reserves the right to pay the total amount of the Policy in
one lump sum, if less than $2,000. If monthly payments are less than $100,      
payments may be made less frequently at AUL's option.                           

The proceeds of this Policy may be paid in any other method or frequency of     
payment acceptable to us.                                                       

SPECIALIZED USES OF THE POLICY 

Because the Policy provides for an accumulation of Cash Value as well as a Death
Benefit, the Policy can be used for various individual and business financial   
planning purposes. Purchasing the Policy in part for such purposes entails      
certain risks. For example, if the investment performance of Investment Accounts
to which Variable Account value is allocated is poorer than expected or if      
sufficient premiums are not paid, the Policy may lapse or may not accumulate    
sufficient Variable Account value to fund the purpose for which the Policy was  
purchased. Partial Surrenders and Policy loans may significantly affect current 
and future Account Value, Net Cash Value, or Death Benefit Proceeds. Depending  
upon Investment Account investment performance and the amount of a Policy loan, 
the loan may cause a Policy to lapse. Because the Policy is designed to provide 
benefits on a long-term basis, before purchasing a Policy for a specialized     
purpose a purchaser should consider whether the long-term nature of the Policy  
is consistent with the purpose for which it is being considered. Using a Policy 
for a specialized purpose may have tax conse- quences. See "Tax Considerations."

LIFE INSURANCE RETIREMENT PLANS 

Any Owners or applicants who wish to consider using the Policy as a funding     
vehicle for non-qualified retirement purposes may obtain additional information 
from us. An Owner could pay premiums under a Policy for a number of years, and  
upon retirement, could utilize a Policy's loan and partial withdrawal features  
to access Account Value as a source of retirement income for a period of time.  
This use of a Policy does not alter an Owner's rights or our obligations under a
Policy; the Policy would remain a life insurance contract that, so long as it   
remains in force, provides for a Death Benefit payable when the Insured dies.   

Illustrations are available upon request that portray how the Policy can be used
as a funding vehicle for non-qualified retirement plans, referred to herein as  
"life insurance retirement plans," for individuals. Illustrations provided upon 
request show the effect on Account Value, Cash Value, and the net Death Benefit 
of premiums paid under a Policy and partial withdrawals and loans taken for     
retirement income; or reflecting allocation of premiums to specified Investment 
Accounts. This information will be portrayed at hypothetical rates of return    
that are requested. Charts and graphs presenting the results of the             
illustrations or a comparison of retirement strategies will also be furnished   
upon request. Any graphic presentations and retirement strategy charts must be  
accompanied by a corresponding illustration; illustrations must always include  
or be accompanied by comparable information that is based on guaranteed cost of 
insurance rates and that presents a hypothetical gross rate of return of 0%.    
Retirement illustrations will not be furnished with a hypothetical gross rate of
return in excess of 12%.                                                        

The hypothetical rates of return in illustrations are illustrative only and     
should not be interpreted as a representation of past or future investment      
results. Policy values and benefits shown in the illustrations would be         
different if the gross annual investment rates of return were different from the
hypothetical rates portrayed, if premiums were not paid when due, and whether   
loan interest was paid when due. Withdrawals or loans may have an adverse effect
on Policy benefits.                                                             

RISKS OF LIFE INSURANCE RETIREMENT PLANS 

Using your Policy as a funding vehicle for retirement income purposes presents  
several risks, including the risk that if your Policy is insufficiently funded  
in relation to the income stream expected from your Policy, your Policy can     
lapse prematurely and result in significant income tax liability to you in the  
year in which the lapse occurs. Other risks associated with borrowing from your 
Policy also apply. Loans will be automatically repaid from the Death Benefit at 
the death of the Insured, resulting in                                          

30

P-->49731st�"Page"�of�58TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�31st
the estimated payment to the beneficiary of the Death Benefit Proceeds, which   
will be less than the Death Benefit and may be less than the Face Amount. Upon  
surrender, the loan will be automatically repaid, resulting in the payment to   
you of the Net Cash Value. Similarly, upon lapse, the loan will be automatically
repaid, and the Policy will terminate without value. The automatic repayment of 
the loan upon lapse or surrender will cause the recognition of taxable income to
the extent that Net Cash Value plus the amount of the repaid loan exceeds your  
basis in the Policy. Thus, under certain circumstances, surrender or lapse of   
your Policy could result in tax liability to you. In addition, to reinstate a   
lapsed Policy, you would be required to make certain payments. Thus, you should 
be careful to design a life insurance retirement plan so that your Policy will  
not lapse prematurely under various market scenarios as a result of withdrawals 
and loans taken from your Policy.                                               

To avoid lapse of your Policy, it is important to design a payment stream that  
does not leave your Policy with insufficient Net Cash Value. Determinations as  
to the amount to withdraw or borrow each year warrant careful consideration.    
Careful consideration should also be given to any assumptions respecting the    
hypothetical rate of return, to the duration of withdrawals and loans, and to   
the amount of Account Value that should remain in your Policy upon its maturity.
Poor investment performance can contribute to the risk that your Policy may     
lapse. In addition, the cost of insurance generally increases with the age of   
the Insured, which can further erode existing Net Cash Value and contribute to  
the risk of lapse. Further, interest on a Policy loan is due to us for any      
Policy Year on the Policy Anniversary. If this interest is not paid when due,   
it is added to the amount of the outstanding loans and loan interest, and       
interest will begin accruing thereon from that date. This can have a compounding
effect, and to the extent that the outstanding loan balance exceeds your basis  
in the Policy, the amounts attributable to interest due on the loans can add to 
your federal (and possibly state) income tax liability. You should consult with 
your financial and tax advisors in designing a life insurance retirement plan   
that is suitable for your particular needs. Further, you should continue to     
monitor the Net Cash Value remaining in a Policy to assure that the Policy is   
sufficiently funded to continue to support the desired income stream and so that
it will not lapse. In this regard, you should consult your periodic statements  
to determine the amount of the remaining Net Cash Value. Illustrations showing  
the effect of charges under the Policy upon existing Account Value or the effect
of future withdrawals or loans upon the Policy's Account Value and Death Benefit
are available from your representative. Consideration should be given           
periodically to whether the Policy is sufficiently funded so that it will not   
lapse prematurely.                                                              

Because of the potential risks associated with borrowing from a Policy, use of  
the Policy in connection with a life insurance retirement plan may not be       
suitable for all Owners. These risks should be carefully considered before      
borrowing from the Policy to provide an income stream.                          

OTHER POLICY BENEFITS AND PROVISIONS

LIMITS ON RIGHTS TO CONTEST THE POLICY 

INCONTESTABILITY. In the absence of fraud, after the Policy has been in force   
during the Insured's lifetime for two years from the Contract Date, AUL may not 
contest the Policy. Any increase in the Face Amount will not be contested after 
the increase has been in force during the Insured's lifetime for two years      
following the effective date of the increase. If you did not request the Face   
Amount increase or if evidence of insurability was not required, we will not    
contest the increase.                                                           

If a Policy lapses and it is reinstated, we can contest the reinstated Policy   
during the first two years after the effective date of the reinstatement, but   
only for statements made in the application for reinstatement.                  

SUICIDE EXCLUSION. If the Insured dies by suicide, while sane or insane, within 
two years of the Contract Date or the effective date of any reinstatement (or   
less if required by state law), the amount payable by AUL will be equal to the  
premiums paid less any loan, loan interest, and any Partial Surrender.          

If the Insured dies by suicide, while sane or insane, within two years after the
effective date of any increase in the Face Amount (or less if required by state 
law), the amount payable by AUL on such increase will be limited to the Monthly 
Deduction associated with the increase.                                         

CHANGES IN THE POLICY OR BENEFITS 

MISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR SEX. If it is determined the age or sex of the Insured as
stated in the Policy is not correct, the Death Benefit will be the greater of:  
(1) the amount which would have been purchased at the Insured's correct age and 
sex by the most recent cost of insurance charge assessed prior to the date we   
receive proof of death; or (2) the Account Value as of the date we receive proof
of death, multiplied by the Minimum Insurance Percentage for the correct age.   

OTHER CHANGES. Upon notice, AUL may modify the Policy, but only if such         
modification is necessary to: (1) make the Policy or the Separate Account comply
with any applicable law or regulation issued by a governmental agency to which  
AUL is subject; (2) assure continued qualification of the Policy under the      
Internal Revenue Code or other federal or state laws relating to variable life  
contracts; (3) reflect a change in the operation of the Separate Account; or (4)
provide different Separate Account and/or Fixed Account accumulation options.   

AUL reserves the right to modify the Policy as necessary to attempt to prevent  
the Owner from being considered the owner of the assets of the Separate Account.
In the event of any such modification, AUL will issue an appropriate endorsement
to the Policy, if required. AUL will exercise these rights in accordance with   
applicable law, including approval of Owners, if required.                      

Any change of the Policy must be approved by AUL's President, Executive Vice    
President, Vice President or Secretary. No representative is authorized to      
change or waive any provision of the Policy.                                    

CHANGE OF INSURED 

While the Policy is in force, it may be exchanged for a new Policy on the life  
of a substitute Insured. The exercise of this                                   

31

P-->49732nd�"Page"�of�58TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
exchange is subject to satisfactory evidence of insurability for the substitute 
Insured. The Contract Date of the new Policy will generally be the same as the  
Contract Date of the exchanged Policy. The Issue Date of the new Policy will be 
the date of the exchange. The initial Cash Value of the new Policy will be the  
same as the Cash Value of the exchanged Policy on the date of the exchange.     
Exercise of the Change of Insured provision will result in a taxable exchange.  

EXCHANGE FOR PAID-UP POLICY 

You may exchange the Policy for a paid-up whole life policy by Proper Notice and
upon returning the Policy to the Home Office. The new policy will be for the    
level face amount, not greater than the Policy's Face Amount, which can be      
purchased by the Policy's Net Cash Value. The new policy will be purchased using
the continuous net single premium for the Insured's age upon the Insured's last 
birthday at the time of the exchange. We will pay you any remaining Net Cash    
Value that was not used to purchase the new policy.                             

At any time after this option is elected, the cash value of the new policy will 
be its net single premium at the Insured's then attained age. All net single    
premiums will be based on 3% interest and the guaranteed cost of insurance rates
of the Policy. No riders may be attached to the new policy.                     

WHEN PROCEEDS ARE PAID 

AUL will ordinarily pay any Death Benefit Proceeds, loan proceeds, Partial      
Surrender proceeds, or Full Surrender proceeds within seven calendar days after 
receipt at the Home Office of all the documents required for such a payment.    
Other than the Death Benefit, which is determined as of the date of death, the  
amount will be determined as of the date of receipt of required documents.      
However, AUL may delay making a payment or processing a transfer request if (1) 
the New York Stock Exchange is closed for other than a regular holiday or       
weekend, trading is restricted by the SEC, or the SEC declares that an emergency
exists as a result of which the disposal or valuation of Separate Account assets
is not reasonably practicable; or (2) the SEC by order permits postponement of  
payment to protect Owners.                                                      

DIVIDENDS 

You will receive any dividends declared by us as long as the Policy is in force.
Dividend payments will be applied to increase the Account Value in the          
Investment Accounts and Fixed Account on a pro rata basis unless you request    
cash payment. We do not anticipate declaring any dividends on this policy.      

REPORTS TO POLICY OWNERS 

At least once a year, you will be sent a report at your last known address      
showing, as of the end of the current report period: Account Value, Cash Value, 
Death Benefit, amount of interest credited to amounts in the Fixed Account,     
change in value of amounts in the Separate Account, premiums paid, loans,       
Partial Surrenders, expense charges, and cost of insurance charges since the    
prior report. You will also be sent an annual and a semi-annual report for each 
Fund or Portfolio underlying an Investment Account to which you have allocated  
Account Value, including a list of the securities held in each Fund, as required
by the 1940 Act. In addition, when you pay premiums (except for premiums        
deducted automatically), or if you take out a loan, transfer amounts among the  
Investment Accounts and Fixed Account or take surrenders, you will receive a    
written confirmation of these transactions.                                     

ASSIGNMENT 

The Policy may be assigned in accordance with its terms. In order for any       
assignment to be binding upon AUL, it must be in writing and filed at the Home  
Office. Once AUL has received a signed copy of the assignment, the Owner's      
rights and the interest of any beneficiary (or any other person) will be subject
to the assignment. If there are any irrevocable beneficiaries, you must obtain  
their written consent before assigning the Policy. AUL assumes no responsibility
for the validity or sufficiency of any assignment. An assignment is subject to  
any loan on the Policy.                                                         

REINSTATEMENT 

The Policy may be reinstated within five years (or such longer period if        
required by state law) after lapse, subject to compliance with certain          
conditions, including the payment of a necessary premium and submission of      
satisfactory evidence of insurability. Premium will be allocated based on the   
current allocations in effect for the Policy. See your Policy for further       
information.                                                                    

RIDER BENEFITS 

The following rider benefits are available and may be added to your Policy at   
issue. (The CBR Rider is the only rider that may be added after issue). If      
applicable, monthly charges for these riders will be deducted from your Account 
Value as part of the Monthly Deduction. All of these riders may not be available
in all states.                                                                  

WAIVER OF MONTHLY DEDUCTION DISABILITY (WMDD) ISSUE AGES: 0-55            

  This rider waives the Monthly Deduction during a period of total disability.
   WMDD cannot be attached to Policies with Face Amounts in excess of $3,000,000
or rated higher than Table H. Monthly Deductions are waived for total     
disability following a six month waiting period. Monthly Deductions made  
during this waiting period are re-credited to the Account Value upon the  
  actual waiver of the Monthly Deductions. If disability occurs before age 60,
Monthly Deductions are waived as long as total disability continues. If   
 disability occurs between ages 60-65, Monthly Deductions are waived as long
as the Insured remains totally disabled but not beyond age 65.            

GUARANTEED INSURANCE OPTION (GIO) ISSUE AGES: 0-39 (STANDARD RISKS ONLY)  

   This rider allows the Face Amount of the Policy to be increased by the option
amount or less, without evidence of insurability on the Insured. These    
increases may occur on regular option dates or alternate option dates. See
the rider contract for the specific dates.                                

32  

P-->49733rd�"Page"�of�58TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�33rd
CHILDREN'S BENEFIT RIDER (CBR) ISSUE AGES: 14 DAYS - 20 YEARS (CHILDREN'S 
AGES)                                                                 

This rider provides level term insurance on each child of the Insured. At 
   issue, each child must be at least 14 days old and less than 20 years of age,
and the Insured must be less than 56 years old and not have a substandard 
rating greater than table H. Once CBR is in force, children born to the   
Insured are covered automatically after they are 14 days old. Children are
covered under CBR until they reach age 22, when they may purchase, without
evidence of insurability, a separate policy with up to five times the     
   expiring face amount of the rider's coverage. The Insured must notify Us when
  all children covered under the CBR have attained the age of 22, in order for
the charge for the rider to be discontinued.                              

OTHER INSURED RIDER (OIR) ISSUE AGES: 0-85 (OTHER INSURED'S AGE)          

The Other Insured Rider is level term life insurance on someone other than
   the Insured. The minimum issue amount is $10,000; the maximum issue amount is
 equal to three times the Face Amount. A maximum of two OIRs may be added to
the Policy. The OIR amount of coverage may be changed in the future, but  
increases are subject to evidence of insurability.                        

  Prior to the Other Insured's age 70, the OIR may be converted to a permanent
  individual policy without evidence of insurability. The OIR may be converted
to permanent coverage on the Monthiversary following the date of the      
Insured's death.                                                          

SAME INSURED RIDER (SIR) ISSUE AGES: 0-85                                 

This rider provides level term life insurance on the Insured. The minimum 
issue amount is $50,000; the maximum issue is equal to five times the Face
  Amount of the Policy. The Company reserves the right to change these minimum
   and maximum issue amounts for new policy issues. Only one SIR may be added to
the Policy. The SIR face amount may be decreased upon policyowner request.

WAIVER OF PREMIUM DISABILITY (WPD) ISSUE AGES: 0-55                       

 This rider pays a designated premium into the Account Value during a period
 of total disability. The minimum designated premium is $100. WPD may not be
 added to a Policy unless WMDD is already added. If disability occurs before
age 60, the designated premium benefit is paid as long as total disability
continues. If disability occurs between ages 60-65, the designated premium
benefit is paid as long as the Insured remains totally disabled but not   
beyond age 65.                                                            

LAST SURVIVOR RIDER (LS) ISSUE AGES: 20-85                                

   This rider modifies the terms of the Policy to provide insurance on the lives
of two Insureds rather than one. When the Last Survivor Rider is attached,
  the Death Benefit Proceeds are paid to the beneficiary upon the death of the
   last surviving Insured. The cost of insurance charges reflect the anticipated
   mortality of the two Insureds and the fact that the Death Benefit is not paid
until the death of the surviving Insured. For a Policy containing the LS  
   Rider to be reinstated, either both Insureds must be alive on the date of the
  reinstatement, or the surviving Insured must be alive and the lapse occurred
after the death of the first Insured. The Incontestability, Suicide, and  
  Misstatement of Age or Sex provisions of the Policy apply to either Insured.

LS Rider also provides a Policy Split Option, allowing the Policy on two  
Insureds to be split into two separate Policies, one on the life of each  
Insured. The LS Rider also includes an Estate Preservation Benefit which  
  increases the Face Amount of the Policy under certain conditions. The Estate
   Preservation Benefit is only available to standard risks and preferred risks.

AUTOMATIC INCREASE RIDER (AIR) ISSUE AGES: 0-55 (STANDARD RISKS ONLY)     

This rider increases the Insured's base coverage by 5% each year, without 
   evidence of insurability. The 5% increase is compounded annually and is based
on the base coverage Face Amount on Policy Anniversaries. No increases are
made during any period in which the Monthly Deduction is being waived.    
   Insured's initial base coverage must be at least $100,000. This rider is only
available with Death Benefit Option 2.                                    

  AIR terminates on the earliest of the following dates: the date an automatic
increase is rejected, the date the Face Amount is decreased, the date     
requested in writing by the Owner, the date of Policy termination, or the 
 anniversary date 20 years after issue of this rider. There is no charge for
   AIR. New coverage generated by the rider results in an increase in the target
  premium. All charges for any new coverage are based on the Insured's nearest
age at the time of increase.                                              

GUARANTEED MINIMUM DEATH BENEFIT RIDER (GMDB)                             

This rider extends the Guarantee Period as listed on the Policy Data Page.
While the GMDB rider is in force, the Policy will remain in force and will
  not begin the grace period if on each Monthiversary, the sum of the premiums
paid to date, less any Partial Surrenders, any outstanding loan and loan  
 interest, equals or exceeds the required premium for the Guaranteed Minimum
Death Benefit multiplied by the number of Policy months since the Contract
  Date. The guarantee provided by this rider terminates if this test is failed
on any Monthiversary. The guarantee will not be reinstated. The GMDB Rider
is only available to standard and preferred risks.                        

ACCELERATED DEATH BENEFIT RIDER (ABR)                                     

   This rider allows for a prepayment of a portion of the Policy's Death Benefit
while the Insured is still alive, if the Insured has been diagnosed as    
terminally ill, and has 12 months or less to live. The minimum amount     
available is $5,000. The maximum benefit payable (in most states) is the  
  lesser of $500,000 or 50% of the Face Amount. ABR may be added to the Policy
at any time while it is still in force. This rider is not available if the
Last Survivor Rider is issued. There is no charge for ABR. The Accelerated
 Death Benefit Rider cannot be exercised if Long Term Care Accelerated Death
Benefits are paid.

LONG-TERM CARE ACCELERATED DEATH BENEFIT RIDER                            

Applicants residing in states that have approved the Long-Term Care       
Accelerated Death Benefit Rider (the "ADBR") may elect to add it to their 
   Policy at issue, subject to AUL receiving satisfactory additional evidence of
insurability. This rider may be attached along with a Last Survivor Rider.
 The ADBR is not yet available in all states and the form and/or terms under
which it is available may vary from state to state. The ADBR permits the  
Owner to receive, at his or her request and upon approval by AUL in       
  accordance with the terms of the ADBR, an accelerated payment of part of the
Policy's Death Benefit (an "Accelerated Death Benefit") and an additional 
extended long-term care benefit when one of the following three events    
occurs:                                                                   

   1. Confinement to a Long-Term Care Facility. An Insured is determined to be
     Chronically Ill (as defined below) and has been confined to a Long-Term
   Care Facility for at least 90 days during a period of 270 consecutive
days.                                                             

2. Home Health Care. An Insured is determined to be Chronically Ill (as 
       defined below) and has been receiving home health care (as defined in the
  rider) for at least 90 days during a period of 270 consecutive days.

3. Adult Day Care. An Insured is determined to be Chronically Ill (as   
     defined below) and has been receiving adult day care (as defined in the
  rider) for at least 90 days during a period of 270 consecutive days.

Chronically Ill means that an Insured has been certified (within the preceding  
12-month period) by a licensed health care practitioner as (1) being expected to
be unable to perform (without substantial assistance from another individual) at
least two activities of daily living, including bathing, continence, dressing,  
eating, toileting, and transferring, during a period of at least 90 days; or (2)
requiring substantial supervision to protect the Insured from threats to health 
and safety due to severe cognitive impairment (as such terms are more fully     
described in the ADBR). A charge for this rider will be deducted from the       
Account Value as part of the monthly deductions.                                

TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE ADBR. Subject to certain limitations, the benefits      
payable under the ADBR will generally be excludible from income for Federal     
income tax purposes. See "Tax Considerations."                                  

AMOUNT OF THE ACCELERATED DEATH BENEFIT. The ADBR provides for monthly payments 
subject to a long-term care benefit balance not to exceed the current Policy    
Death Benefit less any outstanding Policy loans and loan interest, and          
additional long-term care benefit payments equal to twelve monthly payments.    
Subject to a maximum monthly benefit of $10,000, the monthly benefits under the 
ADBR will be the actual cost of long-term care expenses up to a maximum of      
1/36th of the Death Benefit for care in a long-term care facility or home health
care; or the actual expenses up to a maximum of 1/72nd of the Death Benefit for 
adult day care.                                                                 

CONDITIONS FOR RECEIPT OF LONG-TERM CARE ACCELERATED DEATH BENEFIT RIDER. In    
order to receive benefits from this rider, the Policy and rider must be in force
and an Owner must submit Proper Notice of the claim to us at our Home Office.   
Proper Notice means notice that is received at our Home Office in a form        
acceptable to us.                                                               

We may request additional medical information from the Insured's physician      
and/or may require an independent physical examination (at our expense) before  
approving the claim for payment of benefits. We will not approve any benefits   
under the rider for a claim which is the result of intentionally self-inflicted 
injury or participation in a felony or if the benefits are payable under        
Medicare or services are provided outside of the United States. Any additional  
exclusions may be noted in the ADBR.                                            

EFFECT ON EXISTING POLICY. The Death Benefit Proceeds otherwise payable under a 
Policy at the time of an Insured's death will be reduced by the amount of the   
payments. If the Owner makes a request for a long-term care accelerated death   
benefit payment, the Policy's Account Value will be reduced proportionally.     
Therefore, depending upon the number and amount of payments, this may result in 
the Account Value being reduced to zero.                                        

Your determination as to how to purchase a desired level of insurance coverage  
should be based on specific insurance needs. Consult your sales representative  
for further information.                                                        

Additional rules and limits apply to these rider benefits. Not all such benefits
may be available at any time, and rider benefits in addition to those listed    
above may be made available. Please ask your AUL representative for further     
information, or contact the Home Office.                                        

ACCOUNTING BENEFIT RIDER. If the Owner fully surrenders his policy while this   
rider is in effect during Policy Years 1 and 2, We will waive all Surrender     
Charges. In addition, we will return any Sales Charge and Premium Tax Charge    
assessed. On a full surrender during Policy Years 3 through 5, We will waive all
Surrender Charges. No Sales Charge or Premium Tax Charge will be returned. We   
will assess the applicable Surrender Charge on full surrenders in Policy Years 6
and later.                                                                      

No waiver of Surrender Charge or refund of Sales Charges and Premium Tax Charges
will occur on a Partial Surrender.                                              

This benefit is only available where the applicant has requested to Us that the 
policy be used as an informal funding vehicle for a non-qualified deferred      
compensation plan.                                                              

TAX CONSIDERATIONS 

The following summary provides a general description of the federal income tax  
considerations associated with the Policy and does not purport to be complete or
to cover all situations. This discussion is not intended as tax advice. Counsel 
or other competent tax advisors should be consulted for more complete           
information. This discussion is based upon AUL's understanding of the present   
federal tax laws as they currently are interpreted by the Internal Revenue      
Service (the "IRS").                                                            

TAX STATUS OF THE POLICY 

In order to attain the tax benefits normally associated with life insurance, the
Policy must be classified for federal income tax                                

34

P-->49735th�"Page"�of�58TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
purposes as a life insurance contract. Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code
sets forth a definition of a life insurance contract for federal income tax     
purposes. The U.S. Treasury Department (the "Treasury") is authorized to        
prescribe regulations implementing Section 7702. While proposed regulations and 
other interim guidance has been issued, final regulations have not been adopted.
In short, guidance as to how Section 7702 is to be applied is limited. If a     
Policy were determined not to be a life insurance contract for purposes of      
Section 7702, such Policy would not provide the tax advantages normally provided
by a life insurance contract.                                                   

With respect to a Policy issued on a standard basis, AUL believes that such a   
Policy should meet the Section 7702 definition of a life insurance contract.    
With respect to a Policy that is issued on a substandard basis (i.e., a premium 
class with extra rating involving higher than standard mortality risk) or one   
involving joint insureds, there is less guidance, in particular as to how the   
mortality and other expense requirements of Section 7702 are to be applied in   
determining whether such a Policy meets the Section 7702 definition of a life   
insurance contract. If the requirements of Section 7702 were deemed not to have 
been met, the Policy would not provide the tax benefits normally associated with
life insurance and the tax status of all contracts invested in the Investment   
Account to which premiums were allocated under the non-qualifying contract might
be affected.                                                                    

If it is subsequently determined that a Policy does not satisfy Section 7702,   
AUL may take whatever steps are appropriate and reasonable to attempt to cause  
such a Policy to comply with Section 7702. For these reasons, AUL reserves the  
right to modify the Policy as it deems necessary in its sole discretion to      
attempt to qualify it as a life insurance contract under Section 7702.          

Section 817(h) of the Internal Revenue Code requires that the investments of    
each of the Investment Accounts must be "adequately diversified" in accordance  
with Treasury regulations in order for the Policy to qualify as a life insurance
contract under Section 7702 of the Internal Revenue Code. The Investment        
Accounts, through the Portfolios, intend to comply with the diversification     
requirements prescribed in Treas. Reg. Section 1.817-5, which affect how the    
Portfolio's assets are to be invested. AUL believes that the Investment Accounts
will meet the diversification requirements, and AUL will monitor continued      
compliance with this requirement.                                               

In certain circumstances, owners of variable life insurance contracts may be    
considered the owners, for federal income tax purposes, of the assets of the    
investment accounts used to support their contracts. In those circumstances,    
income and gains from the investment account assets would be includible in the  
variable contract owner's gross income. The IRS has stated in published rulings 
that a variable contract owner will be considered the owner of investment       
account assets if the contract owner possesses incidents of ownership in those  
assets, such as the ability to exercise investment control over the assets. The 
Treasury has also announced, in connection with the issuance of regulations     
concerning diversification, that those regulations "do not provide guidance     
concerning the circumstances in which investor control of the investments of a  
segregated asset account may cause the investor (i.e., the Owner), rather than  
the insurance company, to be treated as the owner of the assets in the account."
This announcement also stated that guidance would be issued by way of           
regulations or rulings on the "extent to which contract holders may direct their
investments to particular investment accounts without being treated as owners of
the underlying assets."                                                         

The ownership rights under the Policy are similar to, but different in certain  
respects from, those described by the IRS in rulings in which it was determined 
that contract owners were not owners of investment account assets. For example, 
an Owner has additional flexibility in allocating Net Premium payments and      
Account Value. These differences could result in an Owner being treated as the  
owner of a pro rata portion of the assets of the Investment Accounts. In        
addition, AUL does not know what standards will be set forth, if any, in the    
regulations or rulings which the Treasury has stated it expects to issue. AUL   
therefore reserves the right to modify the Policy as necessary to attempt to    
prevent an Owner from being considered the Owner of a pro rata share of the     
assets of the Investment Accounts.                                              

The following discussion assumes that the Policy will qualify as a life         
insurance contract for federal income tax purposes.                             

TAX TREATMENT OF POLICY BENEFITS 

IN GENERAL. AUL believes that the proceeds and Account Value increases of a     
Policy should be treated in a manner consistent with a fixed-benefit life       
insurance contract for federal income tax purposes. Thus, the Death Benefit     
under the Policy should be excludable from the gross income of the beneficiary  
under Section 101(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if you elect a   
settlement option for a Death Benefit other than in a lump sum, a portion of the
payment made to you may be taxable.                                             

Depending on the circumstances, the exchange of a Policy, a change in the       
Policy's Death Benefit option, a Policy loan, a Partial Surrender, a surrender, 
a change in ownership, or an assignment of the Policy may have federal income   
tax consequences. In addition, federal, state and local transfer, and other tax 
consequences of ownership or receipt of Policy proceeds depends on the          
circumstances of each Owner or beneficiary.                                     

The Policy may also be used in various arrangements, including nonqualified     
deferred compensation or salary continuation plans, split dollar insurance      
plans, executive bonus plans, retiree medical benefit plans and others. The tax 
consequences of such plans may vary depending on the particular facts and       
circumstances of each individual arrangement. Therefore, if you are             
contemplating the use of a Policy in any arrangement the value of which depends 
in part on its tax consequences, you should consult a qualified tax advisor     
regarding the tax attributes of the particular arrangement.                     

Generally, the Owner will not be deemed to be in constructive receipt of the    
Account Value, including increments thereof, until there is a distribution. The 
tax consequences of distributions from, and loans taken from or secured by, a   
Policy depend on whether the Policy is classified as a Modified Endowment. Upon 
a complete surrender or lapse of a Policy, whether or not a Modified Endowment, 
the excess of the amount received plus the amount of any outstanding loans and  
loan interest over the                                                          

35

total investment in the Policy will generally be treated as ordinary income     
subject to tax.                                                                 

MODIFIED ENDOWMENTS. Section 7702A establishes a class of life insurance        
Policies designated as "Modified Endowment Contracts." The rules relating to    
whether a Policy will be treated as a Modified Endowment are extremely complex  
and cannot be adequately described in the limited confines of this summary. In  
general, a Policy will be a Modified Endowment if the accumulated premiums paid 
at any time during the first seven Policy Years exceed the sum of the net level 
premiums which would have been paid on or before such time if the Policy        
provided for paid-up future benefits after the payment of seven level annual    
premiums. A Policy may also become a Modified Endowment after a material change.
The determination of whether a Policy will be a Modified Endowment after a      
material change generally depends upon the relationship of the Death Benefit and
Account Value at the time of such change and the additional premiums paid in the
seven years following the material change.                                      

Due to the Policy's flexibility, classification as a Modified Endowment will    
depend on the individual circumstances of each Policy. In view of the foregoing,
a current or prospective Owner should consult with a tax adviser to determine   
whether a Policy transaction will cause the Policy to be treated as a Modified  
Endowment. However, at the time a premium is credited which in AUL's view would 
cause the Policy to become a Modified Endowment, AUL will attempt to notify the 
Owner that unless a refund of the excess premium (with any appropriate interest)
is requested by the Owner, the Policy will become a Modified Endowment. However,
we do not undertake to provide such notice. The Owner will have 30 days after   
receiving such notification to request the refund.                              

Policies classified as Modified Endowments will be subject to the following:    
First, all distributions, including distributions upon surrender and Partial    
Surrender, from such a Policy are treated as ordinary income subject to tax up  
to the amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Account Value immediately     
before the distribution over the investment in the Policy (described below) at  
such time. Second, loans taken from or secured by such a Policy, are treated as 
distributions from the Policy and taxed accordingly. Past due loan interest that
is added to the loan amount will be treated as a loan. Third, a 10 percent      
additional income tax is imposed on the portion of any distribution from, or    
loan taken from or secured by, such a Policy that is included in income except  
where the distribution or loan is made on or after the Owner attains age 59 1/2,
is attributable to the Owner's becoming disabled, or is part of a series of     
substantially equal periodic payments for the life (or life expectancy) of the  
Owner or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the Owner and the      
Owner's beneficiary.                                                            

If a Policy becomes a Modified Endowment after it is issued, distributions made 
during the Policy Year in which it becomes a Modified Endowment, distributions  
in any subsequent Policy Year and distributions within two years before the     
Policy becomes a Modified Endowment will be subject to the tax treatment        
described above. This means that a distribution from a Policy that is not a     
Modified Endowment could later become taxable as a distribution from a Modified 
Endowment.                                                                      

All Modified Endowments that are issued by AUL (or its affiliates) to the same  
Owner during any calendar year are treated as one Modified Endowment for        
purposes of determining the amount includible in an Owner's gross income under  
Section 72(e) of the Internal Revenue Code.                                     

Distributions from a Policy that is not a Modified Endowment are generally      
treated as first recovering the investment in the Policy (described below) and  
then, only after the return of all such investment in the Policy, as            
distributing taxable income. An exception to this general rule occurs in the    
case of a decrease in the Policy's Death Benefit or any other change that       
reduces benefits under the Policy in the first 15 years after the Policy is     
issued and that results in a cash distribution to the Owner in order for the    
Policy to continue complying with the Section 7702 definitional limits. Such a  
cash distribution will be taxed in whole or in part as ordinary income (to the  
extent of any gain in the Policy) under rules prescribed in Section 7702.       

Loans from, or secured by, a Policy that is not a Modified Endowment are not    
treated as distributions. Instead, such loans are treated as advances of the    
death benefit to the Owner. Finally, neither distributions (including           
distributions upon surrender) nor loans from, or secured by, a Policy that is   
not a Modified Endowment are subject to the 10 percent additional income tax.   

POLICY LOAN INTEREST. Generally, consumer interest paid on any loan under a     
Policy which is owned by an individual is not deductible for federal or state   
income tax purposes. The deduction of other forms of interest paid on Policy    
loans may also be subject to other restrictions under the Internal Revenue Code.
A qualified tax adviser should be consulted before deducting any Policy loan    
interest.                                                                       

INVESTMENT IN THE POLICY. Investment in the Policy means: (1) the aggregate     
amount of any premiums or other consideration paid for a Policy, minus (2) the  
aggregate amount received under the Policy which is excluded from gross income  
of the Owner (except that the amount of any loan from, or secured by, a Policy  
that is a Modified Endowment, to the extent such amount is excluded from gross  
income, will be disregarded), plus (3) the amount of any loan from, or secured  
by, a Policy that is a Modified Endowment to the extent that such amount is     
included in the gross income of the Owner.                                      

TAX TREATMENT OF LONG-TERM CARE ACCELERATED DEATH BENEFIT RIDER. It is intended 
that the Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit Rider benefits provided by    
this Policy qualify as tax-free benefits under section 7702B(b) and/or section  
101(g) of the Internal Revenue Code. Benefit amounts from this Policy plus any  
per diem long-term care insurance benefits will be includible in income if they 
exceed the limits set in section 7702B(d).                                      

Charges for this rider may be treated as a taxable distribution from the Policy 
(and might also be subject to the 10% penalty tax if the Policy is a Modified   
Endowment Contract as discussed previously). The Long-Term Care Accelerated     
Death Benefit Rider may be issued in certain States as a "non- qualified" rider;
i.e., it would not constitute qualified long-term care insurance under section  
7702B(b) of the Code. Tax treatment of non-qualified benefits is uncertain at   
this time.

The tax comments in this section reflect our understanding of the current       
federal tax laws as they relate to the Long-Term Care Accelerated Death Benefit 
Rider. Since these laws are subject to interpretation and change, we recommend  
you seek individual advice from your tax advisor.                               

ESTATE AND GENERATION SKIPPING TAXES 

When the Insured dies, the Death Benefits will generally be includible in the   
Owner's estate for purposes of federal estate tax if the Insured owned the      
Policy. If the Owner was not the Insured, the fair market value of the Policy   
would be included in the Owner's estate upon the Owner's death. Nothing would be
includible in the Insured's estate if he or she neither retained incidents of   
ownership at death nor had given up ownership within three years before death.  

Federal estate tax is integrated with federal gift tax under a unified rate     
schedule. An unlimited marital deduction may be available for federal estate and
gift tax purposes. The unlimited marital deduction permits the deferral of taxes
until the death of the surviving spouse.                                        

If the Owner (whether or not he or she is the Insured) transfers ownership of   
the Policy to someone two or more generations younger, the transfer may be      
subject to the generation-skipping transfer tax with the taxable amount being   
the value of the Policy. The generation-skipping transfer tax provisions        
generally apply to transfers which would be subject to the gift and estate tax  
rules. Because these rules are complex, the Owner should consult with a         
qualified tax advisor for specific information if ownership is passing to       
younger generations.                                                            

LIFE INSURANCE PURCHASED FOR USE IN SPLIT DOLLAR ARRANGEMENTS 

Final regulations on split-dollar life insurance arrangements were issued by the
Treasury Department effective September 17, 2003, modifying IRS Notice 2002-8   
(Rev. Rul. 2008-105, I.R.B. 2003-40).                                           

Nonqualified deferred compensation. On October 22, 2004, IRC Section 409A was   
enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Contributions into   
non-qualified deferred compensations plans after December 31, 2004 are governed 
by this code section. Purchasers should consult a qualified tax advisor to      
determine tax treatment resulting from such an arrangement.                     

TAXATION UNDER SECTION 403(b) PLANS 

PURCHASE PAYMENTS. Under Section 403(b) of the Code, payments made by certain   
employers (i.e., tax-exempt organizations meeting the requirements of Section   
501(c)(3) of the Code, or public educational institutions) to purchase Policies 
for their employees are excludible from the gross income of employees to the    
extent that such aggregate purchase payments do not exceed certain limitations  
prescribed by the Code. This is the case whether the purchase payments are a    
result of voluntary salary reduction amounts or employer contributions. Salary  
reduction payments, however, are subject to FICA (social security) taxes.       

TAXATION OF DISTRIBUTIONS. Distributions from a Section 403(b) Policy are taxed 
as ordinary income to the recipient. Taxable distributions received before the  
employee attains Age 59 1/2 generally are subject to 10% penalty tax in addition
to regular income tax. Certain distributions are excepted from this penalty tax 
including distributions following the employee's death, disability, separation  
from service after age 55, separation from service at any age if the            
distribution is in the form of an annuity for the life (or life expectancy) of  
the employee (or the employee and Beneficiary), and distributions not in excess 
of deductible medical expenses. In addition, no distributions of voluntary      
salary reduction amounts made for years after December 31, 1988 (plus earnings  
thereon and earnings on Policy Values as of December 31, 1988) will be permitted
prior to one of the following events: attainment of age 59 1/2 by the employee  
or the employee's separation from service, death, disability or hardship.       
(Hardship distributions will be limited to the lesser of the amount of the      
hardship or the amount of salary reduction contributions, exclusive of earnings 
thereon.)                                                                       

REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS. At the time of retirement, the Policy must be: (1)      
transferred to a non-life insurance 403(b) contract which complies with the     
distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and will continue in     
force, subject to the payment of any required premium, and the provisions of the
403(b) Policy endorsement will no longer apply to the Policy; or (2)            
surrendered; or (3) distributed. Non-Individual Ownership of Contracts If the   
Owner of a Policy is an entity rather than an individual, the tax treatment may 
differ from that described above. Accordingly, prospective Owners that are      
entities should consult a qualified tax advisor.                                

POSSIBLE CHARGE FOR AUL'S TAXES 

At the present time, AUL makes no charge for any federal, state or local taxes  
(other than the charge for state and local premium taxes) that it incurs that   
may be attributable to the Investment Accounts or to the Policies. However, AUL 
reserves the right to make additional charges for any such tax or other economic
burden resulting from the application of the tax laws that it determines to be  
properly attributable to the Investment Accounts or to the Policies.            

OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE POLICIES AND AUL

POLICY TERMINATION 

The Policy will terminate, and insurance coverage will cease, as of: (1) the end
of the Valuation Period during which we receive Proper Notice to surrender the  
Policy; (2) the expiration of a grace period; or (3) the death of the Insured.  
See "Surrendering the Policy for Net Cash Value," "Premium Payments to Prevent
Lapse," and "Death Benefit and Changes in Face Amount."

RESOLVING MATERIAL CONFLICTS 

The Funds presently serve as the investment medium for the Separate Account and,
therefore, indirectly for the Policies.                                         

37

P-->49738th�"Page"�of�58TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
In addition, the Funds have advised us that they are available to registered    
separate accounts of insurance companies, other than AUL, offering variable     
annuity and variable life insurance policies.                                   

We do not currently foresee any disadvantages to you resulting from the Funds   
selling shares as an investment medium for products other than the Policies.    
However, there is a theoretical possibility that a material conflict of interest
may arise between Owners whose Cash Values are allocated to the Separate Account
and the owners of variable life insurance policies and variable annuity         
contracts issued by other companies whose values are allocated to one or more   
other separate accounts investing in any one of the Funds. Shares of some of the
Funds may also be sold to certain qualified pension and retirement plans        
qualifying under Section 401 of the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, there is
a possibility that a material conflict may arise between the interests of Owners
or owners of other contracts (including contracts issued by other companies),   
and such retirement plans or participants in such retirement plans.             

In the event of a material conflict, we will take any necessary steps, including
removing the Separate Account from that Fund, to resolve the matter. The Board  
of Directors/Trustees of each Fund will monitor events in order to identify any 
material conflicts that may arise and determine what action, if any, should be  
taken in response to those events or conflicts.                                 

ADDITION, DELETION OR SUBSTITUTION OF INVESTMENTS                               

We reserve the right, subject to applicable law, to make additions to, deletions
from, or substitutions for the shares that are held in the Separate Account or  
that the Separate Account may purchase. If the shares of a Portfolio are no     
longer available for investment or if, in our judgment, further investment in   
any Portfolio should become inappropriate in view of the purposes of the        
Separate Account, we may redeem the shares, if any, of that Portfolio and       
substitute shares of another registered open-end management investment company. 
We will not substitute any shares attributable to a Policy's interest in an     
Investment Account of the Separate Account without notice to you and prior      
approval of the SEC and state insurance authorities, to the extent required by  
the Investment Company Act of 1940 or other applicable law.                     

We also reserve the right to establish additional Investment Accounts of the    
Separate Account, each of which would invest in shares corresponding to a       
Portfolio of a Fund or in shares of another investment company having a         
specified investment objective. Any new Investment Accounts may be made         
available to existing Owners on a basis to be determined by AUL. Subject to     
applicable law and any required SEC approval, we may, in our sole discretion,   
eliminate one or more Investment Accounts if marketing needs, tax considerations
or investment conditions warrant.                                               

If any of these substitutions or changes are made, we may, by appropriate       
endorsement, change the Policy to reflect the substitution or change.           

If we deem it to be in the best interests of persons having voting rights under 
the Policies (subject to any approvals that may be required under applicable    
law), the Separate Account may be operated as a management investment company   
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, it may be deregistered under that Act 
if registration is no longer required, or it may be combined with other AUL     
separate accounts.                                                              

SALE OF THE POLICIES 

The Policies will be offered to the public on a continuous basis, and we do not 
anticipate discontinuing the offering of the Policies.  However, we reserve the 
right to discontinue the offering. Applications for Policies are solicited by   
representatives who are licensed by applicable state insurance authorities to   
sell our variable life contracts and who are also registered representatives of 
OneAmerica Securities, Inc., which is registered with the SEC under the         
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a broker-dealer and is a member of the       
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. OneAmerica Securities, Inc., is
a wholly owned subsidiary of American United Life Insurance Company, and is the 
distributor and "principal underwriter," as defined in the Investment Company   
Act of 1940, of the Policies for the Separate Account. We are not obligated to  
sell any specific number of Policies.                                           

Registered representatives may be paid commissions on Policies they sell.       
Representatives generally will be paid 50% of planned premiums paid in the first
year for premiums up to target premium. For planned premiums paid in excess of  
target premium, registered representatives will also receive 3% of that excess. 
Additional commissions may be paid in certain circumstances. Other allowances   
and overrides also may be paid.                                                 

STATE REGULATION 

AUL is subject to regulation by the Department of Insurance of the State of     
Indiana, which periodically examines the financial condition and operations of  
AUL. AUL is also subject to the insurance laws and regulations of all           
jurisdictions where it does business. The Policy described in this Prospectus   
has been filed with and, where required, approved by, insurance officials in    
those jurisdictions where it is sold.                                           

AUL is required to submit annual statements of operations, including financial  
statements, to the insurance departments of the various jurisdictions where it  
does business to determine solvency and compliance with applicable insurance    
laws and regulations.                                                           

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

A registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 has been filed with   
the SEC relating to the offering described in this Prospectus. This Prospectus  
does not include all the information set forth in the registration statement.   
The omitted information may be obtained at the SEC's principal office in        
Washington, D.C. by paying the SEC's prescribed fees.                           

LITIGATION 

The Separate Account is not a party to any litigation. Its depositor, AUL, as an
insurance company, ordinarily is involved in litigation. AUL is of the opinion  
that, at present, such litigation is not material to the Owners of the Policies.

II 1.A           AUL offers group variable annuity contracts to be used in      
         connection with certain retirement plans and individual
             variable annuity contracts. These contracts provide for the
            accumulation of values on a variable basis, fixed basis or
            both. Contributions designated to accumulate on a variable
         basis may be allocated to one or more of the investment
        accounts of the AUL American Unit Trusts, AUL American
                 Individual Unit Trust, AUL American Individual Variable Annuity
            Unit Trust, and AUL American Individual Variable Life Unit
                Trust, registered unit investment trusts and separate accounts
              of AUL. AUL acts as the investment advisor to the OneAmerica
           Funds, Inc..("the Fund"). Other mutual fund shares may be
            purchased by the separate accounts from mutual funds which
have investment advisers other than AUL.      

            The Fund and AUL (the"Adviser") entered into an Investment
          Advisor Agreement in 1990 which was approved by the Fund
    shareholders and Trust Participants on May 8,1991.
             Thereafter, the Agreement has been reviewed annually by the
                Fund's Board of Directors unless otherwise required by federal
            securities laws. Subject to the overall supervision of the
                 Fund's Board of Directors, the Adviser exercises responsibility
               for the investment and reinvestment of the Fund's assets. The
             Adviser manages the day-to-day investment operations of the
               Fund and the composition of each of the Portfolios, including
the purchase, retention and disposition of the
       investments, securities and cash contained therein in
            accordance with each Portfolio's investment objectives and
          policies as stated in the Fund's current prospectus. The
                Agreement was last approved by the Board of Directors on March
12,2004.                                      

        Under the Investment Adviser Agreement, the Adviser is
           compensated for its services at a monthly fee based on an
           annual percentage of the average daily net assets of each
                portfolio. For each Portfolio, the Fund pays the Adviser a fee
               at an annual rate of .50% of the Portfolios average daily net
                 assets except for the Money Market Portfolio, the fee for which
is an annual rate of .40%.                    

               AUL has entered into an Agreement of Strategic Alliance dated
                July 18,1994, under the terms of which the parties have agreed
              that AUL will perform certain investment management services
               for and on behalf of State Life Insurance Company. Under this
                Agreement, AUL provides a continuous investment program and is
            responsible for the composition of State Life's investment
           portfolio. In consideration, State Life pays AUL 13 basis

                 year the Agreement remains in effect. State Life is responsible
         for all of the expenses and liabilities relating to its
          investment portfolio and for establishing the investment
          objectives for AUL to follow. AUL agrees to maintain and
              preserve required records related to State Life Investments.

               under the agreement in the amount of 12.5 basis points of the
                outstanding aggregate principal value of the assets which were

                AUL has entered into an agreement whereby Ibbottson Associates
        provides advice to plan sponsors regarding funds to be
             included in the plan. Ibbottson will recommend a plan level
         investment portfolio based on the Plan Sponsor's unique
              employee profile. AUL will charge plan sponsor a maximum fee
                of $2,000, depending on plan assets. AUL pays Ibbottson a flat
fee of $70,000 per year for the service.      

Portfolio Optimization Program.               

            AUL offers, though some variable annuity and variable life
              contracts, asset allocation programs that may constitute the
 provision of investment advice under SEC rules.

       Under these programs, AUL has developed several asset
           allocation models, each based on different profiles of an
                 investor's willingness to accept investment risk. If the client
            decides to subscribe to the Portfolio Optimization service
                 initial premiums or Variable Account Value, as applicable, will
               be allocated to the Investment Options according to the model
               selected. Subsequent Purchase Payments, if allowed under your
Contract, will also be allocated accordingly. 

                 AUL will serve as your investment Advisor for the service, with
                all associated fiduciary responsibilities, solely for purposes
         of development of the Portfolio Optimization Models and
         periodic updates of the Models. Each model is evaluated
          annually to assess whether the combination of Investment
              Options within the model should be changed to better seek to
               optimize the potential return for the level of risk tolerance
               intended for the model. As a result of the periodic analysis,
                each model may change and Investment Options may be added to a
               model (including Investment Options not currently available),
    or Investment Options may be deleted from a model.

                 When AUL updates the models, it will send written notice of the
           updated models at least 30 days in advance of the date it
              intends the updated version of the model to be effective. If
             the client takes not action, the Variable Account Value (or
            subsequent Premiums, if applicable) will be reallocated in
                accordance with the updated model automatically. If the client
               does not wish to accept the changes to the selected model, he
             or she can change to a different model or withdraw from the
       Portfolio Optimization service by providing notice to
              AUL. Some of the riders available under the Contract require
           you to participate in an asset allocation service. If the
        client purchases any of these riders, such riders will
          terminate if you withdraw from Portfolio Optimization or
             allocate any portion of your subsequent Premiums or Account
              Value to an Investment Option that is not currently included
        in your Model (as more fully described in each rider).

* of applicant                      

II 7.(A)(B)(C)   AUL is a stock life insurance company existing under the laws  
                of the State of Indiana. AUL primarily conducts a conventional
           life insurance, health insurance, reinsurance and annuity
          business. Applicant spends approximately 90% of its time
conducting these activities.                  

II 8.C(1)        OneAmerica Securities, Inc.(Formerly known as: AUL Equity Sales
         Corporation), a registered broker-dealer located at One
                American Square, Indianapolis, Indiana 46206 is a wholly owned
        subsidiary of AUL is the distributor of all registered
products offered by AUL.                      

II 8.c(2)        See Answer provided in ll 1.A of this Schedule F.              

II 12.A (1)&(2)  The Board of Directors has adopted investment objectives for   
          each of the portfolios. Additionally, the portfolios are
         subject to certain investment restrictions. Neither the
              investment objectives nor the investment restrictions may be
            changed without a majority vote of the shareholders of the
        affected Portfolio. The applicant has the authority to
           determine, without obtaining specific client consent, the
              amount and type of securities to be bought or sold, provided
                that the investment objectives and investment restrictions are
followed.                                     

II 12.A (3)&(4)  In executing transactions, the Adviser will attempt to obtain  
             the best execution for a Portfolio taking into account such
      factors as price (including the applicable brokerage
                commission or dollar spread), size of order, the nature of the
             market for the security, the timing of the transaction, the
       reputation, experience and financial stability of the
         broker-dealer involved, the quality of the service, the
           difficulty of execution and operational facilities of the
              firms involved, and the firms risk in positioning a block of
           securities. In effecting purchases and sales of portfolio
                securities in transactions on national stock exchanges for the
               account of a Portfolio, the Adviser may pay higher commission
              rates than the lowest available when the Adviser believes it
               is reasonable to do so in light of the value of the brokerage
               and research services provided by the broker-dealer effecting
                the transaction, as described below. In the case of securities
              trade on the over-the-counter markets, there is generally no
          stated commission, but the price includes an undisclosed
commission or mark-up.

II.9.E           Some securities considered for investment by the Fund's        
              Portfolios may also be appropriate for other accounts served
               by the Adviser, including the Adviser's general account. If a
               purchase or sale of securities consistent with the Investment
           policies of a Portfolio and one or more of these accounts
          served by the Adviser is considered at or about the same
               time, transactions in such securities will be allocated among
         the Portfolios and accounts in a manner deemed fair and
           reasonable by the Adviser. Although there is no specified
       formula for allocating such transactions, the various
                 allocation methods used by the Adviser, and the results of such
           allocations, are subject to periodic review by the Fund's
        Adviser and Board of Directors affiliates receive such
services.

Article  IX,  Section  1  of  the  Second  Amended  and  Restated   Articles  of
Incorporation of American United Life Insurance Company(R) provides as follows: 

(a) Coverage.  The Corporation shall indemnify as a matter of right every person
made a party to a proceeding because such person (an "Indemnitee") is or was:   

(i)  a member of the Board of Directors of the Corporation,           

(ii) an officer of the Corporation, or                                

     (iii)while  a  director  or  officer  of the  Corporation,  serving  at the
          Corporation's  request  as  a  director,  officer,  partner,  trustee,
          member,  manager,  employee,  or agent of another  foreign or domestic
          corporation,  limited liability company,  partnership,  joint venture,
          trust, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise,  whether for profit
or not,                                                     

Notwithstanding  the foregoing,  it must be determined in the specific case that
indemnification  of the Indemnitee is permissible in the  circumstances  because
the Indemnitee has met the standard of conduct for indemnification  specified in
Indiana Code 27-1-7.5-8 (or any successor provision).  The Corporation shall pay
for or reimburse the reasonable expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in connection
with any such proceeding in advance of final  disposition  thereof in accordance
with the  procedures  and subject to the  conditions  specified  in Indiana Code
27-1-7.5-10 (or any successor  provision).  The Corporation shall indemnify as a
matter  of right an  Indemnitee  who is  wholly  successful,  on the  merits  or
otherwise,  in the defense of any such proceeding,  against reasonable  expenses
incurred  by the  Indemnitee  in  connection  with the  proceeding  without  the
requirement  of a  determination  as set  forth in the  first  sentence  of this
paragraph.                                                                      

(b) Determination. Upon demand by a person for indemnification or advancement of
expenses,  as the case may be, the  Corporation  shall  expeditiously  determine
whether the person is entitled  thereto in accordance  with this Article and the
procedures specified in Indiana Code 27-1-7.5-12 (or any successor provision).  

(c) Effective Date. The indemnification  provided under this Article shall apply
to any proceeding  arising from acts or omissions  occurring before or after the
adoption of this Article.

Unit values apply only to the specific annuity product listed, and should not be used by investors who hold an interest in Putnam Variable Trust funds through a different annuity or other variable product.
Money market funds are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other governmental agency. Although these funds seek to maintain a constant share price of $1.00, it is possible to lose money by investing in these funds.
For Putnam VT Growth and Income Fund, VT Growth Opportunities Fund, VT New Opportunities Fund and VT Voyager Fund, recent performance benefited from receipt of an Enron Class Action Settlement pertaining to investments made prior to 2002.
Data is historical. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. More recent returns may be less or more than those shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, and you may have a gain or a loss when you sell your units.
Returns shown for the subaccounts for periods before their inception are derived from the historical performance of the underlying fund, adjusted to reflect the mortality, expense risk, and surrender charges applicable to this product and do not factor in the annual $30 contract maintenance fee. Additional riders and options for insurance-related charges will increase expenses and lower returns. Please see the prospectus for details. For a portion of the period, subaccounts may have limited expenses, without which returns would have been lower.
Variable annuities are long-term investments designed for retirement purposes. Putnam Hartford products are flexible-premium variable annuities issued by Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company, Simsbury, CT.
Putnam Allstate variable annuities are flexible-premium deferred variable annuities issued by Allstate Life Insurance Company (Allstate Life); underwritten by Allstate Distributors, L.L.C., both of Northbrook, IL; and sold through registered representatives or bank employees who are licensed insurance agents. Please check for availability in your specific state.
These policies have limitations and are sold by prospectus only. The prospectus contains details on the variable annuity, the subaccounts, contract features, fees, expenses, and other pertinent information.
For a prospectus containing this and other information for any variable annuity or variable life product that invests in Putnam Variable Trust funds, contact your financial advisor or the applicable insurance firm for a contract prospectus and prospectus for the underlying funds. You may call Hartford at 1-800-521-0538 or Allstate at 1-800-390-1277. Read the prospectuses carefully before investing. If you are a financial advisor, call Putnam Dealer Marketing Services at 1-800-354-4000.
For the most recent month-end performance, please call Hartford at 1-800-521-0538 or Allstate at 1-800-390-1277.
