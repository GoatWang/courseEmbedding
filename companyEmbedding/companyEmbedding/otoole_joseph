Search results are sorted by a combination of factors to give you a set of choices in response to your search criteria. These factors are similar to those you might use to determine which business to select from a local Yellow Pages directory, including proximity to where you are searching, expertise in the specific services or products you need, and comprehensive business information to help evaluate a business's suitability for you. “Preferred” listings, or those with featured website buttons, indicate YP advertisers who directly provide information about their businesses to help consumers make more informed buying decisions. YP advertisers receive higher placement in the default ordering of search results and may appear in sponsored listings on the top, side, or bottom of the search results page.Sort:DefaultDefaultDistanceRatingName (A - Z)Sponsored LinksAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection1. O'Toole Joseph F DR59 Waterfront DrPittsburgh, PA 15222(412) 323-2433Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection2. Aracri Joseph F DO969 Greentree RdPittsburgh, PA 15220(412) 922-5250Physicians & SurgeonsOptometristsWebsiteAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection3. Rodkey Jr, Joseph F435 6th AvePittsburgh, PA 15219(412) 288-7206AttorneysAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection4. Butcher Joseph F AttyUsx Towers TowerPittsburgh, PA 15219(412) 281-8000AttorneysGeneral Practice AttorneysBusinesses in related categories to Physicians & SurgeonsAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your health collection!Error when adding to health collectionThis business was removed from the health collection5. Family Foot Center2526 Monroeville BlvdMonroeville, PA 15146(412) 824-3131Physicians & SurgeonsWebsiteDirectionsMore InfoAdd to mybookRemove from mybookAdded to your services collection!Error when adding to services collectionThis business was removed from the services collection6. Stiegel Robert M MD(4)BBB Rating: A+701 5th StBeaver, PA 15009(724) 888-3221Physicians & Surgeons, DermatologyWebsiteDirectionsJust awful!
