What is Military Family Relief Program (MFRP)?

If you or your spouse is called to full-time active military service by the President of the United States or the Governor of California during a time of declared national or state emergency or war, you may apply for a 180-day period shut-off protection for residential water service. The MFRP only defers the time of payment of all water charges and does not waive or cancel them.
To apply for the MFRP at your residence, please fill out this application and submit it to the Golden State Water Company. You will receive the MFRP shutoff protection benefit after Golden State Water Company receives, verifies and approves your completed and signed application.
If you need help filling out the application, or would like more information about the program, please call Golden State Water Company 24-hour customer service center at 1-800-999-4033.
What are the Benefits?

A 180-day shut off protection period.
Repayment plan that allows payment of past due amounts.
No late payment fees or interest charges imposed during the period of active military service or the repayment period.

What are the Qualifications?
To qualify for the MFRP, I understand:

I am a residential customer served by Golden State Water Company.
The water utility bill is in my name.
I must provide a copy of the activation or deployment order that specifies the duration of the active duty status.
I must notify Golden State Water Company if the active duty status is either shortened or extended.
I must provide Golden State Water Company written notice that includes the date of service termination and a valid forwarding address if I move from the residence.
I must provide a self-certified statement that my legal dependent(s), if any, occupy the residence.

Apply now for the Military Family Relief Program.

Golden State Water Co. to Host Water Awareness Celebration


Share: Facebook Twitter Google Plus LinkedIn In celebration of Water Awareness Month, Golden State Water Co. (GSWC) will host the Water Awareness Celebration, a free and fun water education event. The celebration is slated for Saturday, May 20 from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. at Palms Park, Lakewood, Calif. 

The celebration, in its 11th year, is a community event for the whole family featuring food, musical entertainment, water and environmental games, prizes (including t-shirts designed by GSWC employees and their families), water conservation information, clowns, face painting and a GSWC information booth. Other agencies participating in the event include the California Water Association, Central Basin Municipal Water District, Los Angeles County Fire Department, Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, Santiago Canyon College, City of Lakewood Parks and Recreation and Water Replenishment District of Southern California. 

Attendees at the event will learn from where their drinking water comes, how their water is monitored and tested to ensure provision of the highest quality of water, reasons why they should conserve this precious resource and what they can do to become good stewards of the environment—all in a fun and interactive way. 

The celebration is a community-based event featuring local businesses and organizations. All organizations have come together with the common goal of water education and conservation. Last year’s event drew more than 1,200 participants.

Complaint

Posted: 
10/29/2015


Summary: 
I am attempting to file a complaint about local businesses who water EVERY day Monday-Friday.  


Resolution Sought: 
Have the business cease and desist watering on the days that they are NOT permitted to do so.


Detail: 
I am attempting to file a complaint about local businesses who water EVERY day Monday-Friday.  The businesses are Super 8 Motel, 170 Coolwater Lane, Barstow, CA  92311, Days Inn, 1590 Coolwater Lane, Barstow, CA  92311 and the vacant lot at 1890 Main Street, Barstow, CA  92311.  My husband and I walk every morning Mon-Fri and the water has been on at both Coolwater Lane locations and we have noticed the vacant dirt lot at 1890 Main Street being "watered" on two separate occasions.  It is my understanding that the watering restrictions apply to businesses as well as residences so I would like to see the watering stopped except for the "day" it is allowed.  Most residences we see have dead grass and some business do as well...the rules should be followed by everyone!!!

Response: 
This is in response to complaint # (98794192) you received from (Virginia Andrew).
Golden State Water Company (GSWC) values its customers and responds promptly to all concerns. We were one of the first water utilities in the state to establish a 24-Hour Customer Service Center toll-free number: 1-800-999-4033. Customers can speak to a customer service representative anytime, 24 hours a day. We also have an award-winning customer website, www.gswater.com, which provides customers information about their water service, billing, water quality, water-use efficiency, and more. GSWC has procedures in place for responding to customer complaints. After reviewing the complaint you forwarded to us, we have determined we followed all of our procedures. We can’t provide you details about our response due to customer privacy issues. As an investor-owned water company, GSWC is regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).  If a customer is not satisfied with how the issue was resolved, their next step is to contact the CPUC, which has its own complaint resolution process. This process is described at www.cpuc.ca.gov.
Additionally, each customer bill contains this information about how to contact the CPUC regarding a dispute.  Customers can also write the CPUC at:
Public Utilities Commission
505 Van Ness Avenue
San Francisco, CA 94102
It is our goal not to have any CPUC complaints, so we work hard to address customer issues in a timely manner and to the customer’s satisfaction.  We will be contacting the customer again to determine if there is a way to provide them with a more satisfying outcome to this issue.

Complaint Resolution Index (CRI) Explanation



The Complaint Resolution Index (CRI) is an indicator on how responsive a company is in addressing and resolving customer complaints brought to their attention by BCA. If they are considering doing business with the company, consumers can use this indicator to forecast the likelihood of having their issues addressed if a problem arises. CRI measures the company's customer satisfaction abilities through BCA’s complaint mediation process.
A variety of factors are considered when calculating CRI. This includes how quickly a company responds to complaints, the number of complaints against a company, whether the company addressed complaint allegations, and the outcome of the complaints. CRI is just a subset of the overall rating for the company. Consumers are encouraged to take into consideration the company's CRI, their overall BCA letter rating and other relevant information about the company so they can make a well-informed purchasing decision.
