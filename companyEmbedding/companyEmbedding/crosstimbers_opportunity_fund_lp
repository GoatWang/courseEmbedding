Crosstimbers



























Crosstimbers


Capital Group, LLC







Crosstimbers makes direct investments in compelling private equity and project finance opportunities. We source proprietary deals from our network, structure them for mutual benefit, and actively manage their growth.





Approach

Source

Unlike traditional private equity funds we don’t rely upon deal brokers or auction processes to source potential investments. Rather, through our established network of family offices, regional and national lenders, service providers, and other executives, owners, and entrepreneurs we enjoy a robust pipeline of proprietary investment opportunities. By originating deals directly, and avoiding auctions and their abbreviated timelines, we have time to perform deep diligence alongside the owner/operator and to develop trust and rapport outside the restrictions imposed by a formal process.


Structure

We believe that the best way to protect and grow resources is through mutually beneficial partnerships with others. Therefore, our investment structures place heavy emphasis on properly aligning incentives. We require that our management teams co-invest meaningful capital alongside us, and that their success be linked to ours through shared participation in the value that is created after our capital has been returned. We also focus on down-side protection. The majority of our investments will be structured with a liquidation preference and to ensure that our invested capital initially goes onto a company’s balance sheet, not in the pocket of its management team.


Manage

Engaged partnership is a central tenet of our investment strategy. We desire to bring more to our portfolio companies than mere capital, complementing the skill sets of exceptional entrepreneurs to build lasting, valuable companies. We have a history, throughout our prior investments, of working alongside management teams to inform strategy, improve operations, scale for growth, evolve capital structures, and position portfolio companies for successful exits.




Investments

We evaluate each opportunity sourced from our network against a four-faceted framework to ensure its suitability.


We focus on making growth equity investments—that is, investments in companies that have an established product or service, growing revenue, and positive cash flow.
We invest in smaller rather than larger companies because we believe that smaller companies tend to develop faster, present more opportunities to add value, and benefit asymmetrically from valuation multiple expansion as they grow.
We look for companies with hard assets that provide underpinning collateral value in downside scenarios.
We seek strong management teams with proven business models.

A new Houston-based private equity fund has closed $49.1 million in funding, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Crosstimbers Capital LLC disclosed Nov. 30 it raised the capital under its Crosstimbers Opportunity Fund LP. There were 36 investors in the fund, according to the filing.

Crosstimbers declined to comment.
Founded in 2016, Crosstimbers Capital is led by Trevor Brock and David Hollon. The two used to work at family office private equity group Brock Capital LLC, according to the Crosstimbers website. Brock and Hollon also brought on at least two other Brock Capital employees to start the fund.




Crosstimbers lists itself as a private equity fund focusing on smaller companies that have an ability to scale with an established product or service. It does not identify a specific industry to invest in.
There's been a flurry of private equity-related deals in the second half of 2016. Rubicon International Oilfield Holdings made three acquisitions this year. Paul Hobby's private equity fund Genesis Park LP acquired Texas Monthly with plans to expand its digital and events offerings. It recently added new leadership to the staff, as well.
And, Five Point Capital Partners LLC relocated its headquarters to CityCentre and plans to hire as it ramps up its portfolio activity.
