	The Company believes net service revenue (NSR) best reflects the value of services provided and is the most meaningful indicator of revenue performance.
















	(2)






	TRC presents EBITDA because it believes that it is a useful tool for the Company, its lenders and its investors to measure the Company’s ability to meet debt service, capital expenditure and working capital requirements. As used in the presentation, EBITDA is operating income plus depreciation and amortization.
















	(3)






	Excludes acquisition and integration expenses of


	$1.6 million


	 and


	$3.7 million


	 for the three and nine months ended


	March 25, 2016


	, respectively, and a goodwill impairment charge of $24.5 million for the three months and nine months ended March 25, 2016. For a complete reconciliation of the Company’s non-GAAP results, please see the associated reconciliation tables, which are posted on the Company’s website.












	“Our third quarter results were driven by robust demand in the majority of our markets. NSR was $128.7 million, up 6% from $121.3 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase was driven primarily by large capital projects in our Power segment, including a significant program management project in California,” said Chris Vincze, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “Our Infrastructure segment also contributed to NSR growth, driven by transportation-related spending associated with several large public-private partnership projects. Our strong topline performance drove operating income of $7.0 million, net income of $4.5 million and EBITDA of $11.5 million.”

	Forward-Looking Statements




	Certain statements in this press release may be forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as "may," "expects," "plans," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," or other words of similar import. You should consider statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss TRC’s future expectations, contain projections of the Company’s future results of operations or of its financial condition, or state other "forward-looking" information. TRC believes that it is important to communicate its future expectations to its investors. However, there may be events in the future that the Company is not able to accurately predict or control and that may cause its actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in its forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from those discussed as a result of various factors, including, but not limited to, circumstances which could create large cash outflows, such as contract losses, litigation, uncollectible receivables and income tax assessments; regulatory uncertainty; the availability of funding for government projects; the level of demand for TRC’s services; product acceptance; industry-wide competitive factors; the ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel; the availability and adequacy of insurance; capital availability and project investment by TRC’s clients; and general political or economic conditions. Furthermore, market trends are subject to changes, which could adversely affect future results. See the risk factors and additional discussion in TRC’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, and other factors included from time to time in the Company’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
