Assets and holdings[edit]




Husky Gas Station, Downtown Edmonton, Alberta.


At 2015 year-end, Husky Energy had total proved reserves before royalties of 1.3 billion boe and probable reserves of 1.6 billion boe. In 2015 its reserves replacement ratio was 166 percent (136 percent including economic factors), reflecting new additions from heavy oil thermal projects, the Sunrise Energy Project, the Liwan Gas Project and the Company's natural gas fields offshore Indonesia.[11] It owns approximately 490 retail stations in Canada.[10]
Husky is the operator of the White Rose field and a partner in the Terra Nova project in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin offshore Newfoundland. Exploration work is underway at the Bay du Nord discovery area in the Flemish Pass, with partner Statoil.
The Company also owns a 40 percent interest in the Wenchang project offshore China, located near the mouth of the Pearl River. The remaining 60 percent of the project is owned by the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). Husky is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.
In terms of refined products facilities, Husky owns and operates the Lloydminster Heavy Oil Upgrader in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, the Asphalt Refinery in Lloydminster, Alberta, the Prince George Refinery in Prince George, British Columbia, the Lima Refinery in Lima, Ohio and is a 50 percent owner with BP of a refinery in Toledo, Ohio. Husky also operates the Husky Lloydminster Ethanol Plant and the Minnedosa Ethanol Plant.
A substantial portion of Husky's property and operations base has come from its acquisition of Renaissance Energy. In 2003, it also purchased the Canadian unit of the American-based Marathon Oil Corporation.
Corporate history[edit]
Now a publicly traded Canadian company with global interests, Husky Energy was founded in 1938 in Cody, Wyoming, in the United States, as the Husky Refining Company. Its primary founder was Glenn Nielsen. The first refinery was built in Cody, with a second constructed later in Riverton, Wyoming. In 1946, the Company relocated to Canada, with the Riverton refinery moved to Lloydminster, Alberta to take advantage of the expanding asphalt and heavy oil opportunities in the area. A wholly owned subsidiary, Husky Oil and Refining Ltd., was created and headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The Cody refinery continued operations well into the 1970s, producing primarily asphalt. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there were periodic rumors floating around Cody that the refinery would be reopened by a variety of different companies. One of the more persistent rumors was the impending purchase and reactivation of the refinery by Flying J.[citation needed] This never happened, however, and the entire refinery was finally razed in the late 1990s.
In 1991, Li Ka-shing and Hutchison Whampoa acquired controlling ownership of Husky.[12]
In 1998 Husky purchased Mohawk Oil, the largest independent chain of filling stations in Western Canada.[13] Mohawk continues as a banner of filling stations within the Husky company.
Operations[edit]
Husky Energy's operations are divided into two business segments: Upstream and Downstream.
The Upstream division focuses on oil and gas exploration and extraction. In addition to its existing producing assets and opportunities in Heavy Oil and Western Canada, the company has identified three pillars for growth: the Asia Pacific Region, the Oil Sands and the Atlantic Region.
Its Heavy Oil business include seven thermal developments in Saskatchewan, with three additional projects anticipated to be online by the end of 2016.
The Company's transition of its Western Canada portfolio includes a focus on resource plays.
In the Asia Pacific Region, Husky’s Liwan Gas Project in the South China Sea began production in 2014.[7] Husky is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.[14]
Husky has a portfolio of oil sands leases, encompassing some 2,500 square kilometres in the Fort McMurray region of northern Alberta. Its Sunrise Energy Project achieved first production in early 2015 and supports online applicants.[8]
Husky is using Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage technology at Sunrise, where bitumen is heated with steam to reduce its viscosity. When the liquid becomes more fluid, it is pumped to the surface and back to the central facility.
The White Rose field (located offshore Newfoundland in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin) includes two production wells at South White Rose that came online in 2015. Exploration work is underway at the Bay du Nord discovery area in the Flemish Pass, with partner Statoil.
Husky has managed the terminal operations for Western Canada Select (WCS)—one of North America's largest heavy crude oil streams— since it came on stream in 2004.[14]
Downstream[edit]
Husky Lloydminster Upgrader[edit]
The Lloydminster Upgrader, in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, converts heavy oil to a high-quality, low sulphur synthetic oil.
Husky Lloydminster Refinery[edit]
Husky's asphalt refinery, in Lloydminster, Alberta, produces more than 30 different types and grades of road asphalt.
Minnedosa Ethanol Plant[edit]
Husky's Ethanol Plant in Minnedosa, Manitoba has been producing ethanol to be blended into gasoline since 1981. In 2007 it was expanded and produces about 130 million litres of ethanol per year.[15]
Lloydminster Ethanol Plant[edit]
The Husky Lloydminster Ethanol Plant came online in 2006 and produces 130 million litres of ethanol per year. In Canada ethanol is blended into gasoline. Feedstock for the plant is mainly non-food feed-grade wheat purchased locally. The plant can also produce Corn ethanol.
Prince George Refinery[edit]
Husky owns and operates the Prince George Refinery in Prince George, British Columbia. The refinery provides unleaded gasoline, seasonal diesel fuels, mixed propane and butane, and heavy fuel oil. The refinery's capacity is 12,000 bpd.
Lima Refinery[edit]
Like a number of other Midwest refiners, Husky was revamping its Lima, Ohio refinery to process Western Canadian Select, (WCS) a heavier but less expensive crude oil. Since 2012 "Lima has run over 60,000 bpd of Canadian crude, but only about 3,000 bpd of that would be particularly heavy with an API gravity below 30."[16] In early January 2015 an explosion damaged the refinery's 26,000-bpd isocracker unit. Later that year Husky announced that, given the low price of oil, it would postpone its USD$300 million crude oil flexibility project.[16] The project will process up to 40,000 bpd of WCS.[16] Work is expected to begin on the first stage of the crude oil flexibility project during a planned maintenance turnaround in the first quarter of 2016.
BP-Husky Toledo Refinery[edit]
Husky and BP arranged a Joint Venture (JV) in 2008 in order to develop and process Alberta bitumen through which Husky acquired a 50 percent share[17] in the 155,000-bpd BP-Husky Toledo Refinery in Oregon, Ohio and BP acquired a 50 percent share of the Husky-operated Sunrise field in Alberta.[9][18][17] This refinery has been upgraded with a coker and is processing bitumen from Sunrise.
Retail operations[edit]
In December 2009, Husky Energy announced that it has entered into an agreement with Suncor Energy Inc. and Suncor Energy Products Inc. to purchase 98 retail outlets in the Ontario market.[19] Husky acquired 68 stations that were branded Sunoco and 30 stations that were branded Petro-Canada. The Company operates a total of about 490 retail stations in Canada.
Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Husky Energy are: Victor Li, Canning Fok, Frank Sixt, Asim Ghosh, Rob Peabody, Stephen Bradley, Martin Glynn, Poh Chan Koh, Eva Kwok, Stanley Kwok, Frederick Ma, George Magnus, Neil McGee, Colin Russel, Wayne Shaw and William Shurniak.
Tommy Douglas served as a director of Husky Oil after his retirement from politics in 1979.
The current Chief Executive Officer and President of Husky is Rob Peabody. Peabody assumed the role in December 2016, taking over the position from Asim Ghosh, who had served as the CEO since 2010.[20]

Husky Oil headquarters in Calgary


Husky Energy Inc. is one of Canada’s largest integrated energy companies, headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. Its common shares are publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol HSE. The Company operates in Western and Atlantic Canada, the United States and the Asia Pacific Region, with Upstream and Downstream business segments. Husky Energy is controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing who owns a majority share of approximately 70% according to Bloomberg[4] and Financial Post[5] data.
Husky's foundation is in Heavy Oil and Western Canada,[6] where it has conventional oil and natural gas assets, significant heavy oil production and downstream operations, including refineries, upgrading facilities and pipelines. The Company's three growth pillars are in the Asia Pacific Region, the Oil Sands and the Atlantic Region.
In the Asia Pacific Region, Husky’s Liwan Gas Project in the South China Sea achieved first production in 2014.[7] The Company is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.
Husky also has a portfolio of oil sands leases, encompassing some 2,500 square kilometres in the Fort McMurray region of northern Alberta. Its Sunrise Energy Project achieved first production in early 2015.[8]
In the Atlantic Region, off Canada's East Coast, the Company holds interests in 20 exploration licenses and producing properties at Terra Nova and White Rose. In the United States, the company owns a refinery in Lima, Ohio and holds a 50 percent ownership interest with BP in the BP-Husky Toledo Refinery in Oregon, Ohio.[9] The company employs approximately 5,500 people (as of 2015),[10] has approximately $33.1 billion in assets[2] and produced an average of 346,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015,[11] making it one of Canada's largest energy companies.

Assets and holdings[edit]




Husky Gas Station, Downtown Edmonton, Alberta.


At 2015 year-end, Husky Energy had total proved reserves before royalties of 1.3 billion boe and probable reserves of 1.6 billion boe. In 2015 its reserves replacement ratio was 166 percent (136 percent including economic factors), reflecting new additions from heavy oil thermal projects, the Sunrise Energy Project, the Liwan Gas Project and the Company's natural gas fields offshore Indonesia.[11] It owns approximately 490 retail stations in Canada.[10]
Husky is the operator of the White Rose field and a partner in the Terra Nova project in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin offshore Newfoundland. Exploration work is underway at the Bay du Nord discovery area in the Flemish Pass, with partner Statoil.
The Company also owns a 40 percent interest in the Wenchang project offshore China, located near the mouth of the Pearl River. The remaining 60 percent of the project is owned by the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). Husky is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.
In terms of refined products facilities, Husky owns and operates the Lloydminster Heavy Oil Upgrader in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, the Asphalt Refinery in Lloydminster, Alberta, the Prince George Refinery in Prince George, British Columbia, the Lima Refinery in Lima, Ohio and is a 50 percent owner with BP of a refinery in Toledo, Ohio. Husky also operates the Husky Lloydminster Ethanol Plant and the Minnedosa Ethanol Plant.
A substantial portion of Husky's property and operations base has come from its acquisition of Renaissance Energy. In 2003, it also purchased the Canadian unit of the American-based Marathon Oil Corporation.
Corporate history[edit]
Now a publicly traded Canadian company with global interests, Husky Energy was founded in 1938 in Cody, Wyoming, in the United States, as the Husky Refining Company. Its primary founder was Glenn Nielsen. The first refinery was built in Cody, with a second constructed later in Riverton, Wyoming. In 1946, the Company relocated to Canada, with the Riverton refinery moved to Lloydminster, Alberta to take advantage of the expanding asphalt and heavy oil opportunities in the area. A wholly owned subsidiary, Husky Oil and Refining Ltd., was created and headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The Cody refinery continued operations well into the 1970s, producing primarily asphalt. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there were periodic rumors floating around Cody that the refinery would be reopened by a variety of different companies. One of the more persistent rumors was the impending purchase and reactivation of the refinery by Flying J.[citation needed] This never happened, however, and the entire refinery was finally razed in the late 1990s.
In 1991, Li Ka-shing and Hutchison Whampoa acquired controlling ownership of Husky.[12]
In 1998 Husky purchased Mohawk Oil, the largest independent chain of filling stations in Western Canada.[13] Mohawk continues as a banner of filling stations within the Husky company.
Operations[edit]
Husky Energy's operations are divided into two business segments: Upstream and Downstream.
The Upstream division focuses on oil and gas exploration and extraction. In addition to its existing producing assets and opportunities in Heavy Oil and Western Canada, the company has identified three pillars for growth: the Asia Pacific Region, the Oil Sands and the Atlantic Region.
Its Heavy Oil business include seven thermal developments in Saskatchewan, with three additional projects anticipated to be online by the end of 2016.
The Company's transition of its Western Canada portfolio includes a focus on resource plays.
In the Asia Pacific Region, Husky’s Liwan Gas Project in the South China Sea began production in 2014.[7] Husky is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.[14]
Husky has a portfolio of oil sands leases, encompassing some 2,500 square kilometres in the Fort McMurray region of northern Alberta. Its Sunrise Energy Project achieved first production in early 2015 and supports online applicants.[8]
Husky is using Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage technology at Sunrise, where bitumen is heated with steam to reduce its viscosity. When the liquid becomes more fluid, it is pumped to the surface and back to the central facility.
The White Rose field (located offshore Newfoundland in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin) includes two production wells at South White Rose that came online in 2015. Exploration work is underway at the Bay du Nord discovery area in the Flemish Pass, with partner Statoil.
Husky has managed the terminal operations for Western Canada Select (WCS)—one of North America's largest heavy crude oil streams— since it came on stream in 2004.[14]
Downstream[edit]
Husky Lloydminster Upgrader[edit]
The Lloydminster Upgrader, in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, converts heavy oil to a high-quality, low sulphur synthetic oil.
Husky Lloydminster Refinery[edit]
Husky's asphalt refinery, in Lloydminster, Alberta, produces more than 30 different types and grades of road asphalt.
Minnedosa Ethanol Plant[edit]
Husky's Ethanol Plant in Minnedosa, Manitoba has been producing ethanol to be blended into gasoline since 1981. In 2007 it was expanded and produces about 130 million litres of ethanol per year.[15]
Lloydminster Ethanol Plant[edit]
The Husky Lloydminster Ethanol Plant came online in 2006 and produces 130 million litres of ethanol per year. In Canada ethanol is blended into gasoline. Feedstock for the plant is mainly non-food feed-grade wheat purchased locally. The plant can also produce Corn ethanol.
Prince George Refinery[edit]
Husky owns and operates the Prince George Refinery in Prince George, British Columbia. The refinery provides unleaded gasoline, seasonal diesel fuels, mixed propane and butane, and heavy fuel oil. The refinery's capacity is 12,000 bpd.
Lima Refinery[edit]
Like a number of other Midwest refiners, Husky was revamping its Lima, Ohio refinery to process Western Canadian Select, (WCS) a heavier but less expensive crude oil. Since 2012 "Lima has run over 60,000 bpd of Canadian crude, but only about 3,000 bpd of that would be particularly heavy with an API gravity below 30."[16] In early January 2015 an explosion damaged the refinery's 26,000-bpd isocracker unit. Later that year Husky announced that, given the low price of oil, it would postpone its USD$300 million crude oil flexibility project.[16] The project will process up to 40,000 bpd of WCS.[16] Work is expected to begin on the first stage of the crude oil flexibility project during a planned maintenance turnaround in the first quarter of 2016.
BP-Husky Toledo Refinery[edit]
Husky and BP arranged a Joint Venture (JV) in 2008 in order to develop and process Alberta bitumen through which Husky acquired a 50 percent share[17] in the 155,000-bpd BP-Husky Toledo Refinery in Oregon, Ohio and BP acquired a 50 percent share of the Husky-operated Sunrise field in Alberta.[9][18][17] This refinery has been upgraded with a coker and is processing bitumen from Sunrise.
Retail operations[edit]
In December 2009, Husky Energy announced that it has entered into an agreement with Suncor Energy Inc. and Suncor Energy Products Inc. to purchase 98 retail outlets in the Ontario market.[19] Husky acquired 68 stations that were branded Sunoco and 30 stations that were branded Petro-Canada. The Company operates a total of about 490 retail stations in Canada.
Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Husky Energy are: Victor Li, Canning Fok, Frank Sixt, Asim Ghosh, Rob Peabody, Stephen Bradley, Martin Glynn, Poh Chan Koh, Eva Kwok, Stanley Kwok, Frederick Ma, George Magnus, Neil McGee, Colin Russel, Wayne Shaw and William Shurniak.
Tommy Douglas served as a director of Husky Oil after his retirement from politics in 1979.
The current Chief Executive Officer and President of Husky is Rob Peabody. Peabody assumed the role in December 2016, taking over the position from Asim Ghosh, who had served as the CEO since 2010.[20]

In addition, the Upgrader also produced, as by-products of its upgrading operations, approximately 331 long tons/day of sulfur and 876 long tons/day of petroleum coke, as of December 31, 2016. These products are sold in Canadian and international markets.The Company's Canadian Refined Products operations include refining of light crude oil, manufacturing of fuel and fuel grade ethanol, manufacturing of asphalt products from heavy crude oil and acquisition by purchase and exchange of refined petroleum products.

Assets and holdings[edit]




Husky Gas Station, Downtown Edmonton, Alberta.


At 2015 year-end, Husky Energy had total proved reserves before royalties of 1.3 billion boe and probable reserves of 1.6 billion boe. In 2015 its reserves replacement ratio was 166 percent (136 percent including economic factors), reflecting new additions from heavy oil thermal projects, the Sunrise Energy Project, the Liwan Gas Project and the Company's natural gas fields offshore Indonesia.[11] It owns approximately 490 retail stations in Canada.[10]
Husky is the operator of the White Rose field and a partner in the Terra Nova project in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin offshore Newfoundland. Exploration work is underway at the Bay du Nord discovery area in the Flemish Pass, with partner Statoil.
The Company also owns a 40 percent interest in the Wenchang project offshore China, located near the mouth of the Pearl River. The remaining 60 percent of the project is owned by the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). Husky is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.
In terms of refined products facilities, Husky owns and operates the Lloydminster Heavy Oil Upgrader in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, the Asphalt Refinery in Lloydminster, Alberta, the Prince George Refinery in Prince George, British Columbia, the Lima Refinery in Lima, Ohio and is a 50 percent owner with BP of a refinery in Toledo, Ohio. Husky also operates the Husky Lloydminster Ethanol Plant and the Minnedosa Ethanol Plant.
A substantial portion of Husky's property and operations base has come from its acquisition of Renaissance Energy. In 2003, it also purchased the Canadian unit of the American-based Marathon Oil Corporation.
Corporate history[edit]
Now a publicly traded Canadian company with global interests, Husky Energy was founded in 1938 in Cody, Wyoming, in the United States, as the Husky Refining Company. Its primary founder was Glenn Nielsen. The first refinery was built in Cody, with a second constructed later in Riverton, Wyoming. In 1946, the Company relocated to Canada, with the Riverton refinery moved to Lloydminster, Alberta to take advantage of the expanding asphalt and heavy oil opportunities in the area. A wholly owned subsidiary, Husky Oil and Refining Ltd., was created and headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The Cody refinery continued operations well into the 1970s, producing primarily asphalt. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there were periodic rumors floating around Cody that the refinery would be reopened by a variety of different companies. One of the more persistent rumors was the impending purchase and reactivation of the refinery by Flying J.[citation needed] This never happened, however, and the entire refinery was finally razed in the late 1990s.
In 1991, Li Ka-shing and Hutchison Whampoa acquired controlling ownership of Husky.[12]
In 1998 Husky purchased Mohawk Oil, the largest independent chain of filling stations in Western Canada.[13] Mohawk continues as a banner of filling stations within the Husky company.
Operations[edit]
Husky Energy's operations are divided into two business segments: Upstream and Downstream.
The Upstream division focuses on oil and gas exploration and extraction. In addition to its existing producing assets and opportunities in Heavy Oil and Western Canada, the company has identified three pillars for growth: the Asia Pacific Region, the Oil Sands and the Atlantic Region.
Its Heavy Oil business include seven thermal developments in Saskatchewan, with three additional projects anticipated to be online by the end of 2016.
The Company's transition of its Western Canada portfolio includes a focus on resource plays.
In the Asia Pacific Region, Husky’s Liwan Gas Project in the South China Sea began production in 2014.[7] Husky is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.[14]
Husky has a portfolio of oil sands leases, encompassing some 2,500 square kilometres in the Fort McMurray region of northern Alberta. Its Sunrise Energy Project achieved first production in early 2015 and supports online applicants.[8]
Husky is using Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage technology at Sunrise, where bitumen is heated with steam to reduce its viscosity. When the liquid becomes more fluid, it is pumped to the surface and back to the central facility.
The White Rose field (located offshore Newfoundland in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin) includes two production wells at South White Rose that came online in 2015. Exploration work is underway at the Bay du Nord discovery area in the Flemish Pass, with partner Statoil.
Husky has managed the terminal operations for Western Canada Select (WCS)—one of North America's largest heavy crude oil streams— since it came on stream in 2004.[14]
Downstream[edit]
Husky Lloydminster Upgrader[edit]
The Lloydminster Upgrader, in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, converts heavy oil to a high-quality, low sulphur synthetic oil.
Husky Lloydminster Refinery[edit]
Husky's asphalt refinery, in Lloydminster, Alberta, produces more than 30 different types and grades of road asphalt.
Minnedosa Ethanol Plant[edit]
Husky's Ethanol Plant in Minnedosa, Manitoba has been producing ethanol to be blended into gasoline since 1981. In 2007 it was expanded and produces about 130 million litres of ethanol per year.[15]
Lloydminster Ethanol Plant[edit]
The Husky Lloydminster Ethanol Plant came online in 2006 and produces 130 million litres of ethanol per year. In Canada ethanol is blended into gasoline. Feedstock for the plant is mainly non-food feed-grade wheat purchased locally. The plant can also produce Corn ethanol.
Prince George Refinery[edit]
Husky owns and operates the Prince George Refinery in Prince George, British Columbia. The refinery provides unleaded gasoline, seasonal diesel fuels, mixed propane and butane, and heavy fuel oil. The refinery's capacity is 12,000 bpd.
Lima Refinery[edit]
Like a number of other Midwest refiners, Husky was revamping its Lima, Ohio refinery to process Western Canadian Select, (WCS) a heavier but less expensive crude oil. Since 2012 "Lima has run over 60,000 bpd of Canadian crude, but only about 3,000 bpd of that would be particularly heavy with an API gravity below 30."[16] In early January 2015 an explosion damaged the refinery's 26,000-bpd isocracker unit. Later that year Husky announced that, given the low price of oil, it would postpone its USD$300 million crude oil flexibility project.[16] The project will process up to 40,000 bpd of WCS.[16] Work is expected to begin on the first stage of the crude oil flexibility project during a planned maintenance turnaround in the first quarter of 2016.
BP-Husky Toledo Refinery[edit]
Husky and BP arranged a Joint Venture (JV) in 2008 in order to develop and process Alberta bitumen through which Husky acquired a 50 percent share[17] in the 155,000-bpd BP-Husky Toledo Refinery in Oregon, Ohio and BP acquired a 50 percent share of the Husky-operated Sunrise field in Alberta.[9][18][17] This refinery has been upgraded with a coker and is processing bitumen from Sunrise.
Retail operations[edit]
In December 2009, Husky Energy announced that it has entered into an agreement with Suncor Energy Inc. and Suncor Energy Products Inc. to purchase 98 retail outlets in the Ontario market.[19] Husky acquired 68 stations that were branded Sunoco and 30 stations that were branded Petro-Canada. The Company operates a total of about 490 retail stations in Canada.
Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Husky Energy are: Victor Li, Canning Fok, Frank Sixt, Asim Ghosh, Rob Peabody, Stephen Bradley, Martin Glynn, Poh Chan Koh, Eva Kwok, Stanley Kwok, Frederick Ma, George Magnus, Neil McGee, Colin Russel, Wayne Shaw and William Shurniak.
Tommy Douglas served as a director of Husky Oil after his retirement from politics in 1979.
The current Chief Executive Officer and President of Husky is Rob Peabody. Peabody assumed the role in December 2016, taking over the position from Asim Ghosh, who had served as the CEO since 2010.[20]

Husky has managed the terminal operations for Western Canada Select (WCS)—one of North America's largest heavy crude oil streams— since it came on stream in 2004.[14]
Downstream[edit]
Husky Lloydminster Upgrader[edit]
The Lloydminster Upgrader, in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, converts heavy oil to a high-quality, low sulphur synthetic oil.
Husky Lloydminster Refinery[edit]
Husky's asphalt refinery, in Lloydminster, Alberta, produces more than 30 different types and grades of road asphalt.
Minnedosa Ethanol Plant[edit]
Husky's Ethanol Plant in Minnedosa, Manitoba has been producing ethanol to be blended into gasoline since 1981. In 2007 it was expanded and produces about 130 million litres of ethanol per year.[15]
Lloydminster Ethanol Plant[edit]
The Husky Lloydminster Ethanol Plant came online in 2006 and produces 130 million litres of ethanol per year. In Canada ethanol is blended into gasoline. Feedstock for the plant is mainly non-food feed-grade wheat purchased locally. The plant can also produce Corn ethanol.
Prince George Refinery[edit]
Husky owns and operates the Prince George Refinery in Prince George, British Columbia. The refinery provides unleaded gasoline, seasonal diesel fuels, mixed propane and butane, and heavy fuel oil. The refinery's capacity is 12,000 bpd.
Lima Refinery[edit]
Like a number of other Midwest refiners, Husky was revamping its Lima, Ohio refinery to process Western Canadian Select, (WCS) a heavier but less expensive crude oil. Since 2012 "Lima has run over 60,000 bpd of Canadian crude, but only about 3,000 bpd of that would be particularly heavy with an API gravity below 30."[16] In early January 2015 an explosion damaged the refinery's 26,000-bpd isocracker unit. Later that year Husky announced that, given the low price of oil, it would postpone its USD$300 million crude oil flexibility project.[16] The project will process up to 40,000 bpd of WCS.[16] Work is expected to begin on the first stage of the crude oil flexibility project during a planned maintenance turnaround in the first quarter of 2016.
BP-Husky Toledo Refinery[edit]
Husky and BP arranged a Joint Venture (JV) in 2008 in order to develop and process Alberta bitumen through which Husky acquired a 50 percent share[17] in the 155,000-bpd BP-Husky Toledo Refinery in Oregon, Ohio and BP acquired a 50 percent share of the Husky-operated Sunrise field in Alberta.[9][18][17] This refinery has been upgraded with a coker and is processing bitumen from Sunrise.
Retail operations[edit]
In December 2009, Husky Energy announced that it has entered into an agreement with Suncor Energy Inc. and Suncor Energy Products Inc. to purchase 98 retail outlets in the Ontario market.[19] Husky acquired 68 stations that were branded Sunoco and 30 stations that were branded Petro-Canada. The Company operates a total of about 490 retail stations in Canada.
Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Husky Energy are: Victor Li, Canning Fok, Frank Sixt, Asim Ghosh, Rob Peabody, Stephen Bradley, Martin Glynn, Poh Chan Koh, Eva Kwok, Stanley Kwok, Frederick Ma, George Magnus, Neil McGee, Colin Russel, Wayne Shaw and William Shurniak.
Tommy Douglas served as a director of Husky Oil after his retirement from politics in 1979.
The current Chief Executive Officer and President of Husky is Rob Peabody. Peabody assumed the role in December 2016, taking over the position from Asim Ghosh, who had served as the CEO since 2010.[20]

Husky Oil headquarters in Calgary


Husky Energy Inc. is one of Canada’s largest integrated energy companies, headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. Its common shares are publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol HSE. The Company operates in Western and Atlantic Canada, the United States and the Asia Pacific Region, with Upstream and Downstream business segments. Husky Energy is controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing who owns a majority share of approximately 70% according to Bloomberg[4] and Financial Post[5] data.
Husky's foundation is in Heavy Oil and Western Canada,[6] where it has conventional oil and natural gas assets, significant heavy oil production and downstream operations, including refineries, upgrading facilities and pipelines. The Company's three growth pillars are in the Asia Pacific Region, the Oil Sands and the Atlantic Region.
In the Asia Pacific Region, Husky’s Liwan Gas Project in the South China Sea achieved first production in 2014.[7] The Company is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.
Husky also has a portfolio of oil sands leases, encompassing some 2,500 square kilometres in the Fort McMurray region of northern Alberta. Its Sunrise Energy Project achieved first production in early 2015.[8]
In the Atlantic Region, off Canada's East Coast, the Company holds interests in 20 exploration licenses and producing properties at Terra Nova and White Rose. In the United States, the company owns a refinery in Lima, Ohio and holds a 50 percent ownership interest with BP in the BP-Husky Toledo Refinery in Oregon, Ohio.[9] The company employs approximately 5,500 people (as of 2015),[10] has approximately $33.1 billion in assets[2] and produced an average of 346,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015,[11] making it one of Canada's largest energy companies.

Assets and holdings[edit]




Husky Gas Station, Downtown Edmonton, Alberta.


At 2015 year-end, Husky Energy had total proved reserves before royalties of 1.3 billion boe and probable reserves of 1.6 billion boe. In 2015 its reserves replacement ratio was 166 percent (136 percent including economic factors), reflecting new additions from heavy oil thermal projects, the Sunrise Energy Project, the Liwan Gas Project and the Company's natural gas fields offshore Indonesia.[11] It owns approximately 490 retail stations in Canada.[10]
Husky is the operator of the White Rose field and a partner in the Terra Nova project in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin offshore Newfoundland. Exploration work is underway at the Bay du Nord discovery area in the Flemish Pass, with partner Statoil.
The Company also owns a 40 percent interest in the Wenchang project offshore China, located near the mouth of the Pearl River. The remaining 60 percent of the project is owned by the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). Husky is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.
In terms of refined products facilities, Husky owns and operates the Lloydminster Heavy Oil Upgrader in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, the Asphalt Refinery in Lloydminster, Alberta, the Prince George Refinery in Prince George, British Columbia, the Lima Refinery in Lima, Ohio and is a 50 percent owner with BP of a refinery in Toledo, Ohio. Husky also operates the Husky Lloydminster Ethanol Plant and the Minnedosa Ethanol Plant.
A substantial portion of Husky's property and operations base has come from its acquisition of Renaissance Energy. In 2003, it also purchased the Canadian unit of the American-based Marathon Oil Corporation.
Corporate history[edit]
Now a publicly traded Canadian company with global interests, Husky Energy was founded in 1938 in Cody, Wyoming, in the United States, as the Husky Refining Company. Its primary founder was Glenn Nielsen. The first refinery was built in Cody, with a second constructed later in Riverton, Wyoming. In 1946, the Company relocated to Canada, with the Riverton refinery moved to Lloydminster, Alberta to take advantage of the expanding asphalt and heavy oil opportunities in the area. A wholly owned subsidiary, Husky Oil and Refining Ltd., was created and headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The Cody refinery continued operations well into the 1970s, producing primarily asphalt. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there were periodic rumors floating around Cody that the refinery would be reopened by a variety of different companies. One of the more persistent rumors was the impending purchase and reactivation of the refinery by Flying J.[citation needed] This never happened, however, and the entire refinery was finally razed in the late 1990s.
In 1991, Li Ka-shing and Hutchison Whampoa acquired controlling ownership of Husky.[12]
In 1998 Husky purchased Mohawk Oil, the largest independent chain of filling stations in Western Canada.[13] Mohawk continues as a banner of filling stations within the Husky company.
Operations[edit]
Husky Energy's operations are divided into two business segments: Upstream and Downstream.
The Upstream division focuses on oil and gas exploration and extraction. In addition to its existing producing assets and opportunities in Heavy Oil and Western Canada, the company has identified three pillars for growth: the Asia Pacific Region, the Oil Sands and the Atlantic Region.
Its Heavy Oil business include seven thermal developments in Saskatchewan, with three additional projects anticipated to be online by the end of 2016.
The Company's transition of its Western Canada portfolio includes a focus on resource plays.
In the Asia Pacific Region, Husky’s Liwan Gas Project in the South China Sea began production in 2014.[7] Husky is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.[14]
Husky has a portfolio of oil sands leases, encompassing some 2,500 square kilometres in the Fort McMurray region of northern Alberta. Its Sunrise Energy Project achieved first production in early 2015 and supports online applicants.[8]
Husky is using Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage technology at Sunrise, where bitumen is heated with steam to reduce its viscosity. When the liquid becomes more fluid, it is pumped to the surface and back to the central facility.
The White Rose field (located offshore Newfoundland in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin) includes two production wells at South White Rose that came online in 2015. Exploration work is underway at the Bay du Nord discovery area in the Flemish Pass, with partner Statoil.
Husky has managed the terminal operations for Western Canada Select (WCS)—one of North America's largest heavy crude oil streams— since it came on stream in 2004.[14]

Products - Husky Energy







The Company














Products







The Company markets crude oil, natural gas, natural gas liquids, asphalt, petroleum coke and sulphur. It markets and distributes gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, asphalt, lubricants and ancillary products.



Canada
Asphalt
Husky produces high-quality asphalt at its refinery in Lloydminster, Alberta, which operates year-round. Its products are premium quality and use modification processes and additives, such as polymers, to increase the life-cycle of projects.
Advancements in production development are supported by a research alliance with the University of Calgary.
Pounder Emulsions, a division of Husky, sells emulsified products, as well as a line of specialty road products and services. It has manufacturing plants in Kamloops, British Columbia, Edmonton and Lethbridge, Alberta, Lloydminster, Saskatoon and Yorkton, Saskatchewan and Winnipeg, Manitoba.
Crude Oil
Husky provides transportation, storage and various pricing options to third-party producers and end-user customers in North America and internationally. It ensures the Company’s upgrading and refining operations in Canada and the U.S. have best-price feedstock.
Dried Distillers Grain with Solubles
Dried Distillers Grain with Solubles is a byproduct of ethanol and sold as a high-protein feed supplement for livestock. More than 260,000 tonnes is produced annually by Husky’s two ethanol plants.
Gasoline
Husky sells fuel through its retail outlets, travel centres and bulk distributors, located from Vancouver Island through Ontario. Ethanol blends are available at most stations.
All grades of Husky gasoline and ethanol-blended gasoline contain a deposit-control additive package formulated to meet the requirements set out by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Ethanol
Ethanol is produced from wheat and/or corn and added to gasoline as a renewable, clean-burning fuel that contains oxygen. Adding oxygen to fuel results in more complete fuel combustion, which can reduce harmful tailpipe emissions. Gasoline containing up to 10 percent ethanol by volume is the most common form of ethanol-blended fuel and is covered by warranty by every automobile manufacturer.
Lubricants
Husky distributes Chevron-branded lubricants. For questions on technology, specifications and product availability, please contact 1-800-592-8838 or visit myhusky.ca.
Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs)
NGLs consist of propane, butanes, pentanes, natural gasoline and condensate recovered from natural gas at field facilities or at gas processing plants. These are fractionated into various components for market sale.
Natural Gas
Husky markets natural gas, a clean-burning fuel used for home heating, industrial heating and power, and in the manufacture of organic compounds found in many common household products and building materials.
The Company has storage services at Hussar, Alberta and East Cantaur, Saskatchewan, as well as contracted capacity. Hussar is connected to the NOVA pipeline system with access to all major export points and intra-Alberta markets. East Cantaur is connected to the TransGas pipeline system and the TransCanada mainline.
Petroleum Coke
Petroleum coke is sold for use in fuel boilers or cement kilns, as well as into the calcining market for use in the aluminum industry.
Sulphur
Sulphur is produced when sour natural gas and crude oil, containing hydrogen sulphide, is processed. It is used in fertilizer production, mining applications and to produce various chemicals. Husky markets its sulphur, as well as third-party production, directly to customers in North America and internationally.
U.S.
Husky Marketing & Supply Company
The Husky Marketing & Supply Company (HMSC) is based in Columbus, Ohio and sells all commercial products from Huskys refinery in Lima, Ohio, and Huskys share of the commercial products from the joint-venture BP-Husky Toledo Refinery in Toledo, Ohio.
HMSC purchases non-crude feedstocks for the Lima Refinery. The refined products include:

Gasoline
Ultra-low Sulfur Diesel
Jet fuel, military and commercial grade
Natural gas liquids (NGLs), including propane, butane and isobutane
Petchems

Benzene
Butane and Butylenes (BB) Mix

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

          Never miss a single piece of research, upgrade, downgrade or target price change by any analyst firm on any stock!

          Our mission is to unlock access to valuable research on stocks for all retail investors.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Husky Oil headquarters in Calgary


Husky Energy Inc. is one of Canada’s largest integrated energy companies, headquartered in Calgary, Alberta. Its common shares are publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol HSE. The Company operates in Western and Atlantic Canada, the United States and the Asia Pacific Region, with Upstream and Downstream business segments. Husky Energy is controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing who owns a majority share of approximately 70% according to Bloomberg[4] and Financial Post[5] data.
Husky's foundation is in Heavy Oil and Western Canada,[6] where it has conventional oil and natural gas assets, significant heavy oil production and downstream operations, including refineries, upgrading facilities and pipelines. The Company's three growth pillars are in the Asia Pacific Region, the Oil Sands and the Atlantic Region.
In the Asia Pacific Region, Husky’s Liwan Gas Project in the South China Sea achieved first production in 2014.[7] The Company is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.
Husky also has a portfolio of oil sands leases, encompassing some 2,500 square kilometres in the Fort McMurray region of northern Alberta. Its Sunrise Energy Project achieved first production in early 2015.[8]
In the Atlantic Region, off Canada's East Coast, the Company holds interests in 20 exploration licenses and producing properties at Terra Nova and White Rose. In the United States, the company owns a refinery in Lima, Ohio and holds a 50 percent ownership interest with BP in the BP-Husky Toledo Refinery in Oregon, Ohio.[9] The company employs approximately 5,500 people (as of 2015),[10] has approximately $33.1 billion in assets[2] and produced an average of 346,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2015,[11] making it one of Canada's largest energy companies.

Assets and holdings[edit]




Husky Gas Station, Downtown Edmonton, Alberta.


At 2015 year-end, Husky Energy had total proved reserves before royalties of 1.3 billion boe and probable reserves of 1.6 billion boe. In 2015 its reserves replacement ratio was 166 percent (136 percent including economic factors), reflecting new additions from heavy oil thermal projects, the Sunrise Energy Project, the Liwan Gas Project and the Company's natural gas fields offshore Indonesia.[11] It owns approximately 490 retail stations in Canada.[10]
Husky is the operator of the White Rose field and a partner in the Terra Nova project in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin offshore Newfoundland. Exploration work is underway at the Bay du Nord discovery area in the Flemish Pass, with partner Statoil.
The Company also owns a 40 percent interest in the Wenchang project offshore China, located near the mouth of the Pearl River. The remaining 60 percent of the project is owned by the Chinese National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC). Husky is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.
In terms of refined products facilities, Husky owns and operates the Lloydminster Heavy Oil Upgrader in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, the Asphalt Refinery in Lloydminster, Alberta, the Prince George Refinery in Prince George, British Columbia, the Lima Refinery in Lima, Ohio and is a 50 percent owner with BP of a refinery in Toledo, Ohio. Husky also operates the Husky Lloydminster Ethanol Plant and the Minnedosa Ethanol Plant.
A substantial portion of Husky's property and operations base has come from its acquisition of Renaissance Energy. In 2003, it also purchased the Canadian unit of the American-based Marathon Oil Corporation.
Corporate history[edit]
Now a publicly traded Canadian company with global interests, Husky Energy was founded in 1938 in Cody, Wyoming, in the United States, as the Husky Refining Company. Its primary founder was Glenn Nielsen. The first refinery was built in Cody, with a second constructed later in Riverton, Wyoming. In 1946, the Company relocated to Canada, with the Riverton refinery moved to Lloydminster, Alberta to take advantage of the expanding asphalt and heavy oil opportunities in the area. A wholly owned subsidiary, Husky Oil and Refining Ltd., was created and headquartered in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The Cody refinery continued operations well into the 1970s, producing primarily asphalt. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there were periodic rumors floating around Cody that the refinery would be reopened by a variety of different companies. One of the more persistent rumors was the impending purchase and reactivation of the refinery by Flying J.[citation needed] This never happened, however, and the entire refinery was finally razed in the late 1990s.
In 1991, Li Ka-shing and Hutchison Whampoa acquired controlling ownership of Husky.[12]
In 1998 Husky purchased Mohawk Oil, the largest independent chain of filling stations in Western Canada.[13] Mohawk continues as a banner of filling stations within the Husky company.
Operations[edit]
Husky Energy's operations are divided into two business segments: Upstream and Downstream.
The Upstream division focuses on oil and gas exploration and extraction. In addition to its existing producing assets and opportunities in Heavy Oil and Western Canada, the company has identified three pillars for growth: the Asia Pacific Region, the Oil Sands and the Atlantic Region.
Its Heavy Oil business include seven thermal developments in Saskatchewan, with three additional projects anticipated to be online by the end of 2016.
The Company's transition of its Western Canada portfolio includes a focus on resource plays.
In the Asia Pacific Region, Husky’s Liwan Gas Project in the South China Sea began production in 2014.[7] Husky is advancing the liquids-rich BD field offshore Indonesia, along with three additional shallow water fields.[14]
Husky has a portfolio of oil sands leases, encompassing some 2,500 square kilometres in the Fort McMurray region of northern Alberta. Its Sunrise Energy Project achieved first production in early 2015 and supports online applicants.[8]
Husky is using Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage technology at Sunrise, where bitumen is heated with steam to reduce its viscosity. When the liquid becomes more fluid, it is pumped to the surface and back to the central facility.
The White Rose field (located offshore Newfoundland in the Jeanne d'Arc Basin) includes two production wells at South White Rose that came online in 2015. Exploration work is underway at the Bay du Nord discovery area in the Flemish Pass, with partner Statoil.
Husky has managed the terminal operations for Western Canada Select (WCS)—one of North America's largest heavy crude oil streams— since it came on stream in 2004.[14]
Downstream[edit]
Husky Lloydminster Upgrader[edit]
The Lloydminster Upgrader, in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, converts heavy oil to a high-quality, low sulphur synthetic oil.
Husky Lloydminster Refinery[edit]
Husky's asphalt refinery, in Lloydminster, Alberta, produces more than 30 different types and grades of road asphalt.
Minnedosa Ethanol Plant[edit]
Husky's Ethanol Plant in Minnedosa, Manitoba has been producing ethanol to be blended into gasoline since 1981. In 2007 it was expanded and produces about 130 million litres of ethanol per year.[15]
Lloydminster Ethanol Plant[edit]
The Husky Lloydminster Ethanol Plant came online in 2006 and produces 130 million litres of ethanol per year. In Canada ethanol is blended into gasoline. Feedstock for the plant is mainly non-food feed-grade wheat purchased locally. The plant can also produce Corn ethanol.
Prince George Refinery[edit]
Husky owns and operates the Prince George Refinery in Prince George, British Columbia. The refinery provides unleaded gasoline, seasonal diesel fuels, mixed propane and butane, and heavy fuel oil. The refinery's capacity is 12,000 bpd.
Lima Refinery[edit]
Like a number of other Midwest refiners, Husky was revamping its Lima, Ohio refinery to process Western Canadian Select, (WCS) a heavier but less expensive crude oil. Since 2012 "Lima has run over 60,000 bpd of Canadian crude, but only about 3,000 bpd of that would be particularly heavy with an API gravity below 30."[16] In early January 2015 an explosion damaged the refinery's 26,000-bpd isocracker unit. Later that year Husky announced that, given the low price of oil, it would postpone its USD$300 million crude oil flexibility project.[16] The project will process up to 40,000 bpd of WCS.[16] Work is expected to begin on the first stage of the crude oil flexibility project during a planned maintenance turnaround in the first quarter of 2016.
BP-Husky Toledo Refinery[edit]
Husky and BP arranged a Joint Venture (JV) in 2008 in order to develop and process Alberta bitumen through which Husky acquired a 50 percent share[17] in the 155,000-bpd BP-Husky Toledo Refinery in Oregon, Ohio and BP acquired a 50 percent share of the Husky-operated Sunrise field in Alberta.[9][18][17] This refinery has been upgraded with a coker and is processing bitumen from Sunrise.
Retail operations[edit]
In December 2009, Husky Energy announced that it has entered into an agreement with Suncor Energy Inc. and Suncor Energy Products Inc. to purchase 98 retail outlets in the Ontario market.[19] Husky acquired 68 stations that were branded Sunoco and 30 stations that were branded Petro-Canada. The Company operates a total of about 490 retail stations in Canada.
Corporate governance[edit]
Current members of the board of directors of Husky Energy are: Victor Li, Canning Fok, Frank Sixt, Asim Ghosh, Rob Peabody, Stephen Bradley, Martin Glynn, Poh Chan Koh, Eva Kwok, Stanley Kwok, Frederick Ma, George Magnus, Neil McGee, Colin Russel, Wayne Shaw and William Shurniak.
Tommy Douglas served as a director of Husky Oil after his retirement from politics in 1979.
The current Chief Executive Officer and President of Husky is Rob Peabody. Peabody assumed the role in December 2016, taking over the position from Asim Ghosh, who had served as the CEO since 2010.[20]
