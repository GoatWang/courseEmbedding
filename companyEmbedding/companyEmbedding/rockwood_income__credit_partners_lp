Announces Fourth Quarter 2013 Financial Results, Charter Renewals for a Number of Its Vessels and the Increase of Its Senior Secured Credit Facility to $225.0 MillionMarketwiredJanuary 31, 2014ReblogShareTweetShareATHENS, GREECE--(Marketwired - Jan 31, 2014) - Capital Product Partners L.P. (the "Partnership" or "CPLP") (  NASDAQ :  CPLP ), an international diversified shipping company today released its financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2013.The Partnership's net income for the quarter ended December 31, 2013, was $2.0 million, including a $7.1 million loss from the sale of the M/T Agamemnon II to unaffiliated third parties and a $0.6 million loss related to the settlement of the Partnership's claims against Overseas Shipholding Group Inc. ("OSG") and certain of OSG's subsidiaries in connection with their voluntary filing for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. After taking into account the preferred interest in net income attributable to the unit holders of the 18,922,221 Class B Convertible Preferred Units outstanding as of December 31, 2013, (the "Class B Units" and the "Class B Unitholders"), the result for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 was $0.02 net loss per limited partnership unit, which is $0.37 lower than the $0.35 income per unit from the previous quarter ended September 30, 2013 and $0.53 higher than the $0.55 net loss per unit in the fourth quarter of 2012.Operating surplus for the quarter ended December 31, 2013 was $29.2 million, which is $3.4 million higher than the $25.8 million from the third quarter of 2013 and $6.7 million higher than the $22.5 million of the fourth quarter of 2012. The operating surplus adjusted for the payment of distributions to the Class B Unitholders was $25.2 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2013. Operating surplus is a non-GAAP financial measure used by certain investors to measure the financial performance of the Partnership and other master limited partnerships. Please refer to the section "Appendix A" at the end of the press release, for a reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to net income.Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2013 were $47.0 million, compared to $38.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012; the increase is mainly a result of the Partnership's increased fleet size and improving employment day rates for certain of the Partnership's vessels.Total expenses for the fourth quarter of 2013 were $32.7 million (excluding a $7.1 million loss from the sale of the M/T Agamemnon II to unaffiliated third parties) compared to $26.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 (excluding a $43.2 million impairment charge), the increase mainly a result of the increased fleet size of the Partnership. The vessel operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2013 amounted to $15.4 million for the commercial and technical management of our fleet under the terms of our management agreements, compared to $11.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. The total expenses for the fourth quarter of 2013 also include $14.3 million in depreciation and amortization, compared to $12.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, as a result of our increased fleet size. General and administrative expenses for the fourth quarter of 2013 amounted to $1.4 million compared to $2.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, the decrease resulting from the Partnership's Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan becoming fully vested in the third quarter of 2013.Total other expense, net for the fourth quarter of 2013 amounted to $4.7 million compared to $3.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2012, the increase resulting from higher interest cost as a result of the increased indebtedness of the Partnership.As of December 31, 2013, the Partners' capital amounted to $781.4 million, which is $207.6 million higher than the Partners' capital as of December 31, 2012, which amounted to $573.8 million. This increase primarily reflects the issuance of 13,685,000 common units in the quarter ended September 30, 2013, which raised gross proceeds of approximately $126.6 million, the issuance of the 9.1 million Class B Units, which raised gross proceeds of approximately $75.1 million, combined with the payment of $88.2 million in distributions since December 31, 2012 and the net income for the twelve months period ended December 31, 2013.As of December 31, 2013, the Partnership's total debt has increased by $124.9 million to $583.3 million, compared to total debt of $458.4 million as of December 31, 2012, as a result of the loan advances under the Partnership's credit facilities during the twelve months period ended December 31, 2013 in connection with the acquisition of five 5,023 TEU Container Vessels acquired in 2013.Read MoreFleet DevelopmentsThe M/T Aias (150,393 dwt, Crude Oil Tanker built 2008 Universal Shipbuilding Corp., Japan) and the M/T Amoureux (149,993 dwt, Crude Oil Tanker built 2008 Universal Shipbuilding Corp., Japan) were chartered to Capital Maritime & Trading Corp. ("Capital Maritime") for a minimum charter term of one year (+/- 30 days) for $24,000 gross per day plus 50/50 profit share on actual earnings settled every 6 months. The earliest redelivery under the new charters is in November and December 2014, respectively. Both vessels were previously under charter with Capital Maritime at the same rate.The M/T Amore Mio II (159,982 dwt, Crude Oil Tanker built 2001, Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co., Ltd., South Korea) entered into a new charter with Capital Maritime for a minimum charter term of one year (+/- 30 days) for $17,000 gross per day after its charter expiration to BP Shipping Ltd., which was for a gross rate of $17,500 per day. The earliest redelivery under the new charter is in November 2014.The M/T Arionas (36,725 dwt, IMO II/III Chemical Product Tanker built 2006, Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Company, Ltd., South Korea) extended its employment with Capital Maritime for an additional charter term of a minimum of 12 months for $14,250 gross per day plus 50/50 profit share for breaching Institute Warranty Limits, which is $450 per day higher than its previous employment day rate. The earliest redelivery under the new charter is in October 2014.All charters were unanimously approved by the Conflicts Committee of the Partnership.In October 2013, the Partnership entered into two separate agreements with non-affiliated third parties to acquire an eco-Type MR product tanker, the M/T Aristotelis (51,604 dwt IMO II/III Chemical Product Tanker built 2013, Hyundai Mipo Dockyard Ltd., South Korea), and to sell the M/T Agamemnon II (51,238 dwt IMO II/III Chemical Product Tanker built 2008, STX Shipbuilding Co. Ltd., South Korea). The M/T Agamemnon II was delivered to its new owners on November 5, 2013. The Partnership took delivery of the M/T Aristotelis on November 28, 2013, which shortly thereafter commenced its period time charter for $17,000 gross per day for 18-24 months with Capital Maritime. The acquisition of the M/T Aristotelis was funded with proceeds from the sale of M/T Agamemnon II and approximately $6.3 million from the Partnership's cash balances. As a result of the above acquisitions and charter extensions, the weighted average remaining charter duration of our fleet is 8.8 years as of December 31, 2013 compared to 4.0 years at the end of 2012.Increase of Partnership's Credit Facility to $225.0 millionIn September 2013, the Partnership entered into a new senior secured credit facility of up to $200.0 million led by ING Bank N.V., which was increased to $225.0 million pursuant to an amendment and restatement thereof entered into in December 2013. None of the other material terms of the credit facility were amended. The facility is non-amortizing until March 2016, with a final maturity date in December 2020. The interest margin of this facility is 3.50%, with a commitment fee of 1.00%. The facility will be available for the funding of up to 50% of the charter free value of modern product tankers and post panamax container vessels. In September 2013, the Partnership drew $75.0 million from this senior secured credit facility in connection with the partial financing of the acquisition of three post panamax container vessels. As of January 31, 2014, $150.0 million remain available under this facility.Market CommentaryProduct tanker spot earnings modestly weakened in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter of 2013, but remained at overall robust levels. The decline was mainly driven by lower rates on the transatlantic trade as the lack of arbitrage opportunities and decreased European refinery throughputs limited product shipments from Europe to the East Coast of the United States. The market improved considerably in the second part of the quarter on the back of surging exports from the Gulf of Mexico and a rise in activity on the transatlantic route. Overall, average sport earnings for MR product tankers in 2013 reached their highest level since 2008, as the continuous strong exports from the US Gulf to Latin America, Europe and West Africa, along with stronger rates in the Eastern hemisphere and a firm rate environment on the transatlantic trade observed during the first half of the year, combined to push rates higher.The product tanker period market experienced increased activity in the fourth quarter and throughout 2013, in response to the strengthening spot rate environment and the positive outlook for the sector, while period rates rose to the highest levels since July 2009. The number of period fixtures for product tankers in 2013 is estimated to have reached their highest level on record. We expect the positive development in the product tanker market to continue in 2014 on the back of stronger oil demand growth, rising exports from the US Gulf and favorable changes in the refinery landscape.On the supply side, the product tanker order book continued to experience slippage during 2013, as approximately 33% of the expected MR and handy size tanker newbuildings were not delivered on schedule. Analysts expect that net fleet growth for product tankers for 2014 will be in the region of 3.4%, while overall demand for product tankers for the year is estimated to grow at 4.2%.The Suezmax spot market improved significantly in the fourth quarter, supported by seasonally stronger demand, along with increased long-haul crude movements from West Africa and the Atlantic basin to the Far East and delays in the Turkish Straits. For the year, average Suezmax spot earnings remained at historically low levels as excess tonnage availability counterbalanced the increased demand observed in 2013. The period charter rates as well as the number of period fixtures in the Suezmax sector remained at historically depressed levels in 2013.Slippage for the Suezmax tanker order book continues to affect tonnage supply as approximately 54% of the expected crude newbuildings were not delivered on schedule. Suezmax tanker demand is expected to grow by 4.8% in the full year 2014 with net fleet growth projected at 2.4%.Quarterly Common and Class B Unit Cash DistributionOn January 22, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Partnership declared a cash distribution of $0.2325 per common unit for the fourth quarter of 2013, in line with management's annual distribution guidance. The fourth quarter common unit cash distribution will be paid on February 14, 2014, to unit holders of record on February 7, 2014. In addition, on January 22, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Partnership declared a cash distribution of $0.21375 per Class B Unit for the fourth quarter of 2013, in line with the Partnership's Second Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, as amended. The fourth quarter Class B Unit cash distribution will be paid on February 10, 2014, to Class B Unitholders of record on February 3, 2014.Management CommentaryMr. Ioannis Lazaridis, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer of the Partnership's General Partner, commented:"We are very pleased to see the improved operating surplus of the Partnership for the fourth quarter 2013, which reflects the full quarterly contribution of the three additional 5,023 TEU container vessels with 12 year period charters that we acquired in September 2013. Overall, we are very pleased with the steps we have taken during 2013 to grow the Partnership by increasing our fleet by a total of five container vessels, each with long term period coverage, as well as replacing one 2008 built product tanker with a 2013 built, 'eco' type MR product tanker with increased earnings capacity. Moreover, we have secured a loan facility, which we recently upsized to $225.0 million, which will further allow us to continue to pursue growth for the Partnership."Importantly, the product tanker market continued to improve throughout 2013 with solid period fixture activity on the back of an improving spot market following continuous growth of U.S. exports of refined products and refinery capacity dislocation, thus allowing the Partnership to employ its product tankers at increased period rates."Mr Lazaridis concluded: "I would like to reiterate our commitment to the $0.93 per unit annual distribution guidance going forward and to the continued enhancement of our financial flexibility and distribution coverage. We believe that the improved distribution coverage, the better tanker market fundamentals and potential growth opportunities provide a solid base for the upward revision of our annual distribution guidance in the future."Conference Call and Webcast Today, Friday January 31, 2014 at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time (U.S.), the Partnership will host an interactive conference call.Conference Call DetailsParticipants should dial into the call 10 minutes before the scheduled time using the following numbers: 1 866 819 7111 (U.S. Toll Free Dial In), 0800 953 0329 (UK Toll Free Dial In) or +44 (0)1452 542 301 (Standard International Dial In).

Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Operating SurplusOperating Surplus represents net income adjusted for non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization expense, loss on vessel sale and deferred revenue. Operating Surplus is a quantitative standard used in the publicly-traded partnership investment community to assist in evaluating a partnership's ability to make quarterly cash distributions. Operating Surplus is a non-GAAP financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other indicator of the Partnership's performance required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The table below reconciles Operating Surplus to net income for the three-month period ended December 31, 2013.                      Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure -  Operating Surplus   For the three-month period ended  December 31, 2013     Net income   $ 1,957     Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities           Depreciation and amortization     14,500     Deferred revenue     5,714     Loss on sale of a vessel     7,073     OPERATING SURPLUS PRIOR TO CLASS B PREFERRED UNITS DISTRIBUTION     29,244     Class B preferred units distribution     (4,045 )   ADJUSTED OPERATING SURPLUS     25,199     Increase in recommended reserves     (4,226 )   AVAILABLE CASH   $ 20,973                            ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTrump’s unwitting legacy could be universal health coverageYahoo FinanceEngineer Finds Pattern; Makes Millions in StocksMoney MorningSponsoredSean Hannity responds to claim he ran up a $42,000 tab at Trump's hotel after flying in a 70-year-old lobster from MaineBusiness InsiderU.S. economic growth picks up in second quarter, wages continue to lagReutersVietnam says others should respect its right to drill for South China Sea oilReutersZuckerberg Wife's Ambitious Secret Finally ExposedUNewz.MeSponsoredTwitter is only famous now because of President Trump: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoInvestors yawn as US economic growth rebounds in the second quarter; Amazon fallsYahoo FinanceWall Street opens lower as Amazon weighs on tech stocksReutersDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredChuck Schumer was on the verge of tears speaking about John McCain after Republicans' 'skinny repeal' bill failedBusiness InsiderStarbucks CEO: The Amazon-Whole Foods deal shows where retail is goingYahoo FinanceXbox Live Games With Gold for August 2017InvestorPlace"Women Need To Carry This Device With Them"Siren SongSponsoredAmazon could be the first trillion dollar company: NYSE traderYahoo Finance VideoGDP — What you need to know in markets on FridayYahoo FinanceRussia orders cut in US diplomats in reaction to sanctionsDirk: Gosh, I hope this doesn't lead Russia to deny America of all the Russian cars, Russian electronics, Russian textiles and all other Russian products that we consume.
