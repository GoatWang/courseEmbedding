NASHVILLE, Tenn., Nov. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (NYSE:   BKD) announced today that Labeed Diab will join the Company as its Chief Operating Officer, and Lucinda (Cindy) Baier will join the Company as its Chief Financial Officer, concluding the executive search process previously announced by the Company.  Both Mr. Diab and Ms. Baier will report to Andy Smith, the Company's Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Diab will have responsibility for all aspects of operations, including community and field operations, marketing and sales.  Ms. Baier will have responsibility for the Company's accounting, finance, tax, financial reporting and treasury functions.  Mr. Diab is expected to start on November 16, 2015, and Ms. Baier is expected to start on December 1, 2015.
In addition, the Company announced that Mary Sue Patchett has been promoted to Executive Vice President – Community and Field Operations, reporting to Mr. Diab.  Ms. Patchett has served as President of the Company's Southeast Division since 2013.  The Company's other senior housing division presidents will report to Ms. Patchett and she will join Mr. Diab and Ms. Baier as new members of the Company's senior management executive committee.
As previously announced, Mark Ohlendorf, the Company's President and Chief Financial Officer, will step down as Chief Financial Officer upon Ms. Baier's joining the Company and will continue to serve in his role as President.  In the near term, Mr. Ohlendorf will assist in the transition of his operating duties to Mr. Diab and his CFO duties to Ms. Baier.  In his role as President, Mr. Ohlendorf will be responsible for revenue cycle management, strategy and innovation, owner relations, corporate development and acquisitions, and public policy and government affairs.
Mr. Diab brings significant retail and health & wellness operational leadership experience to the Company.  Most recently, he served as President of Health and Wellness of Walmart's US division.  He was responsible for the organization's full-service health and wellness offerings, including vision centers and primary care clinics, comprising approximately 5,000 nationwide locations with more than 85,000 associates.  Mr. Diab was previously President of the Midwest division for Walmart US, managing retail stores and overseeing approximately 100,000 associates.
Ms. Baier has more than fifteen years of executive leadership experience in accounting, taxation, finance and treasury functions, having most recently served as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Navigant Consulting, Inc.  In addition, she previously served as Chief Financial Officer of Central Parking System, Inc., Movie Gallery, Inc., and World Kitchen, LLC.
Ms. Patchett has over 30 years of senior care and housing experience serving in leadership roles, most recently as a Division President since February 2013.  Prior to that, she was a Divisional Vice President since joining Brookdale in September 2011 with the Company's acquisition of Horizon Bay.  At Horizon Bay, Ms. Patchett had served as Chief Operating Officer and as Senior Vice President of Operations.
"I am excited to welcome Labeed and Cindy, who bring decades of executive experience in large organizations with complex multi-site businesses, to help lead our organization," said Mr. Smith.  "Labeed's mix of retail and health and wellness operational leadership experience is uniquely suited for Brookdale, and we will rely on his expertise to create stockholder value through improvements to our operational effectiveness," continued Mr. Smith.  "Cindy brings to Brookdale extensive financial and strategic experience in a diverse set of industries.  We will count on her leadership as we work to leverage our opportunities to create value and achieve long-term growth.  Cindy's arrival in the Chief Financial Officer role will also allow Mark to focus on his role as President in areas critical to our business, including the Company's innovation initiatives.  Finally, Mary Sue has accumulated tremendous operations experience in her more than three decades of leadership in our industry, and she will be key to blending Labeed's outside perspective with our business and culture," continued Mr. Smith.

Bringing transparency to health insurance



Why would Walmart launch an insurance education service for the 140 million Americans who shop its stores each week? For one thing, because more than 60% of Americans have a tough time understanding their health insurance plan options, according to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, and nearly 40% feel that they picked the wrong plan after enrolling.

Serving the medically underserved: Walmart gears up for Care Clinic rollout



A new and radically different concept for frontline health care emerged last year when Walmart unveiled its first Walmart Care Clinics in Texas, Georgia and South Carolina. If things go according to plan, patients and health plan payers across the United States can look forward to a cheaper and more affordable alternative to the family doctor for nearly all their primary care needs.

Through innovation and realignment, Walmart targets frayed health system



The retail behemoth that is Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is fixing its sights on a new target: the nation’s overstretched and overly costly primary healthcare system. The result could be a major disruption of that system and the acceleration of health reform in America.

Walmart eyes bigger role in specialty Rx



While building a 4,500-store retail pharmacy powerhouse in the United States, Walmart also has kept pace with the specialty pharmacy revolution and is positioning itself to play a stronger role in this most innovative, dynamic and complex area of pharmaceutical R&D and bioengineering.






 


	  April 22, 2015



Aligning health services, nutrition



“Our health-and-wellness experts are leading the way for the future of health care in our stores and beyond.”
	For any retail pharmacy provider, that would be a bold, perhaps even overly confident, assertion. But coming as it does from Walmart, it’s something that both the U.S. healthcare system and Walmart’s competitors are taking seriously.

Walmart taps proven operators to boost its health-and-wellness presence



Just two months after Labeed Diab was named head of health and wellness at Walmart, Mark Phillips was elevated to the role of VP pharmaceutical merchandising. Phillips assumes command of more than 4,175 retail pharmacy operations that generates $16.8 billion in pharmacy revenue, according to DSN's PoweRx 50. In his new role, Phillips will lead the pharmaceutical merchandising team and report to Diab. Phillips, who most recently served as the senior director of merchandising in small formats, is a long-time buyer for Walmart and may be an indication of Walmart's steadfast commitment to growing pharmacy, health and wellness, especially across Walmart's smaller formats.

	Before joining Walmart, Diab served as regional VP of Aramark's Health Care Division and as regional VP for Rite Aid.
