Operations[edit]
TAT Technologies is a manufacturer of environmental control systems for the commercial and military aviation industries. The systems it provides include heat exchangers and cooling systems, essential for the operation of aircraft machinery and electronics, as well as air conditioners for use in military installations and in armored vehicles.[2][3][4] TAT's clients have included the United States Army, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Cirrus Aircraft, and Embraer.[5][6][7][8] The company's competitors include AMETEK, Honeywell International and Hamilton Sundstrand.[9]
Subsidiaries[edit]

Limco Airepair Inc. – manufacturer of heat transfer equipment.[10]
Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC – provider of component maintenance and aircraft overhaul. Headquartered in Kernersville, North Carolina, the company's roots date back to the 1940s.[10][11]
Turbochrome LTD – provider of jet engine component maintenance. Headquartered in Kiryat Gat, the company's was founded in 1969 as a joint venture between Chromalloy and Israel Aerospace Industries.

History[edit]
TAT Technologies was founded in 1969 by Shlomo Ostersetzer in response to a French arms embargo on combatants in the Six-Day War – an embargo that primarily affected Israel. The company was established with the goal of replacing the French aviation industry, upon which Israel had relied extensively until that time.[12][13][14][15][16][17] TAT has been listed on the NASDAQ American stock exchange since 1987 and joined the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2005.[18] In 2007 the ownership of TAT was acquired from Ostersetzer and partner Dov Zeelim by Isal, a subsidiary of KMN Holdings, controlled by Roni Elroy, son-in-law of Yitzhak Tshuva.[19]
Executive management[edit]
Shmuel Fledel, a former colonel in the Israeli Air Force, was appointed CEO of TAT in May 2008. Shmuel resigned in the beginning of 2012 and Mr Itzik Maaravi was appointed instead of him. Prior to Fledel's appointment, founder Shlomo Ostersetzer, ETH Zurich alumnus (Mechanical Engineering), and Dov Zeelim served as CEOs of the company. The CFO of the company has been since 2009 Mr Yaron Shalem[20][21][22][23]

Operations[edit]
TAT Technologies is a manufacturer of environmental control systems for the commercial and military aviation industries. The systems it provides include heat exchangers and cooling systems, essential for the operation of aircraft machinery and electronics, as well as air conditioners for use in military installations and in armored vehicles.[2][3][4] TAT's clients have included the United States Army, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Cirrus Aircraft, and Embraer.[5][6][7][8] The company's competitors include AMETEK, Honeywell International and Hamilton Sundstrand.[9]
Subsidiaries[edit]

Limco Airepair Inc. – manufacturer of heat transfer equipment.[10]
Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC – provider of component maintenance and aircraft overhaul. Headquartered in Kernersville, North Carolina, the company's roots date back to the 1940s.[10][11]
Turbochrome LTD – provider of jet engine component maintenance. Headquartered in Kiryat Gat, the company's was founded in 1969 as a joint venture between Chromalloy and Israel Aerospace Industries.

History[edit]
TAT Technologies was founded in 1969 by Shlomo Ostersetzer in response to a French arms embargo on combatants in the Six-Day War – an embargo that primarily affected Israel. The company was established with the goal of replacing the French aviation industry, upon which Israel had relied extensively until that time.[12][13][14][15][16][17] TAT has been listed on the NASDAQ American stock exchange since 1987 and joined the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2005.[18] In 2007 the ownership of TAT was acquired from Ostersetzer and partner Dov Zeelim by Isal, a subsidiary of KMN Holdings, controlled by Roni Elroy, son-in-law of Yitzhak Tshuva.[19]
Executive management[edit]
Shmuel Fledel, a former colonel in the Israeli Air Force, was appointed CEO of TAT in May 2008. Shmuel resigned in the beginning of 2012 and Mr Itzik Maaravi was appointed instead of him. Prior to Fledel's appointment, founder Shlomo Ostersetzer, ETH Zurich alumnus (Mechanical Engineering), and Dov Zeelim served as CEOs of the company. The CFO of the company has been since 2009 Mr Yaron Shalem[20][21][22][23]

History[edit]
TAT Technologies was founded in 1969 by Shlomo Ostersetzer in response to a French arms embargo on combatants in the Six-Day War – an embargo that primarily affected Israel. The company was established with the goal of replacing the French aviation industry, upon which Israel had relied extensively until that time.[12][13][14][15][16][17] TAT has been listed on the NASDAQ American stock exchange since 1987 and joined the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2005.[18] In 2007 the ownership of TAT was acquired from Ostersetzer and partner Dov Zeelim by Isal, a subsidiary of KMN Holdings, controlled by Roni Elroy, son-in-law of Yitzhak Tshuva.[19]
Executive management[edit]
Shmuel Fledel, a former colonel in the Israeli Air Force, was appointed CEO of TAT in May 2008. Shmuel resigned in the beginning of 2012 and Mr Itzik Maaravi was appointed instead of him. Prior to Fledel's appointment, founder Shlomo Ostersetzer, ETH Zurich alumnus (Mechanical Engineering), and Dov Zeelim served as CEOs of the company. The CFO of the company has been since 2009 Mr Yaron Shalem[20][21][22][23]

Operations[edit]
TAT Technologies is a manufacturer of environmental control systems for the commercial and military aviation industries. The systems it provides include heat exchangers and cooling systems, essential for the operation of aircraft machinery and electronics, as well as air conditioners for use in military installations and in armored vehicles.[2][3][4] TAT's clients have included the United States Army, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Cirrus Aircraft, and Embraer.[5][6][7][8] The company's competitors include AMETEK, Honeywell International and Hamilton Sundstrand.[9]
Subsidiaries[edit]

Limco Airepair Inc. – manufacturer of heat transfer equipment.[10]
Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC – provider of component maintenance and aircraft overhaul. Headquartered in Kernersville, North Carolina, the company's roots date back to the 1940s.[10][11]
Turbochrome LTD – provider of jet engine component maintenance. Headquartered in Kiryat Gat, the company's was founded in 1969 as a joint venture between Chromalloy and Israel Aerospace Industries.

History[edit]
TAT Technologies was founded in 1969 by Shlomo Ostersetzer in response to a French arms embargo on combatants in the Six-Day War – an embargo that primarily affected Israel. The company was established with the goal of replacing the French aviation industry, upon which Israel had relied extensively until that time.[12][13][14][15][16][17] TAT has been listed on the NASDAQ American stock exchange since 1987 and joined the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2005.[18] In 2007 the ownership of TAT was acquired from Ostersetzer and partner Dov Zeelim by Isal, a subsidiary of KMN Holdings, controlled by Roni Elroy, son-in-law of Yitzhak Tshuva.[19]
Executive management[edit]
Shmuel Fledel, a former colonel in the Israeli Air Force, was appointed CEO of TAT in May 2008. Shmuel resigned in the beginning of 2012 and Mr Itzik Maaravi was appointed instead of him. Prior to Fledel's appointment, founder Shlomo Ostersetzer, ETH Zurich alumnus (Mechanical Engineering), and Dov Zeelim served as CEOs of the company. The CFO of the company has been since 2009 Mr Yaron Shalem[20][21][22][23]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Operations[edit]
TAT Technologies is a manufacturer of environmental control systems for the commercial and military aviation industries. The systems it provides include heat exchangers and cooling systems, essential for the operation of aircraft machinery and electronics, as well as air conditioners for use in military installations and in armored vehicles.[2][3][4] TAT's clients have included the United States Army, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Cirrus Aircraft, and Embraer.[5][6][7][8] The company's competitors include AMETEK, Honeywell International and Hamilton Sundstrand.[9]
Subsidiaries[edit]

Limco Airepair Inc. – manufacturer of heat transfer equipment.[10]
Piedmont Aviation Component Services LLC – provider of component maintenance and aircraft overhaul. Headquartered in Kernersville, North Carolina, the company's roots date back to the 1940s.[10][11]
Turbochrome LTD – provider of jet engine component maintenance. Headquartered in Kiryat Gat, the company's was founded in 1969 as a joint venture between Chromalloy and Israel Aerospace Industries.

History[edit]
TAT Technologies was founded in 1969 by Shlomo Ostersetzer in response to a French arms embargo on combatants in the Six-Day War – an embargo that primarily affected Israel. The company was established with the goal of replacing the French aviation industry, upon which Israel had relied extensively until that time.[12][13][14][15][16][17] TAT has been listed on the NASDAQ American stock exchange since 1987 and joined the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange in 2005.[18] In 2007 the ownership of TAT was acquired from Ostersetzer and partner Dov Zeelim by Isal, a subsidiary of KMN Holdings, controlled by Roni Elroy, son-in-law of Yitzhak Tshuva.[19]
Executive management[edit]
Shmuel Fledel, a former colonel in the Israeli Air Force, was appointed CEO of TAT in May 2008. Shmuel resigned in the beginning of 2012 and Mr Itzik Maaravi was appointed instead of him. Prior to Fledel's appointment, founder Shlomo Ostersetzer, ETH Zurich alumnus (Mechanical Engineering), and Dov Zeelim served as CEOs of the company. The CFO of the company has been since 2009 Mr Yaron Shalem[20][21][22][23]
