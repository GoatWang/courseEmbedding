How to Use ND Filters: Tips, Tricks, and Special Effects
Read More 







This Cokin P Series Hard-Edge Graduated Neutral Density 0.3 Filter is designed for use with a Cokin P Series Filter Holder. It helps to darken specific areas of an image, such as bright skies, while allowing for a normal, unaffected exposure in the other regions of the image. The filter is densest at the edge and tapers to clear by the middle, with a hard-edged line of transition between the dense and clear areas. A neutral density filter with a hard-edged line of transition is useful for images which include defined horizon lines. Neutral density filters do not affect the coloration of the image and this filter provides up to a 1-stop reduction in light from entering a lens. This filter is made of durable, optical resin (CR39) and measures 1.6mm thick.

Am nearly out of ink so I am reordering and really like the fact that this order is costing less than my first order due to a % off and free shipping. Your prices are much lower than the big box stores. I am on Social Security and this discount  really helps.Thank You!
