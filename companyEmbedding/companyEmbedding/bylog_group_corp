Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of %25, 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the
securities offered for sale by the Company. There is no assurance that we will
raise the full $90,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will
receive any proceeds from the offering.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,500 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Dmitrii Iaroshenko, our
president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Mr. Iaroshenko’s verbal agreement to provide
us loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these
loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks
become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Mr.
Iaroshenko will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of
this offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by
Mr. Iaroshenko. Mr. Iaroshenko will be repaid from revenues of operations if and
when we generate sufficient revenues to pay the obligation. We have no
agreements with Mr. Iaroshenko prohibiting us from making any payments from
offering proceeds, or prior to generating revenues.


As to the present date, there are many companies with similar services. There
are few barriers of entry in the business and level of competition is extremely
high. We intend to focus our forces on the specific needs related to our
potential clients. We consider high usability of service as an advantage over
our competitors on the market. The features are planned to be the following:

- Visual representation of the information.

- Guided assistance in a form of pop-up hints throughout every step of
  advertising on our website.

- Showing examples of what type of information has to be typed in every field
  (such as figures, description and any other sort of data).

- “Step-by-step” video tutorials.

We see our main competitive advantage in narrowing down to a particular business
sphere. So we can work out the most detailed project answering the needs of only
one business field - digital design, illustration and photo manipulation in
advertising. We expect narrowing down to result in more professional services
with higher competitive potential to be delivered.

We hope attracting customers with the participation of their sold-to parties to
be mutual. We expect customers to be attracted by the self-marketing and
profit-making potential of our web platform, meanwhile we expect sold-to parties
to get attracted by the number of skillful work performers to reside within one
web site.


Company Description
Bylog Group Corp. was incorporated in Nevada on August 21, 2015. We are
development stage company and commence operations in the business web
development and online advertising. We plan to set up a web-platform for people
willing to deliver services in design. Our Internet platform allows


 web
designers to place and promote their portfolio and a description of their
professional competences and services. These portfolios can be presented on our
web platform in the form of landing pages with any interface and programming
code. If our clients require a landing page programming or coding, we intend to
offer such service to them. The web-platform is planned to be a micro-job
service for any professional or an amateur interested in delivering services
regarding advertisement: from poster design to video production.

A development agreement is a document used when an individual or company (''Developer'') is entering into a development project with an individual or company (''Company''), to create a new product. For example, this type of agreement might be used if one technology company agreed to provide development services for another technnology company. Alternatively, a restaurant chain can also use this type of agreement when entering into a business relationship with a franchisee.
The agreement is meant to protect the intellectual property of the parties, and designates certain rights and responsibilities between the parties. A development agreement usually includes information regarding obligations, compensation, and how costs shall be distributed. Stipulations regarding which party will provide materials and said materials will be handled, may also be included.  Stipulations regarding which party will provide materials and said materials will be handled, may also be included. 
The agreement may include language for ownership of all prototypes, notebooks, reports, and other related items for the development project. Insurance, indemnification clauses, and rights to termination of the agreement are also typically included in a development agreement.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
