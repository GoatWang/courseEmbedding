Good Guys: Scopia’s Matthew Sirovich on Helping NYC’s Homeless

					Sirovich, a managing director at Scopia Capital, serves on the board of the Bowery Residents’ Committee, which is working to tackle homelessness in New York City.
				






 
 



 
 Matthew Sirovich and wife Meredith Elson



    The streets of New York City have never been an easy place.
    Right now approximately 3,350 men and women call them home, and
    more than 50,000 spend the night in a shelter, according to
    recent statistics released by the city’s
    Department of Homeless Services. 

Matthew Sirovich grew up in New York in the 1970s, a
    difficult era when the city was on the verge of bankruptcy. He
    remembers seeing homeless people on the street, and he
    developed a sympathy for them. "That only exhibited itself for
    the most part for 40 years of my life when I would give money
    to homeless on the street from time to time," he says.
That changed when Sirovich, 48, managing partner at
    $4.5 billion hedge fund firm Scopia Capital Management,
    reconnected with a high school classmate at a reunion. That
    classmate, Muzzy Rosenblatt, is the executive director of the
    Bowery
    Residents’ Committee, a nonprofit that
    provides services to the homeless.
Their conversation led to a tour of BRC’s
    facilities. Sirovich was impressed by the caliber of people
    working for BRC and the outcomes they attain for their clients.
    It was a very educational visit, he says.
"I learned a lot more about homeless people than I ever
    knew," says Sirovich. "I got a much better sense of why people
    become homeless."
He joined the board six years ago, then joined the finance
    committee. He was elected treasurer last year.
BRC helps those struggling with substance abuse, provides
    transitional housing and permanent housing, and helps its
    clients find jobs. Many New Yorkers have probably seen BRC
    staff in action on the streets or in the subway — BRC
    has a contract with the Metropolitan Transit Authority to help
    men and women who are sleeping on subways and in stations.
But New York’s housing crisis means that there
    are few options for the homeless or for providing housing, and
    there are also fewer subsidies for permanent housing in the
    city. "There are not a lot of options right now in terms of
    where current clients can go when they are ready to take on the
    responsibility of permanent housing," says Sirovich.
To attempt to answer that need, BRC has created a new model
    for financing low-income housing. The result will be a
    combination shelter and apartment building in the Bronx, to be
    named Landing Road.
By law, New York City must provide shelter for the homeless,
    which is usually done through the shelter system, paid for by
    the city. What the financing model for Landing Road does, says
    Sirovich, is use the shelter part of the development to fund
    the apartments. "The rates the city pays for shelters have
    become attractive enough for commercial for-profit landlords,"
    explains Sirovich. "This model would take some of those profits
    out of private investors’ hands and put them into
    a nonprofit that can then use those economics to subsidize
    affordable housing."
Sirovich points to a lack of innovation when it comes to
    housing solutions for the homeless, which he ascribes to the
    lack of funding from public sources to develop new ideas. BRC
    has been a leader in finding new ways to fund housing, he says,
    often turning to private donations. "Once the concept is
    proven, it’s more feasible to get funding from
    public sources," Sirovich says.
As treasurer, he works with BRC’s staff and
    oversees the organization’s finances.
    BRC’s revenues come primarily from New York City
    and New York State contracts, although the organization is
    concentrating on increasing contributions from private sources.
    "That’s more of a priority because it allows us
    the flexibility to be creative with solutions," says
    Sirovich.
Rosenblatt says that Sirovich’s knowledge of
    finance has been invaluable to BRC and its board, but equally
    important are his compassion and readiness to educate
    others.
"Matt has become such a willing and skilled communicator of
    what this organization is trying to do and what our people are
    trying to achieve," says Rosenblatt. "He connects us to other
    people, and that is how minds get changed."
Changing minds is something Sirovich is keen to do, and he
    thinks there’s a growing interest in helping the
    homeless get their lives on track. "I think everyone wants to
    make New York a better place for everyone to live," he says.
    "Helping BRC is a great way to help New York City."
