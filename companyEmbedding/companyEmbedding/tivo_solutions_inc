Therefore, depending on the number of DVRs and tuners you have available, you may not be able to have all ten operating simultaneously.
	TiVo BOLT and  Roamio devices allow for dynamic tuner allocation, so the tuner is only used when the Mini needs it and is released back to the DVR for use when the TiVo Mini isn’t in use. TiVo Premiere DVRs do NOT support dynamic tuner allocation, so any Mini connected to a Premiere is allocated a constantly dedicated tuner and therefore reduces the tuners available for the Premiere DVR.
	 TiVo Mini does not have a tuner or hard drive, and does not need a CableCARD. Additionally, the remote in the TiVo App cannot control TiVo Mini.  Can DVR be wireless and still connect to Mini?No, you must use a wired connection (Ethernet or MoCA) to connect your DVR to a TiVo Mini. Wireless  networking is not supported.

TiVo Roamio® OTA 1 TB DVR
Freedom has more space than ever.

















A premium unified experience. Without the premium price.
The TiVo Roamio OTA DVR was built for those looking for a cable experience on antenna TV. It works with any HD antenna, delivers one terabyte of recording capacity (150 HD hours), has SkipMode™ and QuickMode™ and also integrates all your streaming content from Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, YouTube, Pandora and more. Best of all, it’s now available without a monthly TiVo service fee. Pay once and the rest is all free-TV gravy.



Content Sources
Output





Find movies and shows with unified search.
OneSearch™ scours multiple platforms like TV and Netflix simultaneously, so your search experience is always fast, simple and seamless. No more drilling down into each app and doing multiple hunt-and-seek searches. Find shows and movies by title, actor, director or keyword—and start watching in seconds.








Organize every season and  episode into a unified watchlist.
OnePass™ tracks down every available season and episode of a show—whether it’s on television or a streaming app—and creates a customizable watchlist for you. Start with the pilot episode or jump in anywhere mid-season. OnePass even automatically records upcoming episodes and adds them to your list.
















Advanced control features you can’t get with cable or satellite.
Using an HD antenna shouldn’t require you to sacrifice features or variety. That’s why Roamio OTA is packed with the most advanced control features TiVo has to offer—like SkipMode, QuickMode and OneSearch—but it also delivers must-have conveniences like a two-week program guide, the ability to record four shows at once, and watch-and-control mobile capabilities. Get a premium experience at a cost you can afford.








Skip commercial breaks with the new SkipMode.
No more waiting for commercial breaks to be over. With a single press of a button, you can continue watching your recorded show. SkipMode works with the main channels, including ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, The CW and more.
WATCH VIDEO 



QuickMode speeds up your shows by 30%.
QuickMode lets you zip through your recorded shows—and shows with a buffer—30% faster than normal speed with pitch-corrected audio. You zoom along and nobody sounds like a caffeinated chipmunk. It’s the ideal way to power through slow-moving news shows, sports and long-winded political debates.
WATCH VIDEO 








Record up to four shows at one time.
TiVo Roamio OTA DVR can handle the biggest entertainment appetite. It records up to four shows at once and provides up to 1 TB of recording capacity—enough for roughly 150 hours of HD programming. 

Radio Frequency Remote
The powerful RF signal from your remote lets you control your TiVo Roamio OTA DVR, even if it’s tucked away behind a cabinet door.

Add a TiVo Mini® or 10, and watch on all your TVs.
TiVo Mini connects to the TiVo Roamio OTA DVR through a home network via Ethernet or coaxial cable. Stream recorded shows or live TV from a TiVo Roamio OTA DVR. Get access to features like SkipMode, unified search, and unified watchlists. Up to 10 Minis can be added to a single network.

TiVo and Netflix Enter Into Product and Intellectual Property Agreements 

SAN CARLOS, Calif. and LOS GATOS, Calif. — November 28, 2016 —TiVo Corporation (NASDAQ: TIVO), the global leader in entertainment technology and audience insights, and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), the world’s leading Internet TV network, today announced they signed licensing agreements that allow both companies to deliver a better entertainment experience to consumers.
Unprecedented Product Partnership
A product agreement calls for TiVo to continue integrating Netflix into TiVo set-top boxes available to consumers through a select, but growing number of pay-TV providers and retail stores. Customers will benefit from the integrated offering, which includes unified search across the content catalog and a Netflix button on remote controls.
“The partnership between Netflix and TiVo dates back to our early days of streaming video,” said Bill Holmes, Netflix global head of business development. “Building on this history, the agreements provide consumers freedom to watch their favorite TV shows and movies whenever and wherever, with an integrated experience across more devices.”
Delivering a Better Entertainment Experience to OTT with Patented Technologies
A separate intellectual property agreement provides Netflix a license to the TiVo patent portfolios and a license to the Intellectual Ventures patent portfolio for over-the-top offerings. This agreement represents one of the first licenses granted under the exclusive partnership with Intellectual Ventures announced earlier this year.
“Our agreements with Netflix represent a major milestone for TiVo as we expand our offerings for the fast-growing OTT space, and further demonstrates our commitment to delivering innovative technologies to new and emerging markets,” said Tom Carson, CEO, TiVo. “From products to patented technologies, TiVo is helping companies quickly adapt to a rapidly changing media industry and create beautiful user experiences that keep consumers connected to their favorite entertainment.”
About Netflix
Netflix is the world’s leading Internet television network with over 86 million members in over 190 countries enjoying more than 125 million hours of TV shows and movies per day, including original series, documentaries and feature films. Members can watch as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on nearly any Internet-connected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials or commitments.
About TiVo
TiVo (NASDAQ: TIVO) is the global leader in entertainment technology and audience insights. From the interactive program guide to the DVR, TiVo delivers innovative products and licensable technologies that revolutionize how people find content across a changing media landscape. TiVo enables the world’s leading media and entertainment providers to deliver the ultimate entertainment experience.

Tivo Solutions Inc. Company Profile

   Prime time is anytime with TiVo. That's the idea behind TiVo and its digital video recorder (DVR). The DVR (similar to a VCR, but using a hard drive instead of videocassette) allows more than 7 million subscribers to record standard- and high-definition TV (broadcast, cable, or satellite). The company sells DVRs online and through electronics retailers such as Best Buy. In addition to buying a DVR, customers pay for TiVo's subscription service, which is essentially a high-tech TV listing. TiVo reaches cable and satellite viewers by licensing its technology to DIRECTV, Comcast, Virgin Media, Vodafone, and other service providers worldwide. In 2016 TiVo agreed to be bought by Rovi.
