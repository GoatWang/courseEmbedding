Early life[edit]
In senior high school Liao was originally an outfielder until the team's pitching coach noticed him throw a 93 mph fastball and encouraged him to become a pitcher.
In the 2004 CPBL Draft, La New Bears and Macoto Cobras noticed Liao pitch up to 88 mph with a sidearm delivery and both teams welcomed Liao to enter the Draft. With no other teams attentions, Brother Elephants picked up Liao in the first round of draft.
Professional career[edit]
In his first career season, Liao pitched only one game: three innings earning two runs. The Elephants were ready to release Liao; and the Bears were ready to claim him however the 2005 manager convinced the team to keep Liao; he thought that Liao could be an excellent pitcher and just needed a chance.
In the 2006 season, the pitching coach made Liao a starting pitcher.
On May 10, 2007 Liao got his first career win in CPBL.
In the 2008 CPBL season, he gained the ERA Championship Award and the Most Progressive Award. Liao later participated in the 2009 World Baseball Classic and showed up in the Round 1 Pool A match between Chinese Taipei and South Korea, the eventual runner-up. He was allowed one point in his 3-inning pitching and his performance was praised by South Korean manager Kim In-Sik.[1]
After the 2009 Taiwan Series Liao came under investigation for game fixing allegations. On January 6, 2010, Liao confessed to the Banciao District Prosecutors' Office that in 2007 when he was a minor player with only NT$55,000 (ca. USD$1,700) monthly salary, he accepted NT$600,000 (ca. USD$18,500) from gamblers and pitched one game for them. Liao also insisted that it was his only game-fixing activity throughout his career and because he later felt deeply uneasy for it, he donated NT$300,000 to local charitable organizations. As a result, Liao was expelled by the Brother Elephants, ending his short baseball career.[2][3]
As of September 2010, Liao coaches in a club baseball team in his hometown of Taoyuan County.

Brother Elephants (2005–2009)




This is a Chinese name; the family name is Liao.
Liao Yu-cheng (traditional Chinese: 廖于誠; simplified Chinese: 廖于诚; pinyin: Liào Yúchéng; Wade–Giles: Liao4 Yú2 Cheng2; born September 4, 1980 in Taoyuan County (now Taoyuan City), Taiwan) is a former Taiwanese professional baseball player who belonged to the Brother Elephants of Chinese Professional Baseball League.
Liao was a submarine pitcher and was given the nickname Golden Submarine due to Brother Elephant's yellow uniform.

Early life[edit]
In senior high school Liao was originally an outfielder until the team's pitching coach noticed him throw a 93 mph fastball and encouraged him to become a pitcher.
In the 2004 CPBL Draft, La New Bears and Macoto Cobras noticed Liao pitch up to 88 mph with a sidearm delivery and both teams welcomed Liao to enter the Draft. With no other teams attentions, Brother Elephants picked up Liao in the first round of draft.
Professional career[edit]
In his first career season, Liao pitched only one game: three innings earning two runs. The Elephants were ready to release Liao; and the Bears were ready to claim him however the 2005 manager convinced the team to keep Liao; he thought that Liao could be an excellent pitcher and just needed a chance.
In the 2006 season, the pitching coach made Liao a starting pitcher.
On May 10, 2007 Liao got his first career win in CPBL.
In the 2008 CPBL season, he gained the ERA Championship Award and the Most Progressive Award. Liao later participated in the 2009 World Baseball Classic and showed up in the Round 1 Pool A match between Chinese Taipei and South Korea, the eventual runner-up. He was allowed one point in his 3-inning pitching and his performance was praised by South Korean manager Kim In-Sik.[1]
After the 2009 Taiwan Series Liao came under investigation for game fixing allegations. On January 6, 2010, Liao confessed to the Banciao District Prosecutors' Office that in 2007 when he was a minor player with only NT$55,000 (ca. USD$1,700) monthly salary, he accepted NT$600,000 (ca. USD$18,500) from gamblers and pitched one game for them. Liao also insisted that it was his only game-fixing activity throughout his career and because he later felt deeply uneasy for it, he donated NT$300,000 to local charitable organizations. As a result, Liao was expelled by the Brother Elephants, ending his short baseball career.[2][3]
As of September 2010, Liao coaches in a club baseball team in his hometown of Taoyuan County.

With no other teams attentions, Brother Elephants picked up Liao in the first round of draft.Professional careerIn his first career season, Liao pitched only one game: three innings earning two runs.

Liao also insisted that it was his only game-fixing activity throughout his career and because he later felt deeply uneasy for it, he donated NT$300,000 to local charitable organizations. As a result, Liao was expelled by the Brother Elephants, ending his short baseball career.[2][3]As of September 2010, Liao coaches in a club baseball team in his hometown of Taoyuan County.Career statisticsSeasonTeamGWLHDSVCGSHOBBSOERINNERA2005Brother Elephants10000000023.06.002006Brother Elephants1203000037201837.14.342007Brother Elephants22470000586844119.13.322008Brother Elephants2111300417210234132.22.312009Brother Elephants221160010836448130.23.306Total5 years7223160051222249132384.23.09References^ Chinese Taipei roughed up by Korea^ Baseballs signed by players in game-fixing scandal perplexes CPBL^ Baseball stars indicted in latest game-fixing scandalExternal linksPlayer information from WikiBaseball (Chinese)Baseball-referenceAwardsPreceded byPete MunroCPBL ERA Champion Award2008Succeeded byPan Wei-lun(潘威倫)Preceded byHsu Yu-wei(徐余偉)CPBL Most Progressive Award2008Succeeded byCheng Ta-Hung(鄭達鴻)vteChinese Taipei roster – 2009 World Baseball Classic – 14th place4 Kao Kuo-ching7 Kuo Yen-wen8 Chih-Yao Chan10 Lin Han11 Lin Yueh-ping12 Chen-Chang Lee14 Wang Seng-wei15 Kun-Sheng Lin20 Cheng Kai-wen21 Fu-Te Ni22 Lin Yi-chuan23 Peng Cheng-min24 Kuo Dai-chi25 Chiang Chih-hsien31 Lin Wei-chu34 Kao Chih-kang36 Kuo Yi-feng42 Tseng Sung-wei44 Lin Che-hsuan47 Liao Yu-cheng48 Lo Chia-jen51 Chi-Hung Cheng55 Pan Wu-hsiung62 Chia-Chun Tang81 Po-Yu Lin90 Po-Hsuan Keng98 Ko-Chien Lin99 Chen Hung-wenManager 3 Chih-Hsien YehCoach 88 Kuo Tai-yuanCoach 26 Wang Kuang-huiCoach 70 Lu Wen-shengCoach 6 Wei-Cheng ChenCoach 65 Lin Kun-hanCoach 68 Wang Cheng-hao

Description
The latest volume in the Advanced Biotechnology series provides an overview of the main product classes and platform chemicals produced by biotechnological processes today, with applications in the food, healthcare and fine chemical industries. Alongside the production of drugs and flavors as well as amino acids, bio-based monomers and polymers and biofuels, basic insights are also given as to the biotechnological processes yielding such products and how large-scale production may be enabled and improved.
Of interest to biotechnologists, bio and chemical engineers, as well as those working in the biotechnological, chemical, and food industries.
