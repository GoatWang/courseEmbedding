What is 'Long/Short Equity'
Long/short equity is an investing strategy of taking long positions in stocks that are expected to appreciate and short positions in stocks that are expected to decline. A long/short equity strategy seeks to minimize market exposure, while profiting from stock gains in the long positions and price declines in the short positions. Although this may not always be the case, the strategy would be profitable on a net basis as long as the long positions generate more profit than the short positions, or the other way around. The long/short equity strategy is popular with hedge funds, many of which employ a market-neutral strategy where the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal.

BREAKING DOWN 'Long/Short Equity'
While many hedge funds also employ a long/short equity strategy with a long bias (such as 130/30, where long exposure is 130% and short exposure is 30%), comparatively fewer hedge funds employ a short bias to their long/short strategy.
Long/short equity strategies can be differentiated in a number of ways – by market geography (advanced economies, emerging markets, Europe, etc.), sector (energy, technology, etc.), investment philosophy (value or growth) and so on. An example of a long/short equity strategy with a broad mandate would be a global equity growth fund; an example of a relatively narrow mandate would be an emerging markets healthcare fund.
A popular variation of the long/short model is that of the “pair trade," which involves offsetting a long position on a stock with a short position on another stock in the same sector. For example, an investor in the technology space may take a long position in Microsoft and offset that with a short position in Intel. If the investor buys 1,000 shares of Microsoft at $33 each, and Intel is trading at $22, the short leg of this paired trade would involve purchasing 1,500 Intel shares so that the dollar amounts of the long and short positions are equal.
The ideal situation for this long/short strategy would be for Microsoft to appreciate and for Intel to decline. If Microsoft rises to $35 and Intel falls to $21, the overall profit on this strategy would be $3,500. Even if Intel advances to $23 – since the same factors typically drive stocks up or down in a specific sector – the strategy would still be profitable at $500, although much less so.
To get around the fact that stocks within a sector generally tend to move up or down in unison, long/short strategies frequently tend to use different sectors for the long and short legs. For example, if interest rates are rising, a hedge fund may short interest-sensitive sectors such as utilities, and go long on defensive sectors such as health care.

 Hedge Fund Strategy - Equity Long-Short
An  equity long-short strategy is an investing strategy, used primarily by hedge  funds, that involves taking long positions in stocks that are expected to  increase in value and short positions in stocks that are expected to decrease  in value.
You  may know that taking a long position in a stock simply means buying it: If the  stock increases in value, you will make money. On the other hand, taking a  short position in a stock means borrowing a stock you don’t own (usually from  your broker), selling it, then hoping it declines in value, at which time you  can buy it back at a lower price than you paid for it and return the borrowed  shares.
Hedge  funds using equity long-short strategies simply do this on a grander scale. At  its most basic level, an equity long-short strategy consists of buying an  undervalued stock and shorting an overvalued stock. Ideally, the long position  will increase in value, and the short position will decline in value. If this  happens, and the positions are of equal size, the hedge fund will benefit. That  said, the strategy will work even if the long position declines in value, provided  that the long position outperforms the short position. Thus, the goal of any  equity long-short strategy is to minimize exposure to the market in general,  and profit from a change in the difference, or spread, between two stocks. 
That  may sound complicated, so let’s look at a hypothetical example. Let’s say a  hedge fund takes a $1 million long position in Pfizer and a $1 million short  position in Wyeth, both large pharmaceutical companies. With these positions,  any event that causes all pharmaceutical stocks to fall will lead to a loss on  the Pfizer position and a profit on the Wyeth position. Similarly, an event  that causes both stocks to rise will have little effect, since the positions  balance each other out. So, the market risk is minimal. Why, then, would a  portfolio manager take such a position? Because he or she thinks Pfizer will  perform better than Wyeth. 
Equity  long-short strategies such as the one described, which hold equal dollar  amounts of long and short positions, are called market neutral strategies. But  not all equity long-short strategies are market neutral. Some hedge fund  managers will maintain a long bias, as is the case with so-called “130/30”  strategies. With these strategies, hedge funds have 130% exposure to long  positions and 30% exposure to short positions. Other structures are also used,  such as 120% long and 20% short. (Few hedge funds have a long-term short bias,  since the equity markets tend to move up over time.) 
Equity  long-short managers can also be distinguished by the geographic market in which  they invest, the sector in which they invest (financial, health care or  technology, for example) or their investment style (value or quantitative, for  example). Buying and selling two related stocks—for example, two stocks in the  same region or industry—is called a “paired trade” model. It may limit risk to  a specific subset of the market instead of the market in general.
Equity  long-short strategies have been used by sophisticated investors, such as  institutions, for years. They became increasingly popular among individual  investors as traditional strategies struggled in the most recent bear market,  highlighting the need for investors to consider expanding their portfolios into  innovative financial solutions.
   
  Equity  long-short strategies are not without risks. These strategies have all the  generic hedge fund risks: For example, hedge funds are typically not as liquid  as mutual funds, meaning it is more difficult to sell shares; the strategies  they use could lead to significant losses; and they can have high fees.  Additionally, equity long-short strategies have some unique risks. The main one  is that the portfolio manager must correctly predict the relative performance  of two stocks, which can be difficult. Another risk results from what is  referred to in the industry as “beta mismatch.” While this is more complicated  that we can explain in detail here, essentially, it means that 
when  the stock market declines sharply, long positions could lose more than short  positions. 
In  summary, equity long-short strategies may help increase returns in difficult  market environments, but also involve some risk. As a result, investors  considering these strategies may want to ensure that their hedge funds follow  strict rules to evaluate market risks and find good investment opportunities.
