(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, including the notes to those statements, included elsewhere in this quarterly report. We also recommend the following discussion be read in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis and consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Statements in the following discussion that are not statements of historical fact are "forward-looking statements." Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted in such forward-looking statements, for a variety of factors. See "Forward-Looking Statements" below.  References in this filing to the "Company," "Manhattan," "Manhattan Associates," "we," "our," and "us" refer to Manhattan Associates, Inc., our predecessors, and our wholly-owned and consolidated subsidiaries.  Business Overview  We develop, sell, deploy, service and maintain software solutions designed to manage supply chains, inventory and omni-channel operations for retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, logistics providers and other organizations. Our customers include many of the world's premier and most profitable brands.  Our business model is singularly focused on the development and implementation of complex commerce enablement software solutions that are designed to optimize supply chains, and retail store operations including point of sale effectiveness and efficiency for our customers. We have three principal sources of revenue:   licenses of our software;   professional services, including solutions planning and implementation, related consulting, customer training, and customer support services and software enhancements (collectively, "services"); and   hardware sales and other revenue.  In the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, we generated $154.1 million and $297.6 million in total revenue, respectively, with a revenue mix of: license revenue 14%; services revenue 76%; and hardware and other revenue 10% for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and license revenue 15%; services revenue 76%; and hardware and other revenue 9% for the six months ended June 30, 2017.  The Company has three geographic reportable segments: North America and Latin America (the "Americas"), Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Asia-Pacific (APAC). Geographic revenue is based on the location of the sale. Our international revenue was approximately $42.1 million and $83.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, which represents approximately 27% and 28% of our total revenue for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. International revenue includes all revenue derived from sales to customers outside the United States. At June 30, 2017, we employed approximately 2,900 employees worldwide, of which 1,370 employees are based in the Americas, 210 in EMEA, and 1,320 in APAC (including India). We have offices in Australia, Chile, China, France, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as representatives in Mexico and reseller partnerships in Latin America, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, South Africa, and Asia.  Global Economic Trends and Industry Factors  Global macro-economic trends, technology spending, and supply chain management market growth are important barometers for our business. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, approximately 73% and 72%, respectively of our total revenue was generated in the United States, 14% and 15%, respectively, in EMEA, and the remaining balance in APAC, Canada, and Latin America. In addition, Gartner Inc. ("Gartner"), an information technology research and advisory company, estimates that nearly 80% of every supply chain software solutions dollar invested is spent in the United States and Western Europe; consequently, the health of the U.S. and Western European economies has a meaningful impact on our financial results.  We sell technology-based solutions with total pricing, including software and services, in many cases exceeding $1.0 million. Our software often is a part of our customers' and prospects' much larger capital commitment associated with facilities expansion and business improvement. We believe that, given the lingering uncertainty in the global macro environment, the current sales cycles for large license deals of $1.0 million or greater in our target markets have been extended. The current business climate within the United States and the other geographic regions in which we operate continues to affect customers' and prospects' decisions regarding timing  of strategic capital expenditures. Delays with respect to such decisions can have a material adverse impact on our business, and may further intensify competition in our already highly competitive markets.  During 2016 and continuing into 2017, the overall trend has been steady for our large license deals, with recognized license revenue of $1.0 million or greater on eighteen new contracts during 2016 as well as eight new contracts in the six months ended June 30, 2017. While we are encouraged by our results, we, along with many of our customers, still remain cautious regarding the pace of global economic recovery. We believe global economic volatility likely will continue to shape customers' and prospects' enterprise software buying decisions, making it challenging to forecast sales cycles for our products and the timing of large enterprise software license deals.  Revenue  License revenue. License revenue, a leading indicator of our business, is primarily derived from software license fees customers pay for supply chain solutions. License revenue totaled $22.4 million, or 14% of total revenue, with gross margins of 89.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and $45.2 million, or 15% of total revenue, with gross margin of 89.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2017. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the percentage mix of new to existing customers was approximately 50/50.  License revenue growth is influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products. Our license revenue generally has long sales cycles and the timing of the closing of a few large license transactions can have a material impact on our quarterly license revenues, operating profit, operating margins, and earnings per share. For example, $1.1 million of license revenue in the second quarter of 2017 equates to approximately one cent of diluted earnings per share impact.  Our software solutions are focused on core supply chain commerce operations (Warehouse Management, Transportation Management, Labor Management), Inventory optimization and Omni-channel operations (e-commerce, retail store operations and point of sale), which are intensely competitive markets characterized by rapid technological change. We are a market leader in the supply chain management software solutions market as defined by industry analysts such as ARC Advisory Group and Gartner. Our goal is to extend our position as a leading global supply chain solutions provider by growing our license revenues faster than our competitors through investment in innovation. We expect to continue to face increased competition from Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Supply Chain Management applications vendors and business application software vendors that may broaden their solution offerings by internally developing, or by acquiring or partnering with independent developers of supply chain planning and execution software. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share.  Services revenue. Our services business consists of professional services (consulting and customer training) and customer support services and software enhancements (CSSE). Services revenue totaled $116.8 million, or 76% of total revenue, with gross margins of 59.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and $225.7 million, or 76% of total revenue, with gross margins of 56.8% for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Professional services accounted for approximately 69% of total services revenue in both the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. While we believe our services margins are very strong, our consolidated operating margin profile may be lower than those of various other technology companies due to our large services revenue mix as a percentage of total revenue as services margins are inherently lower than license revenue margins.  At June 30, 2017, our professional services organization totaled approximately 1,880 employees, accounting for 65% of our total employees worldwide. Our professional services organization provides our customers with expertise and assistance in planning and implementing our solutions. To ensure a successful product implementation, consultants assist customers with the initial installation of a system, the conversion and transfer of the customer's historical data onto our system, and ongoing training, education, and system upgrades. We believe our professional services enable customers to implement our software rapidly, ensure the customer's success with our solution, strengthen our customer relationships, and add to our industry-specific knowledge base for use in future implementations and product innovations.  Although our professional services are optional, the majority of our customers use at least some portion of these services for their planning, implementation, or related needs. Professional services are typically rendered under time and materials-based contracts with services typically billed on an hourly basis. Professional services are sometimes rendered under fixed-fee based contracts with payments due on specific dates or milestones.  Services revenue growth is contingent upon license revenue and customer upgrade cycles, which are influenced by the strength of general economic and business conditions and the competitive position of our software products. In addition, our professional  services business has competitive exposure to offshore providers and other consulting companies. All of these factors potentially create the risk of pricing pressure, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share.  For CSSE, we offer a comprehensive 24 hours per day, 365 days per year program that provides our customers with software upgrades, when and if available, which includes additional or improved functionality and technological advances incorporating emerging supply chain and industry initiatives. Our CSSE revenues totaled $36.0 million and $69.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, representing approximately 31% of services revenue and approximately 23% of total revenue for both periods. The growth of CSSE revenues is influenced by: (1) new license revenue growth; (2) annual renewal of support contracts; (3) increase in customers; and (4) fluctuations in currency rates. Substantially all of our customers renew their annual support contracts. Over the last three years, our annual revenue renewal rate of customers subscribing to comprehensive support and enhancements has been greater than 90%. CSSE revenue is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, typically twelve months. CSSE renewal revenue is not recognized unless payment is received from the customer.  Hardware and other revenue. Our hardware and other revenue totaled $14.9 million, representing 10% of total revenue with gross margins of 17.9% for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and $26.8 million, representing 9% of total revenue with gross margin of 18.3% for the six months ended June 30, 2017. In conjunction with the licensing of our software, and as a convenience for our customers, we resell a variety of hardware products developed and manufactured by third parties. These products include computer hardware, radio frequency terminal networks, RFID chip readers, bar code printers and scanners, and other peripherals. We resell all third-party hardware products and related maintenance pursuant to agreements with manufacturers or through distributor-authorized reseller agreements pursuant to which we are entitled to purchase hardware products and services at discounted prices. We generally purchase hardware from our vendors only after receiving an order from a customer. As a result, we generally do not maintain hardware inventory.  Other revenue represents amounts associated with reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket expenses. The total amount of expense reimbursement recorded to hardware and other revenue was $4.5 million and $8.8 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively.  Product Development  We continue to invest significantly in research and development (R&D) to provide leading solutions that help global manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, retailers, and logistics providers successfully manage accelerating and fluctuating demands as well as the increasing complexity and volatility of their local and global supply chains, retail store operations and point of sale. Our research and development expenses were $14.1 million and $28.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. At June 30, 2017, our R&D organization totaled approximately 690 employees, located in the U.S. and India.  We expect to continue to focus our R&D resources on the development and enhancement of our core supply chain, inventory optimization, omni-channel and point of sale software solutions. We offer what we believe to be the broadest solution portfolio in the supply chain solutions marketplace, to address all aspects of inventory optimization, transportation management, distribution management, planning, and omni-channel operations including order management, store inventory & fulfillment, call center and point of sale.  We also plan to continue to enhance our existing solutions and to introduce new solutions to address evolving industry standards and market needs. We identify opportunities to further enhance our solutions and to develop and provide new solutions through our customer support organization, as well as through ongoing customer consulting engagements and implementations, interactions with our user groups, association with leading industry analysts and market research firms, and participation on industry standards and research committees. Our solutions address the needs of customers in various vertical markets, including retail, consumer goods, food and grocery, logistics service providers, industrial and wholesale, high technology and electronics, life sciences, and government.  Cash Flow and Financial Condition  For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, we generated cash flow from operating activities of $11.3 million and $72.6 million, respectively. Our cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2017 totaled $86.6 million, with no debt on our balance sheet. We currently have no credit facilities. Our primary uses of cash continue to be funding investment in R&D and operations to drive earnings growth and repurchases of our common stock.  We repurchased 1,539,208 shares of Manhattan Associates' outstanding common stock under our repurchase program during the six months ended June 30, 2017. In July 2017, our Board of Directors approved raising the Company's remaining share repurchase authority to $50.0 million of Manhattan Associates' outstanding common stock.  For the remainder of 2017, we anticipate that our priorities for the use of cash will be in continued investment in product development and growth of the business. We expect to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities that are complementary to our product footprint and technology direction. We also expect to continue to weigh our share repurchase options against cash for acquisitions and investing in the business. We do not anticipate any borrowing requirements in the remainder of 2017 for general corporate purposes.  Results of Operations The following table summarizes our consolidated results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands, except per share data) Revenue $ 154,141 $ 154,892 $ 297,630 $ 304,752 Costs and expenses 104,882 102,624 206,651 209,385 Operating income 49,259 52,268 90,979 95,367 Other (loss) income, net (68 ) 654 (439 ) 1,174 Income before income taxes 49,191 52,922 90,540 96,541 Net income $ 31,144 $ 33,341 $ 59,368 $ 60,821 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.45 $ 0.46 $ 0.85 $ 0.84 Diluted weighted average number of shares 69,421 72,228 69,844 72,633  The Company has three geographic reportable segments: the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. Geographic revenue information is based on the location of sale. The revenues represented below are from external customers only. The geographical-based expenses include costs of personnel, direct sales, and marketing expenses, and general and administrative costs to support the business. There are certain corporate expenses included in the Americas segment that are not charged to the other segments, including research and development, certain marketing and general and administrative costs that support the global organization, and the amortization of acquired developed technology. Included in the Americas segment costs are all research and development costs, including the costs associated with the Company's India operations. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, we derived the majority of our revenues from sales to customers within our Americas segment. The following table summarizes revenue and operating profit by segment:   Three Months Ended June 30, Six Months Ended June 30, % Change vs. % Change vs. 2017 2016 Prior Year 2017 2016 Prior Year Revenue: (in thousands) (in thousands) Software license Americas $ 15,248 $ 17,261 -12 % $ 27,369 $ 36,293 -25 % EMEA 5,701 2,236 155 % 15,074 2,972 407 % APAC 1,493 1,134 32 % 2,772 1,973 40 % Total software license 22,442 20,631 9 % 45,215 41,238 10 % Services Americas 94,347 99,993 -6 % 184,059 197,371 -7 % EMEA 15,765 15,400 2 % 29,312 29,869 -2 % APAC 6,716 4,440 51 % 12,290 8,856 39 % Total services 116,828 119,833 -3 % 225,661 236,096 -4 % Hardware and Other Americas 14,063 13,764 2 % 25,345 26,161 -3 % EMEA 562 549 2 % 1,002 1,030 -3 % APAC 246 115 114 % 407 227 79 % Total hardware and other 14,871 14,428 3 % 26,754 27,418 -2 % Total Revenue Americas 123,658 131,018 -6 % 236,773 259,825 -9 % EMEA 22,028 18,185 21 % 45,388 33,871 34 % APAC 8,455 5,689 49 % 15,469 11,056 40 % Total revenue $ 154,141 $ 154,892 0 % $ 297,630 $ 304,752 -2 % Operating income: Americas $ 35,717 $ 44,126 -19 % $ 64,430 $ 81,580 -21 % EMEA 9,995 6,854 46 % 20,749 11,293 84 % APAC 3,547 1,288 175 % 5,800 2,494 133 % Total operating income $ 49,259 $ 52,268 -6 % $ 90,979 $ 95,367 -5 %  Summary of the Second Quarter 2017 Condensed Consolidated Financial Results   Diluted earnings per share was $0.45 in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $0.46 in the second quarter of 2016.   Consolidated total revenue was $154.1 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $154.9 million in the second quarter of 2016. License revenue was $22.4 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $20.6 million in the second quarter of 2016.   Operating income was $49.3 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $52.3 million in the second quarter of 2016.   Cash flow from operations was $11.3 million in the second quarter of 2017, compared to $19.1 million in the second quarter of 2016. Days sales outstanding was 57 days at June 30, 2017, compared to 53 days at March 31, 2017.   Cash and investments on-hand was $86.6 million at June 30, 2017, compared to $101.3 million at March 31, 2017.   During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we repurchased 535,340 shares of Manhattan Associates common stock, reducing shares of common stock outstanding by 1%, under the share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors, for a total investment of $25.0 million. In July 2017, our Board of Directors approved raising our share repurchase authority to an aggregate of $50.0 million of our outstanding common stock.  The consolidated results of our operations for the second quarters of 2017 and 2016 are discussed below.  Revenue Three Months Ended June 30, % Change vs. % of Total Revenue 2017 2016 Prior Year 2017 2016 (in thousands) Software license $ 22,442 $ 20,631 9 % 14 % 14 % Services 116,828 119,833 -3 % 76 % 77 % Hardware and other 14,871 14,428 3 % 10 % 9 % Total revenue $ 154,141 $ 154,892 0 % 100 % 100 %  Our revenue consists of fees generated from the licensing and hosting of software; fees from professional services, customer support services and software enhancements; hardware sales of complementary equipment; and other revenue representing amounts associated with reimbursements from customers for out-of-pocket expenses.  License revenue. License revenue increased $1.8 million, or 9%, in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in the prior year. Our license revenue performance depends on the number and relative value of large deals we close in the period. We recognized license revenue of $1.0 million or greater on four new separate contracts in the second quarter of 2017. The license sales percentage mix across our product suite in the second quarter ended June 30, 2017 was approximately 65% warehouse management solutions and 35% non-warehouse management solutions.  Services revenue. Services revenue decreased $3.0 million, or 3%, in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in the prior year due to a $6.1 million decrease in professional services revenue, partially offset by a $3.1 million increase in customer support and software enhancements. The decline in services revenue was primarily due to delays in implementation services, primarily in the retail market. Services revenue for the Americas segment decreased $5.7 million, and services revenue for the EMEA and APAC segments increased $0.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively, in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter of 2016.  Hardware and other. Hardware sales increased by $0.9 million to $10.4 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $9.5 million for the second quarter of 2016. The majority of hardware sales are derived from our Americas segment. Sales of hardware are largely dependent upon customer-specific desires, which fluctuate. Other revenue represents reimbursements for professional service travel expenses that are required to be classified as revenue and are included in hardware and other revenue. Reimbursements by customers for out-of-pocket expenses were approximately $4.5 million and $4.9 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Cost of Revenue Three Months Ended June 30, % Change vs. 2017 2016 Prior Year Cost of license $ 2,355 $ 2,283 3 % Cost of services 47,751 48,393 -1 % Cost of hardware and other 12,207 11,841 3 % Total cost of revenue $ 62,313 $ 62,517 0 %  Cost of license. Cost of license consists of the costs associated with software reproduction; hosting services; media, packaging and delivery, documentation, and other related costs; and royalties on third-party software sold with or as part of our products. Cost of license increased by $0.1 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter of 2016.  Cost of services. Cost of services consists primarily of salaries and other personnel-related expenses of employees dedicated to professional and technical services and customer support services. The $0.6 million, or 1%, decrease in cost of services in the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same quarter in the prior year was principally due a 0.9 million decrease in performance-based compensation offset by a $0.4 million increase in compensation and other-personnel related expenses due to the timing of the collection of a tax credit.  Cost of hardware and other. Cost of hardware and other increased by $0.4 million . . .  Jul 24, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved
