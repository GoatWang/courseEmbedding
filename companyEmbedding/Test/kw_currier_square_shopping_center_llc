Description



Thank you for making this the #1 Windows calculator!  We're honored to have your support.  An ad-free version, named "Calculator!", is now available by popular demand - enjoy!

I'm Calculator Free - the perfect calculator for Windows 8.  Snap me, turn me, or let me fill the whole screen with four beautiful nature themes.  I'm easy to use and artfully designed to do things better than your desktop calculator ever did.

I love saving you time and effort.  I easily Copy and Paste values to and from other apps.  I always remember what you're working on, so if you need to quit and go do something else, I'll have it all waiting for you when you come back.  Even better, my Live Tile updates constantly, so you can always see your last result at a glance, right from your Start Screen.

I'm attractive and effective and I make great use of your Windows 8 display.  If you feel like a change of scene, just tap one of the color theme buttons at the top of the screen.

Lastly, you can say goodbye to losing track of where you are in a calculation - I show you exactly what's happening at all times, in clear, elegant type.  If you do make a mistake, use backspace to quickly correct it, instead of starting over

Try me today and finally put that desktop calculator to rest!

This app is ad-funded.  For an ad-free experience, download the "Calculator!" app.

Awesome looking


            Love this calculator. Numbers are large, which is very nice. Gave it 4 stars.  I would love more themes and be able to minimize it within a second screen.

It's great!


            I like the size (the numbers are so big and easy to read) and the convenience of this calculator. It comes in handy when I'm sitting at my computer - I can just click on the icon and it comes right up.

Free Calculator


            I enjoy the background images and the calculator is accurate however its very slow. There is a delay between my putting in a number and the number showing up on the calculator, theres also a delay when you hit any of the other buttons (plus, times, equals - you get the picture).

Our Story
Our Business
From our humble beginnings as a small discount retailer in Rogers, Ark., Walmart has opened thousands of stores in the U.S. and expanded internationally. Through innovation, we're creating a seamless experience to let customers shop anytime and anywhere online, through mobile devices and in stores. We are creating opportunities and bringing value to customers and communities around the globe.

Walmart operates over 11,700 retail units under 59 banners in 28 countries and e-commerce websites in 11 countries. We employ approximately 2.3 million associates around the world — 1.5 million in the U.S. alone.






Walmart U.S.






Every day low prices on a broad assortment - anytime, anywhere.Every
 Day Low Price (EDLP) is the cornerstone of our strategy, and our price 
focus has never been stronger. Today's customer seeks the convenience of
 one-stop shopping that we offer. From grocery and entertainment to 
sporting goods and crafts, we provide the deep assortment that our 
customers appreciate -- whether they're shopping online at Walmart.com, through one of our mobile apps or
 shopping in a store. We currently operate three primary store formats 
in the U.S., each custom tailored to its neighborhood. Greg Foran is Walmart U.S. President & CEO.Working at WalmartA job at Walmart means an opportunity to build a career. About
 75% of our store management teams started as hourly associates, and 
last year, we promoted about 200,000 people to jobs with more 
responsibility and higher pay. In the U.S., the average, full-time 
hourly wage is $13.39. Learn more about the opportunities and benefits we offer, as well as our commitment to hire 250,000 veterans.Community GivingWalmart gives back to every community in which it serves. Learn more about the Walmart Foundation and our $2 billion commitment to fight hunger in the U.S.Environmental SustainabilityWalmart is the largest onsite green power generator in the U.S. Learn more about our sustainability initiatives in the United States and around the world.Our StoresWalmart has stores in 50 states and Puerto Rico offering low prices on the broadest assortment of products through a variety of formats including the Supercenter, Discount Store and Neighborhood Market. 






Walmart Supercenter

Walmart began building Supercenters in 1988 and are around 182,000 square 
feet employing about 300 associates. Walmart Supercenters offer a 
one-stop shopping experience by combining a grocery store with fresh produce, bakery, deli and dairy products with electronics, apparel, toys and home 
furnishings. Most Supercenters are
 open 24 hours, and may also include specialty shops such as banks, hair and nail salons, restaurants, or vision centers.






Walmart Discount Store

Since Sam Walton opened his first discount store in Rogers, Ark., in 
1962, we've built hundreds across the U.S. Smaller than a Supercenter, 
discount stores employ about 200 associates and offer electronics, 
apparel, toys, home furnishings, health and beauty aids, hardware and 
more in about 106,000 square feet of open, brightly lit space.






Walmart Neighborhood Market

Walmart Neighborhood Markets were designed in 1998 as a 
smaller-footprint option for communities in need of a pharmacy, 
affordable groceries and merchandise. Each one is approximately 38,000 
square feet and employs up to 95 associates. Walmart Neighborhood 
Markets offer fresh produce, meat and dairy products, bakery and deli 
items, household supplies, health and beauty aids and a pharmacy.




Distribution CentersWalmart's 150+ distribution centers are hubs of activity for our business. Our 
distribution operation is one of the largest in the world servicing stores, clubs and direct delivery to customers. Walmart 
transportation has a fleet of 6,100 tractors, 61,000 trailers and more than 
7,800 drivers.The distribution center network ships general merchandise, dry groceries, perishable groceries, along with other specialty categories to our consumers daily.There are 6 disaster distribution centers, strategically 
located across the country and stocked to provide rapid response to 
struggling communities in the event of a natural disaster.Each 
distribution center is more than 1 million square feet in size and employs 600+ personnel unloading and shipping over 200 trailers daily.Every distribution center supports 90 to 100 stores in a 150+ mile radius.Our FleetWalmart
 is able to move goods to and from distribution centers because we 
maintain a private fleet of trucks and a skilled staff of truck drivers.
 We think our team of drivers is the best in the world. They're part of 
one of the largest and safest fleets, and every year they drive 700 
million miles to make millions of deliveries to our stores and clubs. 
Each driver averages around 100,000 miles annually-that's like driving 
around the world 4 times!


Together
 with our truck drivers, we're constantly working to ensure that we're 
moving merchandise in responsible, sustainable ways. Drivers follow the 
most efficient routes to their destinations, and work to minimize the 
number of "empty miles" they drive. This way, we use less fuel, we drive
 fewer miles and we maximize the merchandise we deliver while minimizing
 our environmental impact.By reducing the "empty miles" driven and other optimization techniques, Walmart logistics hauled over 161 million more cases while only increasing miles by 24 million, compared to last year. We improved the efficiency of our truck fleet by 87.4% in 2014 compared to 2005. Learn more about our sustainability efforts.

                        Leveraging partnerships will be key to business success in 2017
                    






09 Jan 2017
Interview with Hussein Hachem, Aramex CEO


                           2016 will go down as one of the most unprecedented years in history. From the UK’s decision to leave the EU, to the Presidential election in the United States, there were historic political and economic upsets that caught many by surprise. Global markets and stock exchanges are still struggling to cope, and as we enter the New Year, it is clear that 2017 will also be challenging.
The one thing that has remained relatively constant in the midst of these unpredictable times is consumer demand. While the world goes through fundamental changes, the need for the efficient and effective movement of goods and services has not changed. At Aramex our focus has been to stay alert, responsive and agile to meet these demands, and we have succeeded.
Why have we been able to navigate these turbulent times?
Innovation in technology. This has been the underlying reason why we have been able to keep pace with changing consumer preferences. In 2016 we launched our mobile app for consumers to improve our customers’ experience, giving them the option to live track their package, make in-app payments and schedule deliveries. We also partnered with what3words, the global address system, to reach more customers in off-the-grid locations. Technology is ultimately behind every fundamental business decision we make and is critical to the growth of our e-commerce business and global footprint. Other companies have also leveraged technology to succeed, with Uber, Air BnB and UAE company Careem using platforms to aggregate data, predict consumer behaviour and develop new and innovative products and services.
And while we can celebrate these achievements, the harsh reality is that technological innovation is now essential. If you are a business and want to compete, having innovative technologies is no longer an option, it is a requirement. But as we move into an unpredictable 2017, I believe the recipe for business success calls for a different order. Innovation in technology alone will no longer be enough to navigate the current environment - businesses must do more.
In my opinion, businesses must pursue strategic partnerships while continuing to leverage innovative technologies. We partnered with Australia Post this year to give us reach across all post offices worldwide. Partnerships are important because they give companies unique opportunities to further leverage their technologies, such as long-term personal relationships with new business partners, local market insights, expanded product and service portfolios and even future business deals. We aren’t the only company to have taken this idea on board. Careem recently partnered with the Roads and Transport Authority and Deliveroo to allow customers to book RTA cars and order food through their app.
Ironically, technology has always played an important role in enabling communication, as we wouldn’t often be able to connect with other companies without it. Yet in today’s environment, pursuing synergistic partnerships also allows businesses to leverage technology more effectively. Today, Aramex exports our technologies to new business partners and integrates other business’ platforms into our operations. New partnerships also make us more cost effective by outsourcing logistics services to third party suppliers who have the appropriate technologies in place. Our e-commerce platform has also benefitted from more partnerships with online shopping vendors who have the necessary technological hardware.
With all of this in mind, one thing remains very clear. Companies are succeeding by disrupting their business models through innovation in technology. But moving forward the key to more success in 2017 will be how companies leverage strategic partnerships to help them adapt to global market uncertainty, take advantage of innovative technologies and capitalize on opportunities for growth.
The author is Hussein Hachem, CEO of Aramex, a leading global logistics and transportation solutions company in Dubai.

                    Warehousing is an integral part of our business and wider supply chain. We, at Aramex, therefore decided to propose a separate state-of-the-art facility for Dangerous Goods (HazMat) storage in Dubai South free zone area - not only to ensure the health and safety of our people, but also due to the high volume of demand to further enhance our storage capacity.
