What Our Customers Say

 We surveyed members who have used the club in the last 90 days to get input on facility and equipment upgrades ... 46% of people voted for the Cleaning station, making it #2 choice over “all” equipment, over iPod charges on cardio, over a membership rewards program, over Coffee service, over an updated website. Wow! ... Considering the low price of these units, it’s the best bang for the buck we will spend this year, hands down!!!

 Who are we? 
 
 Clean Tech  Innovations is a Research & Development (R & D) company that has provided quality products and services to customers for years.  We are based in Bartlesville Oklahoma yet our customer’s products and services are used and promoted world-wide.     
 Our mission statement: 
 "We develop Technically Innovative products for our customers using  commitments to Environmental Responsibility, Cost-Effectiveness, Quality and a  Safe Environment." 
 
 Technology innovation is a process where a new method, idea,  product, or improvements to the process are developed for use to the point of  creating value. Innovation takes this process through the stages of research,  development, demonstration, and deployment. This often involves collaborative  efforts between a range of organizations and personnel such as private or  public laboratories, institutions, financial organizations, or government  regulatory organizations.  Two technical  innovation areas of interest to Clean Tech Innovations LLC are the Energy and  the Environmental sectors. 
 There are many technical innovation similarities and many differences  in these two sectors.  Technical  innovation occurs in the energy sector by providing new or improved methods,  ideas, or products aimed at expanding the exploration and production capacity  and efficiency in extraction, conversion and use while reducing environmental  impacts. Technical innovation in the energy sector is market driven with clear  commercial applications and providing financial returns. 
 Many  product environmental regulatory compliance frameworks have now matured to the  point that not only directly driving technical innovation in products  and product development processes. They are also providing system  designers and product development professionals with exciting new opportunities  to reduce product costs, development costs, and improve  time-to-market.  The application of Lean  principles to product regulatory and risk management is an example of  innovative product development methods, where focus on identification and  elimination of project waste provides direct cost benefits within the product  and across the product development lifecycle.

What is wind energy?


Wind energy refers to the electricity generated from turbines that are spun by wind power alone.











How does wind energy work?


Imagine a fan, but reversed. Instead of using electricity to power a fan’s blades, a wind turbine uses the power of wind to generate electricity. The spinning blades turn a shaft that connects to a rotor. This action is what produces electricity.












What are the benefits of wind energy?






Creates an influx of quality jobs: a jump from around 700,000 currently to over 1 million by 2025





Reduces the costs spent on importing fossil fuels so those dollars can support domestic infrastructure



Provides incentives for new businesses to invest in areas covered by clean energy due to available lower operational costs












What's a REC?

Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are tradable, non-tangible energy commodities that demonstrate 1 megawatt-hour (MWh) of energy was produced from a wind farm.
The more RECs that are purchased, the more valuable clean energy generation becomes, leading to more production and more renewable energy on the grid.












What happens when I switch to clean energy with Inspire?







We purchase renewable energy certificates from local, regional and/or national wind farms on your behalf to offset the energy that you consume every month.






Your utility company will still deliver the energy to your house, read your meters, and send you your bill. We are listed as the supplier and there is nothing else you have to do.






Your home or business will actively support more clean power getting into the grid without needing to change your lifestyle. It’s as simple as that!






























I never realized that taking one small step could make such a big difference. I wish everything in life could be this simple.

New Jersey Energy Link

















You may know that New Jersey has the 7th highest electricity rates in the United States. Do you know why? 

A single utility controls roughly one-half the generation in the state and an alarming 88% of the
power plants in New Jersey’s most populated and power hungry northern area.  Ratepayers are
missing the savings of a freely-operating, competitive market. 

What’s it worth? Ratepayers could be saving as much as $475 million in just one year, if a new backbone transmission
line were built to give competing power plants better access to the market.

New Jersey can tackle high energy costs by approving the New Jersey Energy Link project. This high-capacity backbone transmission line links south Jersey, which is part of a
highly-competitive, multi-state energy market, with north Jersey, which needs more power
supply.   This pro-consumer project is backed by innovators, including Google, who have
designed an advanced transmission system buried underground and under the seabed where it is
protected from storms and free of NIMBY opposition.

New Jersey Energy Link combats high-cost power and advances other energy goals by:



Lowering utility bills for New Jersey homes and businesses by $1.4 billion,
Storm-hardening the State’s electric grid to make it stronger in the face of severe weather, and
Creating many jobs for New Jersey workers.

Grid Congestion Causes High Electricity Prices In New Jersey



New Jersey has the 5th highest electricity rates in the United States.


New Jersey residents and businesses pay high electricity rates primarily because
the electric grid is “congested”.


Congestion on the electric grid is like a traffic jam along the highway
preventing low-cost power from reaching high-demand, high-cost areas. In these areas
where it is more difficult and expensive to move electricity – like northern New
Jersey – ratepayers pay “congestion charges,” a hidden cost added to their bill.


And, because congestion prevents low-cost power from reaching these areas, ratepayers
are forced to pay for expensive and dirty power from local “peaker plants.”


This raises the average price of power well above that of neighboring states like
Pennsylvania.

If grid congestion is like a traffic jam along the highway…


The New Jersey Energy Link is like an efficient HOV lane for New Jersey’s power.


The New Jersey Energy Link will serve as an offshore bypass for grid congestion, delivering New Jersey’s power reliably to where it’s needed the most and relieving costly congestion on the grid.


Utilities will need to use dirty “peaker” plants less often, and residents will enjoy lower rates.

Strengthening the Resiliency and Security of New Jersey’s Power Grid











New Jersey’s Power Grid Vulnerabilities



Electricity is essential to powering and securing New Jersey’s homes, businesses,
and economic growth.


For New Jersey to meet its economic goals and create jobs now and into the future,
the power grid must provide reliable, low-cost electricity to the people and businesses
that depend on it.


But New Jersey’s power grid is aging. Some lines being replaced today are over 80
years old. The power grid in northern New Jersey is particularly vulnerable, creating
a “traffic jam” preventing low-cost power from reaching high-demand, high-cost areas
in northern New Jersey.

A Smart Investment In New Jersey’s Power Grid



The New Jersey Energy Link will help ensure a reliable supply of electricity by
allowing lower-cost power to flow more freely to where it is needed, when it is
needed.


The New Jersey Energy Link will serve as an offshore bypass to the electricity “traffic
jam” preventing cleaner and more economical power from reaching consumers.


The New Jersey Energy Link unleashes the surplus of low-cost power from southern New Jersey and the highly-competitive, multi-state energy market outside of New Jersey, to be directly delivered directly to areas of high demand.

According to a report by The Chertoff Group, the New Jersey Energy will lessen the
potential impacts of a natural disaster, accident, or terrorist attack.


Transmission lines are frequently disrupted or brought down by heavy wind and rain, as well as ice
and snow, because they are above ground and
vulnerable to these elements. Downed transmission lines cause loss of power to residents and
businesses. The New Jersey Energy Link
transmission line is less vulnerable to such weather variations because it is buried in the seabed
and underground, where it is protected from the
elements.


The New Jersey Energy Link will also help the power grid to recuperate and restore
power faster after a blackout.


If the region’s power grid goes down through natural or man made means, the New
Jersey Energy would help to reenergize the grid by providing the power needed to
re-start electricity generating plants and restore power to New Jersey’s homes,
businesses, and essential public services like government buildings, police stations,
and hospitals.

By making New Jersey’s Port of Paulsboro the construction hub for the New Jersey
Energy Link, 500 – 600 jobs will be created in Paulsboro, plus an additional 1,100
jobs throughout the State to construct the New Jersey Energy Link.


In the future when New Jersey moves forward with offshore wind, The New Jersey Energy Link will create the foundation for offshore wind farm construction for 3,000 megawatts. The New Jersey Energy Link also creates the foundation for offshore wind farm construction
for 3,000 megawatts (about 600 wind turbines) over a decade or longer. According
to a study by IHS Global Insight, building offshore wind and the New Jersey Energy
Link will:

Create up to 20,000 jobs for New Jersey workers
Pump $9 billion into New Jersey’s economy
Bolster state and local tax revenues by $2.2 billion

Least Expensive Solution



The New Jersey Energy Link’s high-capacity transmission line allows
offshore wind to be delivered at a substantially lower cost to ratepayers than individual
“radial” lines by:



Utilizing few cables
Lowering costs of wind farms
Delivering offshore wind energy to northern New Jersey, where the demand for electricity
    is greatest






LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE FUTURE





Least Expensive Solution


New Jersey Energy Link uses advanced High-Voltage Direct-Current (HVDC) technology
that is capable of moving more power using fewer cables.





 

Individual “radial” lines use Alternating-Current (AC) technology that move less
power than the NJEL’s HVDC line, and thus require many more expensive cables to
move the same amount of energy.







LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE FUTURE






Least Expensive Solution

New Jersey Energy Link makes it easier to permit wind farms, thereby
reducing wind farm costs and delays.


By connecting offshore to the New Jersey Energy Link, wind farm
developers only need to obtain 1 permit.


Connecting to shore with radial lines would require each wind farm
developer to acquire 10 permits.

“Another way the New Jersey Energy Link reduces the cost of offshore wind development is by
allowing offshore wind energy to be delivered to northern New Jersey, where the demand for
electricity is greatest and electricity prices are highest. Because individual “radial” lines
cannot reach northern New Jersey, this benefit is exclusive to the New Jersey Energy Link


By delivering offshore wind to its highest value market, the New Jersey Energy Link increases the
revenues earned by wind developers for offshore wind energy, which lowers the subsidy for offshore
wind that is needed from ratepayers through the state’s Offshore Renewable Energy Credit (OREC)
program.”

Working 100% Of The Time – The Better Investment For New Jersey



With the New Jersey Energy Link, New Jersey is getting a transmission
line that not only moves wind power from off the coast to shore, but that can also
move New Jersey’s energy resources up and down the State, when the wind isn’t blowing.



A wind farm connected to shore with “radial” lines will only move power when the
    wind is blowing. That’s about 40% of the time.
The New Jersey Energy Link is a better investment for New Jersey because it doesn’t just
    link offshore wind farms to shore, but also link’s
    New Jersey’s on-land energy resources and will deliver them efficiently, up and down the state.
    This means the New Jersey Energy Link is
    working and moving power 100% of the time.

Case Study: European Experience



Though the United States has yet to erect a single wind turbine offshore, Europe
has decades of experience developing offshore wind, providing the U.S. offshore
wind industry with valuable learning lessons.


In Europe, developers of the first wind farms built their own radial transmission
lines to shore. Although this approach might have made sense at the time, the European
wind industry realized this sort of “spaghetti” cable network is expensive (the
more connections, the higher the cost), is not environmentally friendly and is far
from ideal when connecting large-scale offshore wind.


Many European developers have since been moving away from individual radial lines
and towards an integrated “supergrid”, which will connect several wind farms and
nations to an high-capacity offshore grid.
