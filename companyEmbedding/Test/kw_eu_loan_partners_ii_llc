May 10, 2017 04:02 PM Eastern Daylight Time



RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--TransEnterix, Inc. (NYSE MKT:TRXC) (the “Company”), a medical device 
      company that is pioneering the use of robotics to improve minimally 
      invasive surgery, today announced that it has entered into a debt 
      financing agreement with an affiliate of Innovatus Capital Partners, LLC 
      ("Innovatus") to provide the Company with up to $17.0 million in term 
      loans.
    


      "We are pleased to partner with Innovatus for our debt financing needs," 
      said Todd M. Pope, President and Chief Executive Officer of 
      TransEnterix. "In conjunction with our recently completed equity 
      transaction, this capital will allow us to continue our 
      commercialization efforts in Europe, focus on the Senhance 510(k) 
      clearance process and expand our U.S. market development efforts. 
      Innovatus has proven to be a flexible and committed capital provider at 
      this critical stage of growth."
    

      On May 10, 2017, the Company entered into a loan and security agreement 
      (the "Loan Agreement") with Innovatus pursuant to which Innovatus has 
      agreed to make certain term loans in the aggregate principal amount of 
      up to $17.0 million, with the funding of the first $14.0 million tranche 
      expected to occur upon satisfaction of customary funding conditions. The 
      Company will be eligible to draw on the second tranche of $3,000,000 
      upon achievement of certain milestones, including clearance for 
      commercialization of Senhance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      (“Senhance Clearance”). The Company is entitled to make interest-only 
      payments for twenty-four months so long as it meets certain milestones, 
      including Senhance Clearance by May 30, 2018. The loans will mature on 
      the earlier of (i) the fourth anniversary of the initial funding date 
      and (ii) twenty-four (24) months following the failure to achieve such 
      interest-only milestones. The Loan Agreement includes customary warrant 
      coverage and is secured by all of the Company’s, and its domestic and 
      material foreign subsidiaries’, assets. The Company fully repaid its 
      term loans with Silicon Valley Bank and Oxford Finance LLC on May 10, 
      2017. Proceeds will be used for general corporate and working capital 
      purposes.
    

      "Innovatus is excited about the participation of TransEnterix in the 
      future use of robotics in the medical field with the Senhance Surgical 
      Robotic System," said Andrew Dym, co-founder and President of Innovatus. 
      "Providing capital to such a pioneering and innovative company is a 
      strategic priority for Innovatus and we look forward to continuing our 
      relationship for years to come."
    

      Additional details regarding the Company's financing are included in the 
      Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K which is expected to be filed on or 
      about May 10, 2017 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

June 19--BiondVax Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: BVXV; (TASE:BVXV), which is developing a universal vaccine for all strains of influenza, today announced the signing of an agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) for a euro20 million ($22 million) loan. The money will be used to fund a Phase III trial (a multi-center effectiveness trial) for BiondVax's product. The company has been ready for the trial for several years already, but did not start it because of a lack of money, among other reasons. The company's share price jumped 2.25% on the news today, boosting its market cap to NIS 123 million.
The EIB is the European Union's (EU) long-term lending institution, which offers long-term financing for investments that contribute to EU policy goals. Its support for development of the BiondVax vaccine was part of the Horizon 2020 initiative, the EU's research program, in which Israeli is also participating. The loan is being granted in the InnovFin Infectious Diseases framework, designed for budgeting high-risk infectious disease projects.
BiondVax has conducted Phase II trials, which showed that its vaccine is safe, and that combining it with a seasonal vaccine can extend the seasonal vaccine's coverage. The company previously stated that it was likely to enter the market with its product as improving the seasonal vaccine, but its long-term vision is to offer a single vaccine that will offer protection against influenza for many years.
Ruth Arnon developed, Nacht invested
The EU previously funded a BiondVax Phase IIb trial as part of its Seventh Framework Programme for technological research and development.
BiondVax CEO Dr. Ron Babecoff said, "We now have the resources required to launch Phase III clinical trials, and to set up a medium-sized plant for commercial production. The EIB's financing is therefore a huge step forward for BiondVax on the way to bringing the M-001 vaccine to market."
BiondVax was founded by Babecoff, who acquired the technology on which the company's product is based from the Weizmann Institute of Science, where it was developed by Professor Ruth Arnon, one of the developers of Copaxone, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.'s (NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) drug for treatment of multiple sclerosis. Several months ago, BiondVax obtained an investment from aMoon Partners, a company controlled by Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq: CHKP) cofounder Marius Nacht. aMoon now has a 19% stake in BiondVax, making it the sole significant shareholder in the company.
