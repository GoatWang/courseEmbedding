I wish they would have spent more time on character development at the beginning. If you haven't read the books, you will have a little hard time figuring out what and who everyone is. You will settle into it however.I do believe this movie could have been so much better with a higher budget. I am really looking forward to a second movie and if enough fans of the series continue to rate the movie (even higher than it deserves...because of budget restrictions) then I hope the next movie has a higher budget. The series is wonderful and deserves to be made into movies.As an adult I read the series and got my kids into it as well and we got to share this together...books first and then movie. If you haven't read the books...you should...adults and kids!!!Read more11 comment|

Please try againBySabrinaon September 19, 2016Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseAs a die hard lover of this book series I was disappointed. I waited so many years for a movie to be made and really wished Patterson would've let the big guys do this one instead of a small off Hollywood production team (even though no movie could ever do this book series justice) because you only see two of the kids ever take flight and i was really hoping to see all of them together in the sky fooling around like they do in the books.The ending definately was not up to par along with awkward fade to black transitions between scenes. Im normally not picky to movies but i expected A LOT for my favorite series. I understand the budget was low so I'm not going to complain but if I had to choose between waiting another 3 years for a movie with a bigger budget for all the special effects, I would've waited.On a better note, I was all in all really happy to be sitting all cuddled in my favorite chair watching a Maximum Ride film. I'm so happy one finally came out because this series NEEDS movies. It's that good I recommend everyone reads them. I hope they get some more money and make a BETTER second oneRead more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsGood Film When the Low Budget is ConsideredByMikayla  F Holdenon September 2, 2016Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseWhen I found out that there was going to be a Maximum Ride movie, I went in to it with a bit of skepticism. I'd watched movies before where the plot, the characters, and the overall story of the books they portrayed had been butchered. I didn't feel that this was the case with this movie. Some of the shots taken for the film were absolutely breath taking! The acting by Gavin Lewis (Gazzy), Tetona Jackson (Nudge), and Zayne Emory (Iggy) was great! I'm not going to complain about how "their wings came from their backs when needed" or "Max's too blonde hair or Fang's chatty personality" because not everything in a movie can be perfect. The wings were undoubtedly due to the fact that it's way easier to film like that. The only thing I really wished to be better in this movie was 1) The marketing as it was virtually nonexistent and 2) that it would have had a better budget. There is no doubt that the CGI effects were horrible but I feel that if there had been a larger budget, the movie would have had better effects. But, it was a good movie for the budget it was given. I would definitely watched another!Read more0Comment|

It felt like the movie ended half way through, I mean technically it did if you ever read the book it didn't even make it to the half way mark of the book. So this movie just felt like a really long trailer. Major waste of time don't bother unless you want to be let down.Plot: Six children genetically cross-bred with avian DNA, take flight around the world to discover their origin.Parents guide: A few fight scenesRead more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse3.0 out of 5 starsEh.ByAmazon Customeron August 30, 2016Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseI‚Äôm very conflicted on this movie. I was really excited for it, despite knowing that it was low budget. Overall, it was eh. The special effects were terrible, but that‚Äôs excusable. My main problem was the lack of character development, especially with Fang and Angel. Some of the actors fit their characters well, and some don‚Äôt. The plot was good enough to keep me interested for an hour and a half, but full of cliches. I have read all of the Maximum Ride books, and if I had not, I would have been much more confused. It‚Äôs not very accurate to The Angel Experiment (which I‚Äôm assuming it is based upon), but is very connected to it. Personally, I think that Allie Evans was the best actress in the film, especially towards the end. Ultimately, it‚Äôs worth it to watch if one is a book fan, but don‚Äôt expect too much.Read more0Comment|

The pacing is terrible, the acting ranges from competent to horrid, the production and fx quality is barely of B movie/indy film standards and I didn't bother to look up the DP, but the camera work was just sad and amateurish. Don't even get me started on the directing.If you loved the book, do yourself a favor and don't sully the narrative and imagery you have in your mind's eye with this crap. Trust me - your brain did better camera work.Read more0Comment|

  Was this review helpful to you?YesNoReport abuse5.0 out of 5 starsGrade A - B movie :)ByTrichon September 28, 2016Format: Amazon Video|Verified PurchaseDisclaimer- its a B style movie with some bigger budget flair. So, if Transformers CGI is the only satisfactory work to you, you may not like this one. If strong acting performances is your good/bad line of demarcation- you may not make it 10 minutes into this one. For all hardcore sci-fi junkies into Dark Angel/Hit Man/genetically alerted as a kid and now have an axe to grind type movies please proceed with glee.Simple sci-fi plot. Nothing special, but great effort. No real new ground being broken, but they did- what they did very well. High marks all around for presentation. I enjoyed it. Wish there was a MR number two.Read more0Comment|

Let‚Äôs look at the processes and the list of necessary equipment together. We are ready to offer you the necessary equipment.










  




























  






1. Manual cleaning and bulkhead of cocoa beans. One of the most important operations ‚Äî removal of small stones and twigs, which can damage the equipment when it hits into the working parts. For your convenience, we produce a professional backlit sieve for manual cleaning of cocoa beans.
2. Roasting. You may use any convection oven, or roast cacao beans in the oven. At the moment, the market offers a wide range of ovens of various capacities.
3. Crushing and separation. Use our unique Crusher-Separator CD2, created to grind the cocoa beans and to separate of cocoa-groats from cocoa-vella (husks). Average output of cocoa-groats is 88-90% of the loaded volume of cocoa beans (10-12% is cocoa-vella). A content of the cocoa-vella in the final product (the cocoa-groats) is 1.5-2%. The rated output of the Machine is up to 20 kg per hour. Data is given for results after two or three passes (process repeats). The data may vary depending on the variety, fat content and degree of roast cocoa beans.
4. Grinding / Conching. The advantage of our equipment is the simultaneous execution of two technological processes necessary for the preparation of cocoa mass ‚Äî grinding cocoa-groats and conching. Conching in our Melangers begins right from the first hours of work, at the same time as grinding. The construction of our Melangeers allows you to preserve the finest shades of flavor of aromatic cocoa beans. Wherein, the conching machine as a separate device is NOT REQUIRED.
5. Filtration of the mass. Use our Vibro-filter VT! This is a most high-performance and —Åost-effective machine in its class!
6. Forming of the untempered masses. You will need a gastronorm container and a refrigerator.
7. Tempering. As long as you work on small volumes of output (2-3 kg per day) you can perform tempering manually, in which case you need a granite table. If you intend to produce chocolate in batches, we recommend using a tamper-machine. Nowadays, the market offers a wide range of tempering machines from various manufacturers.
8. Forming and packaging of the final product. From your needs and at your discretion.






  






GRINDING GRANITE-ON-GRANITEIn the functional basis of our melangers is the principle of product grinding granite-on-granite.
And exactly this idea was at the heart of the first melangers in history!

The Melanger 80 kg consists of support frame and tilting module with rotating bowl all made of food grade stainless steel AISI 304 and two millstones and the base each made of a whole piece of high density natural granite. This specific tilting design facilitates the effective chocolate mass discharge by tilting the bowl via the motor-reducer motion. The rotation of the bowl is effected via motor-reducer, and the two rolling millstones are pressed against the granite base of the bowl by the two independent pneumatic cylinders. The Melanger requires connection to compressed air supply. The bowl rotation speed, the stones pressure and inclination of the turning module are controlled from control panel. SLIM execution (74cm) allows getting through any standard door.
