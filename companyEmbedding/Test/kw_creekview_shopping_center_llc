Homes Crafted With A
Legacy of Quality


The Name Behind the Dream®

In 1959 our Founder, Kevork S. Hovnanian (pictured with his son, Ara), came to a new land with a dream: to build a home for his family, and for all families seeking a better life. Although we were greatly saddened by his passing in 2009, his dream inspires us every day, and his integrity and legacy continue to guide us as we come together to build homes and communities for each and every family who puts their trust in us. It is a privilege to share our story with you.

A Message
From our CEO

I'm Ara Hovnanian, CEO and Chairman of Hovnanian Enterprises®, Inc. Thank you for your interest in our new homes and communities. I am delighted you are considering K. Hovnanian® Homes to be the builder of your new home. Having grown up in the business my father started back in 1959, I spent my summers in our communities, sweeping out houses and learning about construction, land development and other fascinating aspects of the business.  I guess you could say that homebuilding is "in my blood." The strength of a home is its foundation. The strength of our Company is our people. It would be my Company's honor to build your new home for you.

Description



Thank you for making this the #1 Windows calculator!  We're honored to have your support.  An ad-free version, named "Calculator!", is now available by popular demand - enjoy!

I'm Calculator Free - the perfect calculator for Windows 8.  Snap me, turn me, or let me fill the whole screen with four beautiful nature themes.  I'm easy to use and artfully designed to do things better than your desktop calculator ever did.

I love saving you time and effort.  I easily Copy and Paste values to and from other apps.  I always remember what you're working on, so if you need to quit and go do something else, I'll have it all waiting for you when you come back.  Even better, my Live Tile updates constantly, so you can always see your last result at a glance, right from your Start Screen.

I'm attractive and effective and I make great use of your Windows 8 display.  If you feel like a change of scene, just tap one of the color theme buttons at the top of the screen.

Lastly, you can say goodbye to losing track of where you are in a calculation - I show you exactly what's happening at all times, in clear, elegant type.  If you do make a mistake, use backspace to quickly correct it, instead of starting over

Try me today and finally put that desktop calculator to rest!

This app is ad-funded.  For an ad-free experience, download the "Calculator!" app.

Awesome looking


            Love this calculator. Numbers are large, which is very nice. Gave it 4 stars.  I would love more themes and be able to minimize it within a second screen.

It's great!


            I like the size (the numbers are so big and easy to read) and the convenience of this calculator. It comes in handy when I'm sitting at my computer - I can just click on the icon and it comes right up.

            It's easy and convenient.  Only problem I have is sometimes the  decimal point   doesn't get entered very easy and have to go back.

Free Calculator


            I enjoy the background images and the calculator is accurate however its very slow. There is a delay between my putting in a number and the number showing up on the calculator, theres also a delay when you hit any of the other buttons (plus, times, equals - you get the picture).

Does not work well


            The audio of the voice is hard to understand, does not sound like a native English speaker, and has a lot of background static.  There is a drag and drop spelling game, but the letters are nearly impossible to move.  The shake spell game just wiggles the letters you touch, and the pop game just says the letter of the balloon you pop.  Which are fine for young children, but then why include words like "abacus"?

My kids enjoy using it, and they learn how to spell words while playing. Great concept. Easy to use. I highly recommend it!

miss pronounced letters


            I read the reviews and thought I would give it a try. I have two little ones that's still learning to spell. But I checked and ever word that had t in it was called p. The word was pronounced correct but then it was spelled with a p instead of the t sound. PLEASE CORRECT the pronouncing of letters.
