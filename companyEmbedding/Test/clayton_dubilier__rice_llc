Overview

			Based in New York and London, CD&R’s professionals reflect two different skill
			sets: our financial partners are experienced private equity investment professionals from 
			the world’s premier financial institutions and management advisory firms, whereas 
			our operating partners have collectively spent more than 300 years in senior management
			positions across a wide range of industry sectors at over 50 companies, notably ABB, BBA, BTR, Emerson Electric, GE, IBM and Unilever. 
			

            Operating Partners have 
            collectively spent more 
            than 300 years in 
            Senior Management positions
          
			Our Operating Partners participate in every phase of the investment process. They work closely with CD&R’s financial investment professionals on sourcing and due diligence, offering insights about the specific opportunities to boost productivity, innovation, product quality, revenue growth and profits. Together with the Financial Partners, they make judgments about strategy, senior leadership, human resource management systems, and practices in a wide variety of business functions. Operating Partners assume a particularly important role driving the post-acquisition business plan, management oversight, organizational effectiveness and value-building initiatives at portfolio companies. An Operating Partner or Operating Advisor serves as chairman, chairman of the executive committee, or lead director for each of the Firm’s portfolio companies.
						
			Financial partners focus on sourcing, financing or exiting investments, which includes developing relationships and a pipeline of investment ideas from intermediaries and corporate management teams and board members, originating new investment opportunities, conducting comprehensive due diligence on potential investments, structuring and financing new acquisitions and managing exit processes. They also work closely with Operating Partners and Operating Advisors on key strategic and operational initiatives at our portfolio companies.
			
			CD&R functions as a true partnership with a clear sense of shared purpose. Each Partner has different strengths and competencies, but all play important roles in sourcing transactions, conducting due diligence, making investment decisions and managing portfolio companies.
			

			From time to time in this website, reference is made to the “partners”, “financial partners” and “operating partners” of CD&R. These terms are used because they reflect the way in which the senior professionals of CD&R refer to themselves internally. Technically, however, such individuals are not “partners” of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC, which is a limited liability company. They instead are officers, employees, limited partners or members of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC and its affiliates.

Clayton, Dubilier & Rice to Acquire Europe's No.1 Vehicle Remarketing Company 

LONDON/NEW YORK - December 24, 2009 - Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC today announced a definitive agreement to acquire BCA, Europe's leading vehicle auctions and remarketing company from Montagu Private Equity.

With 45 remarketing centers spread across 12 countries, BCA annually sells over £4 billion of used vehicles, ranging from nearly-new and ex-lease stock to budget and older product. In addition to selling vehicles through physical auctions, BCA is experiencing significant growth from its online offering, and expects this to continue in the future. 
BCA also provides a variety of additional services to its customers including collections, deliveries, vehicle inspection, storage and vehicle preparation and cleaning. BCA serves the entire used vehicle buying community and this year has had more than 70,000 active buyers in the UK alone. It sells vehicles on behalf of a wide range of vendors including dealers, leasing companies, manufacturers and rental companies.

Fred Kindle, a London-based CD&R partner and former chief executive officer of ABB Group, will serve as Chairman of BCA.  Jon Olsen will remain Chief Executive Officer.  The management team will retain an equity stake in the company.

"BCA is a market-leading business-to-business services company with a strong management team and market position, attractive risk profile and exciting growth prospects," said David A. Novak, a London-based CD&R Partner.  "The company is exceptionally well positioned to build on an unmatched record of service excellence and innovation to continue to deliver high levels of performance." 

"Our work with Hertz and other similar services companies makes us very comfortable with the business model and value proposition of BCA," said David H. Wasserman, a New York-based CD&R Partner.  "We look forward to supporting the company as it pursues a number of exciting long-term growth opportunities, including expansion into new countries, the introduction of new services and strategic acquisitions."

"Clayton, Dubilier & Rice's record of building businesses aligns well with our objective to take BCA to the next level of profitable growth," said Mr. Olsen.  "Together with our new owners, we remain committed to providing our customers with the most innovative remarketing strategies that exploit all effective routes to market."    

CD&R recently completed investments in JohnsonDiversey, Inc., a leading global provider of commercial cleaning, sanitation and hygiene solutions, part of a broader recapitalization of the company valued at $2.6 billion, as well as a $250 million investment in NCI Building Systems (NYSE: NCS), one of North America's largest integrated manufacturers of metal products for the nonresidential building industry. 

Bank of America Merrill Lynch, BNP Paribas Fortis, Commerzbank, HSBC, Investec, Lloyds TSB, The Bank of Ireland, and The Royal Bank of Scotland have acted as joint mandated lead arrangers of the debt financing.  HSBC and BofA Merrill Lynch served as M&A advisors for CD&R. Clifford Chance and Debevoise & Plimpton served as legal advisors to CD&R, and tax and financial transaction services were provided by Ernst & Young.

The BCA transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2010.
