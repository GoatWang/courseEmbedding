Wind. It means the world to us.™Vestas is the only global energy company dedicated exclusively to wind energy. Wind is our business and our passion.

Founded in 1898 as a blacksmith shop in western Denmark, we started producing wind turbines in 1979, and have since gained a market-leading position with 83 GW of installed wind power and more than 71 GW under service across the globe, including close to 7 GW of non-Vestas turbines..  

Today, everyone at Vestas works to ensure that we deliver best-in-class wind energy solutions and set the pace in our industry to the benefit of our customers and our planet. If we continue to do this every day we will be the undisputed global wind leader.
