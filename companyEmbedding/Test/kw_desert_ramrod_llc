Complex systems, simple shopping
Understanding Air Conditioners


An air conditioner controls the temperature, humidity and general quality of the air in your home. As part of a central heating and cooling system, an air conditioner draws heat out of the house and transfers cooler air inside. When comparing Trane air conditioning systems, check the SEER (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio). Systems usually range from 13 to 23. A higher SEER rating means greater energy efficiency, similar to how a car with higher miles per gallon gets better fuel efficiency.

Matched systems, unmatched comfort
Complete Your HVAC System


The most common central air system is a split system, which includes an indoor unit and an outdoor unit. An air conditioner is an outdoor unit, usually installed in conjunction with a furnace or air handler. Trane matched systems can be customized with heating and cooling units that work best for your situation and let you choose the energy efficiency. To get the best information for your home, contact a local Trane Comfort Specialist.
