Clayton, Dubilier & Rice to Acquire Largest Distributor of Waterworks Products in the U.S.
Carve-Out of HD Supply's Waterworks Division Valued at $2.5 Billion


























NEW YORK, June 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Clayton, Dubilier & Rice ("CD&R") today announced an agreement with HD Supply Holding, Inc.                 

/quotes/zigman/17064684/composite HDS
+0.71%


 to acquire its Waterworks business unit ("Waterworks"), the nation's largest distributor of water, sewer, storm and fire protection products, for $2.5 billion. Through a carve-out transaction, Waterworks will become an independent company, wholly-owned by CD&R funds.


                                        








Waterworks is a leading U.S. distributor of industrial and construction products used to build and maintain underground water, wastewater and drainage infrastructure networks. The company operates a national network of 244 branches in 46 states with a sales team of more than 1,700 sales representatives serving a diverse customer base of more than 37,000 municipalities, private water companies and professional contractors. Waterworks will continue to be headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri.


                                        








Jim Berges, a CD&R Partner, will serve as Chairman of Waterworks.  Mr. Berges was Chairman of HD Supply from 2007 to 2015. CD&R invested in HD Supply in 2007 and exited the investment in 2014.  Previously, Mr. Berges served as Vice Chairman and President of Emerson Electric Co.


                                        








Steve LeClair, who has served as the President of Waterworks since 2011, will become the chief executive officer.  "This transaction is an important milestone in the strategic growth of Waterworks," said Mr. LeClair. "The Waterworks team is very excited to reunite with CD&R to accelerate our growth and productivity initiatives."


                                        








"Waterworks represents an attractive opportunity to invest in the leading distributor in the U.S. waterworks market, which stands to benefit from tailwinds in construction activity and municipal infrastructure spending," said CD&R Partner J.L. Zrebiec.  "With strong national, regional and local positions and a reputation for customer service and reliability, the company is in a very favorable long-term position."


                                        








"Through our prior investment in HD Supply, we have a great appreciation for the strength and quality of the Waterworks business and the exceptionally talented Waterworks management team," said CD&R Partner Nate Sleeper. "We are very excited to work alongside them once again to continue to build on the company's leading market position and pursue the many significant profitable growth opportunities available to it as a freestanding business."


                                        








CD&R has obtained committed financing from Barclays; BofA Merrill Lynch; Citi; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch; Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch; J.P. Morgan; and RBC Capital Markets, LLC. Barclays; BofA Merrill Lynch; Citi; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.; J.P. Morgan; and RBC Capital Markets, LLC acted as financial advisors to CD&R. Debevoise & Plimpton LLP served as CD&R's legal advisor in the transaction.

Overview

			Based in New York and London, CD&R’s professionals reflect two different skill
			sets: our financial partners are experienced private equity investment professionals from 
			the world’s premier financial institutions and management advisory firms, whereas 
			our operating partners have collectively spent more than 300 years in senior management
			positions across a wide range of industry sectors at over 50 companies, notably ABB, BBA, BTR, Emerson Electric, GE, IBM and Unilever. 
			

            Operating Partners have 
            collectively spent more 
            than 300 years in 
            Senior Management positions
          
			Our Operating Partners participate in every phase of the investment process. They work closely with CD&R’s financial investment professionals on sourcing and due diligence, offering insights about the specific opportunities to boost productivity, innovation, product quality, revenue growth and profits. Together with the Financial Partners, they make judgments about strategy, senior leadership, human resource management systems, and practices in a wide variety of business functions. Operating Partners assume a particularly important role driving the post-acquisition business plan, management oversight, organizational effectiveness and value-building initiatives at portfolio companies. An Operating Partner or Operating Advisor serves as chairman, chairman of the executive committee, or lead director for each of the Firm’s portfolio companies.
						
			Financial partners focus on sourcing, financing or exiting investments, which includes developing relationships and a pipeline of investment ideas from intermediaries and corporate management teams and board members, originating new investment opportunities, conducting comprehensive due diligence on potential investments, structuring and financing new acquisitions and managing exit processes. They also work closely with Operating Partners and Operating Advisors on key strategic and operational initiatives at our portfolio companies.
			
			CD&R functions as a true partnership with a clear sense of shared purpose. Each Partner has different strengths and competencies, but all play important roles in sourcing transactions, conducting due diligence, making investment decisions and managing portfolio companies.
			

			From time to time in this website, reference is made to the “partners”, “financial partners” and “operating partners” of CD&R. These terms are used because they reflect the way in which the senior professionals of CD&R refer to themselves internally. Technically, however, such individuals are not “partners” of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC, which is a limited liability company. They instead are officers, employees, limited partners or members of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC and its affiliates.

			CD&R functions as a true partnership with a clear sense of shared purpose. Each Partner has different strengths and competencies, but all play important roles in sourcing transactions, conducting due diligence, making investment decisions and managing portfolio companies.
			

			From time to time in this website, reference is made to the “partners”, “financial partners” and “operating partners” of CD&R. These terms are used because they reflect the way in which the senior professionals of CD&R refer to themselves internally. Technically, however, such individuals are not “partners” of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC, which is a limited liability company. They instead are officers, employees, limited partners or members of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC and its affiliates.

NEW YORK, June 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Clayton, Dubilier & Rice ("CD&R") today announced an agreement with HD Supply Holding, Inc. (NASDAQ:    HDS) to acquire its Waterworks business unit ("Waterworks"), the nation's largest distributor of water, sewer, storm and fire protection products, for $2.5 billion. Through a carve-out transaction, Waterworks will become an independent company, wholly-owned by CD&R funds. 








Waterworks is a leading U.S. distributor of industrial and construction products used to build and maintain underground water, wastewater and drainage infrastructure networks. The company operates a national network of 244 branches in 46 states with a sales team of more than 1,700 sales representatives serving a diverse customer base of more than 37,000 municipalities, private water companies and professional contractors. Waterworks will continue to be headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri.
Jim Berges, a CD&R Partner, will serve as Chairman of Waterworks.  Mr. Berges was Chairman of HD Supply from 2007 to 2015. CD&R invested in HD Supply in 2007 and exited the investment in 2014.  Previously, Mr. Berges served as Vice Chairman and President of Emerson Electric Co. 
Steve LeClair, who has served as the President of Waterworks since 2011, will become the chief executive officer.  "This transaction is an important milestone in the strategic growth of Waterworks," said Mr. LeClair. "The Waterworks team is very excited to reunite with CD&R to accelerate our growth and productivity initiatives." 
"Waterworks represents an attractive opportunity to invest in the leading distributor in the U.S. waterworks market, which stands to benefit from tailwinds in construction activity and municipal infrastructure spending," said CD&R Partner J.L. Zrebiec.  "With strong national, regional and local positions and a reputation for customer service and reliability, the company is in a very favorable long-term position." 
"Through our prior investment in HD Supply, we have a great appreciation for the strength and quality of the Waterworks business and the exceptionally talented Waterworks management team," said CD&R Partner Nate Sleeper. "We are very excited to work alongside them once again to continue to build on the company's leading market position and pursue the many significant profitable growth opportunities available to it as a freestanding business."
CD&R has obtained committed financing from Barclays; BofA Merrill Lynch; Citi; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; Deutsche Bank AG Cayman Islands Branch; Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch; J.P. Morgan; and RBC Capital Markets, LLC. Barclays; BofA Merrill Lynch; Citi; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.; J.P. Morgan; and RBC Capital Markets, LLC acted as financial advisors to CD&R. Debevoise & Plimpton LLP served as CD&R's legal advisor in the transaction.
