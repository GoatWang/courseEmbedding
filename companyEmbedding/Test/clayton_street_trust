What is 'Antitrust'
Antitrust laws are the laws that apply to virtually all industries and to every level of business, including manufacturing, transportation, distribution and marketing. They prohibit a variety of practices that restrain trade. Examples of illegal practices are price-fixing conspiracies, corporate mergers likely to reduce the competitive vigor of particular markets, and predatory acts designed to achieve or maintain monopoly power.

BREAKING DOWN 'Antitrust'
Antitrust laws are necessary in an open marketplace. Competition among sellers gives consumers lower prices, higher-quality products and services, more choice, and greater innovation.History of Antitrust LawsCongress passed the Sherman Act in 1890, outlawing contracts and conspiracies restraining trade and/or monopolizing industries. For example, competing individuals or businesses may not fix prices, divide markets or rig bids. In 1914, Congress passed the Federal Trade Commission Act, banning unfair competition methods and deceptive acts or practices. The Clayton Act was passed the same year, addressing specific practices the Sherman Act does not prohibit. For example, the Clayton Act prohibits having the same person make business decisions for competing corporations. The three antitrust laws describe unlawful mergers and business practices in general terms, leaving courts to decide which ones are illegal based on facts of each case.Enforcing Antitrust LawsThe FTC focuses on segments of the economy where consumer spending is high, such as healthcare, pharmaceuticals, professional services, food, energy, computer technology and Internet services. Premerger notification filings, consumer or business correspondence, Congressional inquiries or articles on consumer or economic subjects could trigger an FTC investigation. If the FTC believes a law is or may be violated, the agency attempts stopping the disputed practices or resolving the anti-competitive aspects of the proposed merger. If the attempt fails, the FTC issues an administrative complaint and/or injunctive relief in federal court.The FTC may refer evidence of criminal antitrust violations to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for criminal sanctions. The DOJ has jurisdiction in telecommunications, banks, railroads and airlines. The FTC and DOJ also work with regulatory agencies in ensuring certain mergers fit the public interest.Example of Antitrust Law ViolationIn early 2015, Google reached an antitrust settlement with the European Commission. The main provisions of the agreement ensure Google displays results from at least three competitors each time it shows results for specialized searches related to products, restaurants and travel. Competitors pay Google each time someone clicks on specific types of results shown next to Google’s results. The search engine pays for an independent monitor overseeing the process.Content providers such as Yelp may decide to not have their content included in Google’s specialized search services. The providers are not penalized in Google’s normal search rankings as a result of their decision. The search giant removed conditions making it difficult for advertisers to move their campaigns to competing sites; sites using Google’s search tool may now show ads from other services. The agreement lasts for five years and affects any search and promoted-product services Google introduces in Europe.

                I particularly like the 'antipasto sardo' to start, a sacillian meat and bread platter serves 2, and the 'Crespelle con Ricotta e Spinaci'  a crepe ricotta dish for main, both gorgeous.

  FB Financial Corporation (the "Company") (NYSE: FBK) announced today that it has entered into an amendment to its Stock Purchase Agreement for its previously announced acquisition of Clayton Bank and Trust and American City Bank (collectively, the "Clayton Banks") from Clayton HC, Inc., the sole shareholder of the Clayton Banks. The parties agreed to the amendment to address competitive concerns raised by the Federal Reserve Board with respect to Clayton HC's post-closing ownership of the Company's shares and continued ownership of 50% of Apex Bancorp, Inc., the bank holding company for Apex Bank, a bank headquartered in Camden, Tennessee.  The Stock Purchase Agreement has been amended (the "Amendment") to reduce the stock portion of the consideration to be received by Clayton HC such that Clayton HC's post-closing ownership in the Company will be less than 5% of the outstanding shares. The Amendment provides for reducing the stock consideration from 5,860,000 shares to 1,521,200 shares and for a cash payment to Clayton HC of $124.2 million at closing as consideration for the reduced stock consideration. Additionally, the Amendment gives the Company, through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary FirstBank, the option to reduce or eliminate the $60 million subordinated note to be issued to Clayton HC at closing by paying cash in lieu of all or a portion of the principal amount of such note.  FB Financial's President and CEO Chris Holmes stated, "We believe the amended terms are positive for our shareholders in a number of ways. We expect the acquisition will provide incremental earnings per share accretion in 2018 and 2019, reaching approximately 20 percent annually, versus our 15 percent-plus estimate previously announced in February. Furthermore, we now expect the increased capital will positively impact our pro forma capital ratios relative to the terms of the original structure announced in February while also materially reducing the projected tangible book value dilution at closing. We now expect the capital dilution to be earned back by the end of 2017."

SEC's Clayton Takes Hard Line on Activist Shareholder Proposal

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton




















 Recently installed Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton on Wednesday suggested that the agency will take a closer look at the growth of activist investor shareholder proposals, arguing that there was a cost quiet investors pay to cover the idiosyncratic interests of others. "It is very important to ask ourselves how much of a cost there is," Clayton said at an event at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. "We have to ask ourselves, 'how much costs should the quiet shareholder, the ordinary shareholder, bear for idiosyncratic interests of other [investors]." At issue is an SEC rule that allows a shareholder to submit a non-binding proposal when they own $2000 or more worth of shares for one year. Corporations have been lobbying heavily to have the SEC cut back on the large numbers of proposals submitted every year at corporations, arguing that they add needless costs and often focus on frivolous matters. "Any time there are deeply held views by a few people but it gets spread over to a lot of people you have a tendency to not look at who's bearing those costs," Clayton added. The measures, usually submitted by activist public pension funds, typically fall into a few categories, including efforts to encourage companies to make changes focused on corporate governance improvements and initiatives focusing on environmental policies.  Thousands of shareholder proposals have been submitted at U.S. corporations over the years, many of which receive a majority vote of shareholders. Strong backing for some proposals year-over-year has helped push companies to remove anti-takeover protections, install more independent directors and even move to eliminate workplace discrimination. Nevertheless, Republican SEC commissioner Michael Piwowar backed Clayton's comments, arguing that "special interest" investors are imposing costs on average main street investors. "We could do something on this on our own," Piwowar said to reporters at the U.S. Chamber, suggesting that no act of Congress was needed. "The chairman sets the agenda, but I'm going to be meeting with folks at public companies to talk about their experiences with proxy season." Clayton's comments come as the lawmakers on Capitol Hill consider a measure attached to a financial deregulation bill, the Financial Choice Act, which if approved would effectively make it impossible for most if not all shareholder proponents to submit proposals. In addition, the U.S. Chamber issued a paper Wednesday to coincide with Clayton's comments, seeking to cut down on the number of proposals submitted by activist public pension funds and other investors. The U.S. chamber's package of recommendations is less tough on shareholder proposals than the measure under consideration on Capitol Hill. However, the measure already has backers of the current regime unnerved. A key provision in the U.S. Chamber's plan is to make it much more difficult for shareholders who have not received much support for their proposals to resubmit them at the company the following year. The current resubmission rule allows a company to exclude a shareholder proposal if it failed to receive the backing of 3% of shareholders if voted on once in the last five years. It also has various other triggers for prohibitions on resubmissions, including one that allows a company to exclude a resubmission if it received less than 10% three or more times in the last five years. The Chamber urged the SEC to revisit a proposal introduced in 1997 under Clinton Administration chairman Arthur Levitt that would prohibit a shareholder proposal resubmission if it garnered less than 6% if voted on once in the past five years or less than 30% if voted on three or more times in the past five years. The House bill would take the restrictions a step further by requiring activist shareholders seeking to submit proposals at publicly-traded U.S. corporations to hold 1% of their target company's shares for three years. In addition, Clayton also suggested that the agency would take a tough look at the growing influence of shareholder advisory firms, predominantly Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. and Glass, Lewis & Co. LLC. Both ISS AND Glass Lewis make influential recommendations to institutional investors about M&A and for or against dissident director candidates nominated by activist fund managers.  Clayton suggested that there has been an evolution over the years, with the result being that the proxy advisory firms have become much more influential. "We've now had that evolution and have some entities that have a fair amount of influence on governance of our public companies and as regulators, developments that have a substantial impact on our market is what we should look at," he said.  It is possible that the SEC could impose new tougher rules on the advisers, such as requirements that they give companies a lengthy period to review preliminary recommendations before they are issued to investor clients. Such a requirement could make it harder for the firms to issue recommendations and meet key deadlines. Insurgent funds often get a boost in support from other shareholders for their director candidates when ISS and Glass Lewis recommend that investors vote for activist-backed dissident nominees. The directors, if elected, often push companies to engage in mergers, break ups, share buybacks, special dividends or other share-price improving changes.
