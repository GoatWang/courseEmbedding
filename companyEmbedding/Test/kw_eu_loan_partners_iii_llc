June 19--BiondVax Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (Nasdaq: BVXV; (TASE:BVXV), which is developing a universal vaccine for all strains of influenza, today announced the signing of an agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) for a euro20 million ($22 million) loan. The money will be used to fund a Phase III trial (a multi-center effectiveness trial) for BiondVax's product. The company has been ready for the trial for several years already, but did not start it because of a lack of money, among other reasons. The company's share price jumped 2.25% on the news today, boosting its market cap to NIS 123 million.
The EIB is the European Union's (EU) long-term lending institution, which offers long-term financing for investments that contribute to EU policy goals. Its support for development of the BiondVax vaccine was part of the Horizon 2020 initiative, the EU's research program, in which Israeli is also participating. The loan is being granted in the InnovFin Infectious Diseases framework, designed for budgeting high-risk infectious disease projects.
BiondVax has conducted Phase II trials, which showed that its vaccine is safe, and that combining it with a seasonal vaccine can extend the seasonal vaccine's coverage. The company previously stated that it was likely to enter the market with its product as improving the seasonal vaccine, but its long-term vision is to offer a single vaccine that will offer protection against influenza for many years.
Ruth Arnon developed, Nacht invested
The EU previously funded a BiondVax Phase IIb trial as part of its Seventh Framework Programme for technological research and development.
BiondVax CEO Dr. Ron Babecoff said, "We now have the resources required to launch Phase III clinical trials, and to set up a medium-sized plant for commercial production. The EIB's financing is therefore a huge step forward for BiondVax on the way to bringing the M-001 vaccine to market."
BiondVax was founded by Babecoff, who acquired the technology on which the company's product is based from the Weizmann Institute of Science, where it was developed by Professor Ruth Arnon, one of the developers of Copaxone, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.'s (NYSE: TEVA; TASE: TEVA) drug for treatment of multiple sclerosis. Several months ago, BiondVax obtained an investment from aMoon Partners, a company controlled by Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq: CHKP) cofounder Marius Nacht. aMoon now has a 19% stake in BiondVax, making it the sole significant shareholder in the company.

And he’s got a massive empire to go with that title. His empire encompasses not just e-commerce, but also news organizations, robotics companies and coupon sites. Oh, and ever heard of Google, Airbnb or Uber? Bezos is an investor in those companies, too. On Thursday, Bezos’s net worth hit $90.7 billion, propelling him past Bill Gates to become the richest person in the world, according to the billionaire rankings done by Forbes and Bloomberg. On his way to that title, Bezos has made a number of investments and acquisitions.

Boeing's shares were upgraded by RBC, Credit Suisse, BofA Merrill Lynch, and Goldman Sachs. This was based on our analysis of Boeing historical results that showed it generates its best margins when revenue is weighted towards planes that have been in production for many years, and margins have typically come under pressure when it introduces new models, as we expected with the 737 MAX and, eventually, 777X. While nearly all of the ramp on the MAX is yet to come, Boeing’s smooth transition to the MAX so far shows that this is nothing like the prior derivative programs (737 Classic to 737NG and 747-400 to 747-8) that drove significant operating issues for Boeing in the past.5Reactions.
