Jim Ratcliffe – A Profile by The Sunday Times
You may not have head of Jim Ratcliffe, but he is in your life from the moment you wake up until you go to sleep. He is responsible for the plastic cap on your toothpaste tube to the chlorine that cleans the water you use to brush your teeth. Many of the things you use during the day that are made using chemicals “we’ve had a hand in,” he says with a smile. This includes our clothes, our car, our furniture, and the packages our food and medicines come in.  Describing Jim as “Britain’s most successful post war industrialist”, John Arlidge asks him about his views on manufacturing, investments, shale gas and his latest project to build an uncompromising 4x4.

Big Boats - A Bold Plan
Whilst European gas production is crumbling, America's is booming. INEOS has a bold, pioneering plan: to ship US ethane gas to Europe bringing competitive advantage from America into Europe.
Five short films document the design and build of highly advanced, sustainable fleet of eight vessels that will be essential in supporting the INEOS plan. They are the largest, most flexible, advanced multigas carriers ever built.
“People said it couldn’t be done. At INEOS we believe everything is possible.” Jim Ratcliffe.
