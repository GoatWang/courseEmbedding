高級中學基礎地球科學課程標準



　

第一　目　　標



壹、總目標



  
－為配合提昇科學素養，促進生涯發展，並奠定學術研究之基礎，高級中學地球科學課程總目標如下：




　　　一、激發學習地球科學之意願與關切珍惜地球環境之意識。




　　　二、認識地球科學有關地質、海洋、氣象、天文方面    
重要基本概念，以增進探討該類學科之興趣與

　　　　　學習基礎。




　　　三、瞭解地球科學有關觀察、分析、推論、歸納與處理判斷問題之方法，以提昇學生解決問題之能力。


貳、重點目標




　　　一、瞭解有關地球形態、組成、構造、活動、歷史及在宇宙中的地位等基本概念。




　　　二、增進學習地球科學之興趣與意願，並培養關心、珍惜地球環境之正確態度。




　　　三、培養學生活用地球科學基本概念與方法及解決問題之能力。



 




第二　時間分配




　　　由於高一基礎地球科學為一學期之課程，可安排於第一學期或第二學期，每週二節。



 




第三　教材綱要




主題




內容




節數







第一章     
        緒論


一、我們為什麼要學習地球科學


 


　
 


二、地球科學的學科特性


　
　
　


 


（一）地球科學涵蓋的範疇很廣，包括地質、

　　　海洋、氣象及天
		文等，學習這些學問

　　　可以幫我
		助們瞭解地球。


（二）認識地球的變化、運作、歷史及資源

　　　是現代公民的基本素養。


地球科學的特性包括：


（一）探討的空間及時間尺度大。


（二）
		許多問題無法靠實驗解決，必須到野外

　　　實地調查。


（三）強調地域性的特徵。

第二章     
        板塊構造學說


一、地球的層圈構造


 


　
二、板塊邊界的類型


 


　
　
三、證據


 


四、台灣附近的板塊構造


　


 


（一）根據地震波波速
		差異，地球內部可分為

　　　地核、地函、地殼。
（二）軟流圈以上的岩石圈是板塊的集合體。


（一）原國中教科書有關板塊邊界類型及相關

　　　地質作用移至此處。


（二）
		依板塊間的相對運動可分為：

　　　張裂性
		、聚合性、錯動性。




可根據古生物、古氣候（冰川、煤層、沙漠分佈）、中洋脊附近磁極倒轉對稱排列的記錄等來佐證。

第三章     
        岩漿活動


一、板塊構造運動與岩漿活動


二、中洋脊地區的岩漿活動─


玄武岩的生成


三、隱沒帶地區的
		岩漿活動─　　

　環太平洋安山岩的生成

第四　實施方法



壹、教材編選之要領




　　一、本科教科用書指教科書、學生實習手冊及教師手冊三種。




　　二、教科書之編寫，應根據教材綱要內容重點把握課程目標，並配合學生認知能力與學習原理，

　　　　以生動有趣之方式（可不必照教材綱要之順序）呈現學習內容與過程。




　　三、教材除應與國民中學地球科學銜接之外，更應註重課程中之基本概念能與日常生活中的經驗

　　　　相結合。

　　四、教科書份量應與各學期實際可上課教學節數相配合。故教材份量之規劃以一學期十五週，每週

　　　　二節為原則，每單元之授課節數可視各單元份量之多寡，作彈性之間分配。




　　五、教科書之文字敘述力求淺顯生動活潑，儘量避免過多的專業術語，為提高學生的學習效果及興趣

　　　　應附主題清楚之圖表和彩色照片。




　　六、教科書應儘量附有實習活動，使學生經由活動中瞭解基本概念，以提高學習興趣。




　　七、教科書每一學習單元應附作業，提供學生進行分析、歸與推理活動。




　　八、教師手冊除明列各單元之具體教學目標及評量要領外，亦應提供達成目標之適當教學方法，以及

　　　　教具、教學媒體與作業指導等。



貳、教學方法




　　一、配合教科書內容重點，教師可補充與鄉土或生活相關之題材及資料，以引起學習動機；教學方法

　　　　儘量使用觀測、參觀、調查、討論、報告等方式，使學習過程生動多變化。




　　二、教師教學時宜引導學生思考討論所提供之資料或觀測數據，使學生經由主動參與分析歸納而形成

　　　　基本概念；並啟發其學習地球科學知識的興趣及愛護地球環境的情操。




　　三、教師教學應儘量利用各種教學資源進行教學，如儀器、掛圖、圖片、模型、標本、幻燈片、投影

　　　　片、影片、錄影帶等，以提高效果。




　　四、教師教學時，可運用單元活動之方式，使之更具有彈性，以適應時令季節與地方之特性。



參、教具及有關教學設備




　　一、各校應依教育部所頒布之「高級中學設備標準」設置地球科學專科教室、準備室、器材室。

　　　　專科教
室必須具備各項視聽教學設備、實驗器材、模型、標本、圖表、掛圖等。專科教室得配置

　　　　管理人員。




　　二、學校應充實地球科學教學參考資料，除相關書籍之外，宜多購置有關期刊、雜誌，以供生參考。




　　三、為充分發揮視聽教學效果，視聽教材應由相關單位發展製作、並購置配發各校使用。



肆、教學評量




　　一、教學評量應在教學前、教學中、教學後進行。評量的結果可作為瞭解學生起點行為、調整教學目標

　　　　與回饋、診斷與補救教學之依據。




　　二、教學評量範圍除認知及技能目標外，宜兼顧情意目標。




　　三、教學評量方法宜多樣化，除測驗外，可採討論、實作、觀測紀錄、參觀、報告等方法。
