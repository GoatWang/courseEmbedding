My father is my hero, he seems can do anything well. When he is at work, he acts as a consultant, his coworkers always ask him about dealing with difficult cases. After work, he is still busy. He is a volunteer of KMT, he helps a lot about election affairs. He is an important cadre in our community, responsible for resident welfare and environmental maintenance. He also spends lots of time taking care of our relatives. If there is someone get in trouble, he tries his best to help him/her out; if someone get sick, he is asked to go to the hospital together. He is so reliable.I have learned a lot from my father. He has a good temper, never get angry easily. He is very thoughtful, always takes care of people around him. He believes that "a rolling stone gathers no moss", so he always improves himself if needed. The most important thing is that he loves me so much. He cares about me, listens to my words , and teaches me how to be a better man. I really love and respect him. He is a great father, a good teacher, a closed friend, and an excellent hero in my mind.

謝謝大家的意見，尤其謝謝LionEnglish的解答，我知道這樣不是很好，但因為我弟太急著一次把想學的東西學完，所以同時修兩個學校的在職學分，白天又有工作，實在是焦頭爛額了，所以我才幫他這次...他下學期會先停掉其中一間，好專心把功課都做好，再次感謝各位啦~

After work, he is still busy. He is a volunteer of KMT, and he helps a lot with election affairs. He plays an important role in our community, responsible for the welfare of the people and the maintenance of the environment. He spends a lot of time taking care of our relatives, too. If there is someone getting in trouble, he tries his best to help him or her out; if someone gets sick, he is the one who is asked to go to the hospital with the patient. He is such a reliable person.

其實姊弟情深也很好。只是像 Prisoner 和我這種美國住久的人，榮譽變成生活的一部分，有點酸氣，太註重誠實了！美國人學術比較不喜歡作假，一生的成就，可能因一次作假被逮就前功盡棄了。

我是個英文很爛的五專生..... 

In recent years, when Taiwan suffers from the earthquake and typhoon, always has a serious problem－the debris flow. To be a Taiwanese, I think it is time that we might to solve this important natural calcmities. 

Why is this natural calamities so serious? Taiwan has very steep and loose geology, and Taiwan people like to chew the betel nut so you can see the betel palm everywhere in Taiwan－even in the hillside. May be you will say: so what? The betel palm is a kind of plant, and plant can grasp the ground. The debris flow problem will be better, that is a good way to solve this natural calcmities! I will say: no! It\'s a misconception, the betel palm\'s root is short that can\'t grasp the ground. When typhoon and downpour coming, the ground can\'t absorbent heavy rain. The ground will be soft and loose, and the mud and stone glide to submontane, the debris flow will happen. Also, Taiwanese like to build the cottage home on hill side, like the betel palm, this behavior will accelerated debris flow.  

Before the decade, Taiwan people didn\'t know how the debris flow will be critically that will their safety.  But after typhoon, earthquake and downpour attack our hillside and we suffer the debris flow－some people dead in the debris flow.  They cover up under the earth, this natural calamities are very terrible, doesn\'t it? 

How should we solve this natural calamities?  First, even it\'s too late to tree planting, I still think we might plant more trees on the hillside.  Those trees can help us to do the soil and water conservation will.  Taiwan\'s farmer also need to make a plan what they plant on the hillside.  Is the ground adaption to plant?  Is this cropper can grasp the ground?  Maybe it\'s a stupid idea that will let then lose some money, but lose money or lose life, who wants to lose life?

更新: 
And there are lots of problem in the world, like:  Greenhouse Effect, Air Pollution, Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, World Energy…those problem in every country in the beautiful globe, so we can't just know how those natural calamities so serious and danger to our life.

更新 2: 
We must do something that can help us solve these problem, and return us good country and life like before.

更新 3: 
For example:  in the summer, we can use an electric fan or we can use the electric fan with the air conditioning.  When we buy refrigerator, we can choose to the eco- refrigerant one.  Besides, we also can take public transportation, not drive alone.

更新 4: 
Maybe you think these things are not important and waste your time, but don't you think if everybody does that will be very useful? 
以上補充為一段....=.=

更新 5: 
I don't know how you feel about this world.  But for me, I love my country and this world especially Africa and going there is my dream. So I hope we can solve those natural calcmities and have better life,  after all,  we only have one earth.

My nitpicking. :) 引文:(for) a moment, a minute, a second, a short while...Although these phrases describe a very short period, they are still duration of time, and the verb tense used is therefore should not be simple past.A: Will you be gone/there for long? B: No, just a moment.A: How long will you be using it? B: Just a minute.A: How much longer do I have to wait? B: Not much, just a minute more.

I don't think it's nitpicking.  這兩句"Will you go there for long?""How much longer am I gonna wait?"確實有點怪。

Thanks a lot, Birdman.是的，在一段時間中，不適合用瞬間動詞，例如 go。 It's my error. 你翻譯得很好。(I have deleted my translation lest it misleads others.  )

I have been to a Disneyland in Shanghai. As is known,Disneyland is the oldest theme park in the world. It is also the most popular park in the world. In the park, you can not only enjoy the exciting activities,but also get close to the life-size cartoon characters, such as the Mickey Mouse and his girlfriend. There are other places of interest, too. I like the roller-coaster the best. Jump into the train, then the exciting trip begin. When you are tired, you can buy foods and drinks to relax.

I went the park near my school with my family on Sunday. This park was holding a interesting garden party, where was crowded by many people. When sunday, the park was always very crowded. There was a lot of old men doing morning exercises, and many children going with their parents. During our around walking, I saw my classmate XX boating there. I said hello to her, and she asked me to enjoy boating with her. So I took the boat, and speaked with XX for a while. Then we pulled the boat over, where planted a few lilies,which was my faverate flower. I used my digital camera taking several picture. At that time, my cellphone was ringing. That is my mother, she call me for going back.

 顏瑞芳表示，題目沒有特別要求用中文寫作，但這畢竟是國文科，全篇用英文寫，這麼多年來也是第一次發現。要由大考中心開會討論如何給分，幫忙翻成中文也是可能的選項。 另外，也有一人把「關於經驗的N種思考」寫成兩篇作文。顏瑞芳說，考生可能犯了誤解題意的錯誤，但畢竟有完成答題，閱捲老師會選其中一篇來決定分數高低。 顏瑞芳也說，題目雖然是「關於經驗的N種思考」，但寫成「一種」也可以，畢竟一也是自然數。但只寫一個層面，論述寬度較容易受侷限，可能較難拿高分。 學測國文科107年將有大變革，作文和選擇題分開考，各80分鐘。顏瑞芳表示，作文部分分成兩大題，都需長篇論述，可能一篇知性，一篇感性，希望考生兼具兩種能力。 顏瑞芳說，80分鐘內要寫兩篇長篇，的確會有點「趕」，高中考能要多訓練一下時間分配，不能把60分鐘都用在同一題，另一篇只剩20分鐘來寫。 東森報導，對於英文答題要先翻譯再給分的說法，引起許多網友討論，有網友就說，「早知道我英文作文也用中文寫！」、「是國文科當然用中文回答啊」、「這個開放下去，以後哪科若沒講清楚，大概會出現各國語言答題。」但也有網友認為，作文題目都出現「N」這個英文字了，也沒規定要用中文回答，「跳脫一般思維，勇於挑戰傳統」。更有網友問道，「他是怎麼把英文寫在格子裡的啊，太強了」。 顏瑞芳表示，評閱重點依據「題旨發揮」、「資料掌握」、「結構安排」、「字句運用」四項指標。凡能針對「經驗」舉出事例加以思考、論證，見解深刻，結構嚴謹，文詞優美者，得A等（19-27分）；能大致掌握題目要求，舉例尚稱貼切，結構大致完整，文筆平順，修辭尚可者，得B等；未舉證或舉例欠當，見解浮泛，結構鬆散，文筆拙劣者，得C等（1-9分）。文未終篇，或一段成文，至多B+（18分）。另視標點符號的使用與錯別字的多寡，斟酌扣分。 聯合報導，顏瑞芳舉出一份Ａ等標準捲為例，第一段分析經驗有很多好處，但也可能帶來盲點，「經驗能載舟亦能覆舟」；第二段舉愛迪生、居禮夫人等「累積經驗而成功」的名人例子；第三段舉耶魯大學曾做過的「數兔子腳」實驗，如事先提醒「有陷阱」，受測者反而不易答出正確數目，「經驗扮演思想的牢籠」，有時會因前人經驗提醒，反而受到侷限；最後一段總結經驗像看湖中倒影，可看見自己得失，卻也可能使人迷失在虛幻影像中，忘了自己站在岸上。

作者sutzuhao (Butterfly's sleep)看板RESIT標題英文作文時間Tue Jul 24 12:57:01 2007
樓樓樓樓上有人po英文選擇題的答題方法，那我就來po一下作文的方法...

我覺得英文作文算是很運氣的東西，所以一定要"慎選考區"啊...

我應屆考學測是在臺中考的，拿17分 (然後申請就上了，沒考指考)

今年重考，學測在臺北考，只拿13.5 (我覺得寫的比應屆那年還好...)

指考又回臺中考，拿17.5分 (可是真的寫得很爛，真的...冏)

所以可以合理推斷北部的高中生比較會寫作文，這是毋庸置疑的＝ ＝

----

指考英文作文這種東西，除非你想在北部拿15分以上，否則不用寫得太難

不用把一句簡單的話刻意複雜化，那在改題教授看來根本是很可笑吧...

請用"小學生的腦袋"來想你要寫出什麼內容，

只要寫出的東西很像美國的小學生寫出的作文，分數應該都不差

----

時態的話，建議多用簡單式(過去、現在、未來)就好了，

另外熟悉一下假設語氣的用法，像今年考沒有電的話會怎樣，就是假設性的題目

其他複雜的時態大可不必。

----

字數的話，絕對不是越多越好。人家叫你寫120個字，就差不多寫到120~140就可以停了，

寫太多通常表示你不知道該如何結尾...不會加分的

另外字體最好寫得工整又不會太小，用0.5的筆比較好

另外請用立可帶，立可白這種東西早該淘汰了...(用立可白改完常常會忘記)

----

俗語(像honesty is the best policy這種)並不是考高分所必要的，

當然你要背幾句也是無妨，

我覺得重要的是背"佳句"，比如：

Experience is the best teacher, she punishes our stupidity and laziness.

But we never forget her lessons.

只要背這簡單的一句話，字數就增加不少。當然其中有許多單字是可以變換的，

比如把laziness改為rashness...等，這樣就有更多情況可以用此句。

而佳句可以分類，分"開頭"、"文中"、"結尾" 時用，

比如開頭可以寫：

As is known to everyone, (   ) plays an important role in modern society.

雖然很老套，可是請放心的用，沒人說老套就不能拿高分，只要通順有理就好。

佳句的來源就在平時閱讀文章時抄錄在自己的筆記本上，

記得分類，並且想想這個句子何時可以用？什麼主題可以用？

----

我考前寫完的英文自修有常春藤的作文和翻譯兩本，

文殷出的那本五合一翻譯作文殺小魔法書上下冊

然後還有常春藤雜誌。

我覺得每天固定花2～3小時來準備英文是必要的，

單字、片語、每天都要撥出時間看，

文法應該早早看完，然後大量閱讀文章來檢視

考前一個禮拜請把重心放在作文，多背佳句。

英文基本上是報酬率超高又不太可能失常的科目，好好把握吧
